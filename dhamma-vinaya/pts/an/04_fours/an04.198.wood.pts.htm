					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />
					is a self-tormentor,<br />
					given to the practice of self-torment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again a certain person<br />
					is a tormentor of another,<br />
					given to the practice of tormenting another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br />
					is a tormentor both of self and another,<br />
					and given to the practice of tormenting <br />
					both self and another.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet again, monks, a certain person<br />
					is a tormentor neither of self nor of another,<br />
					not given to the practice of tormenting self and another<br />
					he who torments neither self nor another<br />
					in this very life is no more hungry,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					one who has penetrated bliss,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					a self-tormentor,<br />
					one given to the practice of self-torment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> goes naked,<br />
					he has loose habits,<br />
					he licks his hands clean,<br />
					he will have none of your</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come in, your reverence!"</p>

					<p class="f4">or</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stop a bit, your reverence!"</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses food brought to him,<br />
					he refuses special food,<br />
					he refuses an invitation to a meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses food straight from the pot<br />
					or straight from the pan,<br />
					or within the threshould of a door,<br />
					or among the firewood,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or among the rice-pounders.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses food<br />
					when a couple are eating,<br />
					or from a pregnant <a id="pg2190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> woman,<br />
					from a woman giving suck,<br />
					or from one having intercourse with a man.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses food<br />
					from a mixed collection,<br />
					or where a dog stands by,<br />
					or where flies are swarming.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eats neither fish nor flesh,<br />
					drinks no liquor or intoxicant,<br />
					not even rice-gruel.</p>

					<p class="f4">He asks an alms from one house only,<br />
					an eater of one mouthful,<br />
					or maybe begs from two houses,<br />
					eats two mouthfuls only,<br />
					or maybe begs from three houses,<br />
					eats three mouthfuls only,<br />
					or maybe begs from four houses,<br />
					eats four mouthfuls only,<br />
					or maybe begs from five houses,<br />
					eats five mouthfuls only,<br />
					or maybe begs from six houses,<br />
					eats six mouthfuls only,<br />
					or maybe begs from seven houses,<br />
					eats seven mouthfuls	only.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exists on just one little dole of food,<br />
					or on just two little doles,<br />
					or on just three little doles,<br />
					or on just four little doles,<br />
					or on just five little doles,<br />
					or on just six little doles,<br />
					or on just seven little doles.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes food only once a day<br />
					he takes food only once in two days<br />
					he takes food only once in three days<br />
					he takes food only once in four days<br />
					he takes food only once in five days<br />
					he takes food only once in six days<br />
					he takes food only once in seven days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he lives given to the practice<br />
					of taking food by rule,<br />
					even to the interval of half a month.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feeds on vegetables,<br />
					on millet,<br />
					on raw rice,<br />
					on scraps of leather,<br />
					on water-plants,<br />
					rice-powder,<br />
					burnt scum of rice,<br />
					flour of oil-seeds,<br />
					on grass<br />
					and cowdung.</p>

					<p class="f4">He just exists<br />
					on forest roots<br />
					and fallen fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">He wears coarse hempen clothes,<br />
					cloth of different fibres,<br />
					discarded corpse-cloths,<br />
					rags from a rubbish heap,<br />
					tree-bark fibre,<br />
					antelope skins,<br />
					strips of antelope skin,<br />
					clothes made of kusa grass,<br />
					made of wood shavings,<br />
					blankets made of human hair,<br />
					made of horsehair,<br />
					made of owls' wings.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a plucker out of hair and beard<br />
					and given to this practice.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains standing<br />
					and refuses a seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">He squats down<br />
					and keeps a squatting posture.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a "bed-of-thorns" man,<br />
					he makes his bed on spikes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives given to the practice<br />
					of going down to the water to bathe<br />
					even a third time in the evening also.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus in divers ways<br />
					he lives given to these practices<br />
					which torment the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br />
					is a self-tormentor<br />
					and given to that practice.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					a tormentor of another<br />
					and given to that practice?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person is a butcher,<br />
					a pig-killer,<br />
					a fowler,<br />
					deer-stalker,<br />
					a hunter,<br />
					a fisherman,<br />
					a bandit,<br />
					an executioner,<br />
					a jailer,<br />
					or (one of) any others<br />
					who follow a bloody calling.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg220"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></a> That, monks, is how a person<br />
					tortures another<br />
					and is given to such practice of torture.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					a tormentor of both self and another<br />
					and given to the practice of tormenting self and another?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />
					is a rajah or nobleman who has been consecrated,<br />
					or a brahmin of a great house.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having built a new mote-hall<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on the east side of a town,<br />
					he gets his head and beard shaved,<br />
					dons a shaggy skin,<br />
					smears his body with ghee and oil,<br />
					scratches his back with a deer's horn<br />
					and enters the mote-hall<br />
					together with his chief wife<br />
					and brahmin chaplain.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he makes his bed<br />
					upon the bare<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> grass-covered ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the rajah lives<br />
					on the milk from one teat of a cow<br />
					with calf of like colour;<br />
					his chief wife lives<br />
					on the milk from the second teat;<br />
					the brahmin chaplain lives<br />
					on the milk from the third teat,<br />
					while that from the fourth<br />
					they offer as sacrifice to the fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">The calf is fed with what is left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he says:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let so many bulls be slain for the sacrifice;<br />
					let so many cows,<br />
					so many heifers,<br />
					so many goats,<br />
					so many rams,<br />
					(let so many horses)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					be slain for the sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let them cut down so many trees<br />
					for sacrificial posts;<br />
					let them mow so much kusa grass<br />
					for the sacrifice."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then whosoever are called his slaves,<br />
					messengers<br />
					or workmen,<br />
					scared by fear of the rod,<br />
					with tearful faces<br />
					set about their preparations.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a person<br />
					is a tormentor of both self and another<br />
					given to the practice of tormenting both self and others.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					a tormentor neither of self nor of another,<br />
					given neither to the practice of tormenting self<br />
					nor to that of tormenting others<br />
					<a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> he who torments neither self nor another<br />
					in this very life<br />
					no more hungry,<br />
					allayed,<br />
					become cool<br />
					one who has penetrated bliss,<br />
					he dwells with self that has become Brahma?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br />
					an Arahant,<br />
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and conduct,<br />
					a Wellfarer,<br />
					a world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed driver of men to be driven,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br />
					with its Devas,<br />
					its Maras,<br />
					its Brahmas,<br />
					with its host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					of devas and mankind,<br />
					himself having thoroughly understood<br />
					and realized it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches Dhamma<br />
					that is lovely in youth,<br />
					lovely in middle age,<br />
					lovely at the end of life,<br />
					both in the spirit<br />
					and the letter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes plain the God-life<br />
					entirely complete<br />
					and fully purified.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a housefather<br />
					or one of a household<br />
					or one born in some family or other<br />
					hears that Dhamma,<br />
					and so hearing<br />
					acquires faith in the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of this faith<br />
					so acquired<br />
					he thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">Oppressive is this household life,<br />
					a way of dust.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The way of going forth<br />
					is of the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy thing<br />
					for one living the household life<br />
					to practise the God-life<br />
					in all its completeness,<br />
					in utter purity<br />
					like a polished shell.</p>

					<p class="f4">How if I were to get my beard shorn and,<br />
					donning the saffron robe,<br />
					were to go forth from home<br />
					to the homeless?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he, some time later on,<br />
					abandoning the whole mass of his wealth<br />
					whether small or great,<br />
					abandoning his circle of kinsmen<br />
					whether small or great,<br />
					gets his beard shorn,<br />
					dons the saffron robes<br />
					and goes forth from home<br />
					to the homeless.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br />
					having entered upon the way of life<br />
					in the training followed by monks,<br />
					abandoning the slaying of creatures,<br />
					abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives as one<br />
					who has laid down the rod,<br />
					who has laid down the knife,<br />
					who has scruples,<br />
					is kind<br />
					and has compassion<br />
					for every living thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the taking of what is not given,<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives as one<br />
					who takes only what is given,<br />
					who waits for what is given,<br />
					he lives with a self<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that has become pure,<br />
					not <a id="pg222"><span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span></a> by stealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning the unchaste life<br />
					he lives chaste,<br />
					lives a life aloof,<br />
					abstaining from the sexual act,<br />
					from dealings with womenfolk.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning falsehood<br />
					he abstains therefrom,<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					joins truth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> to truth,<br />
					unswerving,<br />
					reliable,<br />
					no deceiver of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning slanderous speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at one place<br />
					he spreads it not abroad elsewhere<br />
					to cause dissension among these folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears something at another place<br />
					he spreads it not abroad elsewhere<br />
					to cause dissension among these folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he reconciles<br />
					those who are at variance<br />
					and confirms<br />
					the friendly.</p>

					<p class="f4">He delights in harmony,<br />
					finds pleasure herein,<br />
					rejoices in harmony<br />
					and utters words<br />
					that make for harmony.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning bitter speech<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever speech is blameless,<br />
					pleasing to the ear,<br />
					affectionate,<br />
					speech that goes to the heart,<br />
					is urbane,<br />
					delights many folk,<br />
					pleases many folk, -<br />
					such speech does he utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning idle babble<br />
					he abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is one who speaks in season,<br />
					speaks of facts,<br />
					speaks sense,<br />
					speaks according to Dhamma,<br />
					speaks according to Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">He speaks words worth treasuring up,<br />

					discriminating<br />

					lives on one meal a day,<br />

					from buying and selling,<br />
					sending messengers<br />
					<a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> or going as such,<br />

					from cheating<br />
					and crooked ways.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He abstains from cutting,<br />
					flogging,<br />
					binding,<br />
					highway robbery,<br />
					plundering<br />
					and deeds of violence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is content with a robe<br />
					sufficient to protect the body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with alms-food enough<br />
					for his belly's need.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherever he may go<br />
					he takes these with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, for instance,<br />
					a bird upon the wing,<br />
					wherever he may fly,<br />
					flies with the load of his wings, -<br />
					even so a monk is content with a robe<br />

					<p class="f4">Wherever he may go<br />

					<p class="f4">Possessed of this Ariyan mass of morals,<br />

					<p class="f4">Seeing an object with the eye<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />

					he purges his heart<br />
					of the taint of ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandoning sloth-and-torpor<br />

					wideawake,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span><br />
					mindful,<br />

					<p class="f4">Abandoning distraction-and-flurry<br />

					<p class="f4">Abandoning doubt-and-wavering,<br />
					he abides as one<br />
					who has transcended them;<br />
					no longer questioning this or that<br />
					in things profitable,<br />
					he purges his heart<br />
					of doubt-and-wavering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus abandoning these five hindrances,<br />
					these taints of the heart<br />
					which cause the weakening of wisdom,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span><br />
					aloof from sense-desires,<br />

					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained<br />
					he attains and abides in the second musing,<br />
					that inward calming,<br />
					that single-mindedness<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					he experiences with body<br />
					that ease<br />
					of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert,<br />
					dwells at ease,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both the happiness and unhappiness he had before,<br />
					he attains and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span>He then, with mind thus composed,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">In divers ways he recalls his former births, thus:</p>

							three, four, five,<br />
							ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br />
							a hundred,<br />
							a thousand,<br />
							a hundred thousand births:<br />
							the various destructions of aeons,<br />
							the various renewals of aeons,<br />
							both the destructions and renewals of eons, thus:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I lived there,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Thus he calls to mind<br />
							in all their specific details,<br />

							his previous states of existence.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">He then, with mind thus composed,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">With the deva-sight,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Or:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Thus with the deva-sight,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then with heart calmed and purified,<br />
					cleansed and flawless,<br />
					void of taints,<br />

					fixed and come to utter peace,<br />
					he bends down<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> his mind<br />
					to the knowledge of how to destroy the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know,<br />
					as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the arising of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know,<br />

					<p class="f4">"This is the ending of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know,<br />

					<p class="f4">"This is the practice going to the ending of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">He comcs to know as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the ending of āsavas."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the practice going to the ending of āsavas."</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus knowing,<br />
					thus seeing,<br />
					his heart is released from the <i>āsava</i> of sense-desire;<br />
					his heart is released from the <i>āsava</i> of becoming;<br />
					his heart is released from the <i>āsava</i> of ignorance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">By release comes the knowledge:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am released."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">Lived is the God-life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Done is what was to be done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no beyond to this state of things."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br />
					is neither a tormentor of self nor of another,<br />

					<p class="f4">He, being neither of these,<br />

					with a self that has become Brahma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span></p>
