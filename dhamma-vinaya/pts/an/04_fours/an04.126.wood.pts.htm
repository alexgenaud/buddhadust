<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 126. The Buddha describes four paths to the Pure Abodes based on the four devine lifestyles: friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment in combination with seeing that form, sense-experience, sense-perception, own-making, and sense-consciousness are changable, painful, a sickness, a boil, a dart, grief-ridden, an opression, another's, destined for destruction, empty, and not-self." />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person lives<br />

					third<br />

					and in like manner above,<br />
					below,<br />
					across,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					for all sorts and conditions,<br />
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br />
					with a heart possessed of amity<br />
					that is widespread,<br />
					grown great<br />
					and boundless,<br />
					free from enmity<br />
					and untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br />
