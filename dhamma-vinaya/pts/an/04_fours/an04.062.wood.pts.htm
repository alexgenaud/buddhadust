					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the housefather <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> came to visit the Exalted One,<br />

					from time to time<br />
					and when occasion offers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The bliss of ownership,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the bliss of wealth,<br />
					the bliss of debtlessness,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a> In this case a clansman has wealth<br />

					<p class="f4">This, housefather, is called<br />
					"the bliss of ownership."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, housefather,<br />
					a clansman by means of wealth<br />
					acquired by energetic striving,<br />
					amassed by strength of arm,<br />
					won by sweat,<br />
					lawful<br />

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of debtlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a clansman<br />
					owes no debt<br />
					great or small<br />
					to anyone.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">I owe no debt,<br />

					"the bliss of debtlessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the bliss of blamelessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, housefather,<br />
					the Ariyan disciple is blessed<br />
					with blameless action of body,<br />
					blameless action of speech,<br />
					blameless action of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am blessed<br />
					with blameless action of body,<br />
					with blameless action of speech<br />
					with blameless action of mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />

					<p class="f4">Such, housefather, are the four kinds of bliss<br />
