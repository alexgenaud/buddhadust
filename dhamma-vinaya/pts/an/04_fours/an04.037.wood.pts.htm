					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four qualities<br />
					a man is incapable of falling away;<br />
					he is near to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is perfect in virtue,<br />
					he is guarded as to the doors of the sense-facuities,<br />
					he is moderate in eating,<br />
					he is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way is a monk perfect in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is virtuous,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he dwells restrained with the restraint of the obligations:<br />
					perfect in the practice of right conduct<br />
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br />
					he takes up and <a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> trains himself<br />
					in the stages of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is perfect in virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk guarded<br />
					as to the doors of the sense-faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> a monk,<br />
					seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the eye,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he hears a sound with the ear,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the ear uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the ear,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he smells a scent with the nose,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the nose uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the nose,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he tastes a savour with the tongue,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the tongue uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the tongue,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he contacts tangibles with the body,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the body uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the body,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the mind he cognizes mental states<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection,<br />
					evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might flow in upon one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled,<br />
					be applies himself to such control,<br />
					he sets a guard over the faculty of the mind,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk has the doors of the sense-faculties guarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk takes his food<br />
					thoughtfully and prudently,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					not for sport,<br />
					not for indulgence,<br />
					not for personal charm or adornment,<br />
					but just enough for the support,<br />
					for the continuance of body,<br />
					for its resting unharmed,<br />
					to help the living of the God-life,<br />
					with this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br />
					and I set going no new feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus maintenance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> shall be mine,<br />
					blamelessness<br />
					and comfort in life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk given to watchfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">By day a monk walks up and down<br />
					and then sits,<br />
					thus cleansing his heart<br />
					of conditions that should be checked.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">By night for the first watch<br />
					he walks up and down<br />
					and then sits,<br />
					thus cleansing his heart<br />
					of conditions that should be checked.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br />
					lying on his right side<br />
					he takes up the lion <a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> posture,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					resting one foot on the other,<br />
					and thus collected and composed<br />
					fixes his thoughts on rising up again.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br />
					at early dawn,<br />
					he walks up and down,<br />
					then sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					of conditions that should be checked.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these four qualities<br />
					a monk is incapable of falling away:<br />
					he is near to Nibbāna.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Stablished in virtue, faculty-controlled,<br />
							Moderate in eating, given to watchfulness,<br />
							Thus dwelling day and night unwearied,<br />
							Making become good dhamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> for to win<br />
							Peace from the toil,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> in earnestness delighting,<br />
							In slackness seeing danger, - such a monk<br />
							Incapable of failure nears the Goal.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
