<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Sutta 105. The Buddha compares four sorts of persons to the conditions of four pools of water: one that is shallow but looks deep, one that is deep but looks shallow, one that is shallow and looks shallow, and one that is deep and looks deep. This sutta is a twist on the use of the two sets of terms. Here deepness is a matter of understanding the Four Truths or not, appearing deep or not is a matter of having charming comportment or not." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four pools of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The shallow which looks deep,<br />
					the deep which looks shallow,<br />
					the shallow which looks shallow,<br />
					and the deep which looks deep.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four pools of water.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, there are these four persons resembling pools of water to be found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The shallow which looks deep,<br />
					the deep which looks shallow,<br />
					the shallow which looks shallow,<br />
					and the deep which looks deep.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person shallow but look deep?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the mien of a certain person<br />
					is charming,<br />
					whether he be departing or approaching,<br />
					looking forward or backward,<br />
					bending or unbending (his arm),<br />
					or bearing outer robe,<br />
					bowl<br />
					and (ordinary) robe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person<br />
					is shallow but looks deep.</p>

					<p class="f4">As is that pool of water is shallow but looks deep,<br />
					even so using this figure<br />
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person deep and looks deep.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that pool of water is deep and looks deep,<br />
					even so using this figure<br />
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
