					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Potaliya the Wanderer came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having greeted him courteously he took a seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> sat at one side the Exalted One said this to Potaliya the Wanderer:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Potaliya, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Potaliya, a certain person<br />
					speaks in dispraise<br />
					of what deserves dispraise,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true;<br />
					but does not speak in praise<br />
					of what deserves praise<br />
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Potaliya, a certain person<br />
					speaks in praise<br />
					of what deserves praise<br />
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true,<br />
					but speaks not in dispraise<br />
					of what deserves dispraise,<br />
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, Potaliya, a certain person<br />
					speaks neither in dispraise<br />
					of what deserves dispraise,<br />
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true,<br />
					nor speaks in praise<br />
					of the praiseworthy,<br />
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, Potaliya, a certain person<br />
					speaks both in dispraise<br />
					of what deserves dispraise<br />
					seasonably saying what is a fact and true<br />
					and in praise<br />
					of what is praiseworthy,<br />
					saying seasonably what is a fact and true.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Potaliya, are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Potaliya, of these four,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, master Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now, Potaliya, there are these four persons found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Potaliya,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well, master Gotama, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, master Gotama, his discrimination of proper occasions is admirable.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, master Gotama,<br />

					or show forth the hidden,<br />
					or point the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects,-<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama accept me as a lay-disciple<br />
					from this time forth,<br />
					as long as life may last,<br />
					as one who has gone to him for refuge.'</p>
