					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as a disease,<br />
					as an imposthume,<br />
					as a barb,<br />
					as pain,<br />
					ill-health,<br />
					alien,<br />
					transitory,<br />
					as empty<br />
					and not of the self.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br />
					he is reobrn in the company<br />
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					enters upon the second musing,<br />
					that calming of the inner self,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as a disease,<br />
					as an imposthume,<br />
					as a barb,<br />
					as pain,<br />
					ill-health,<br />
					alien,<br />
					transitory,<br />
					as empty<br />
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br />
					he is reobrn in the company<br />
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					experiences in his own person<br />
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br />
					"He who is disinterested and alert<br />
					dwells at ease,"<br />
					— thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as a disease,<br />
					as an imposthume,<br />
					as a barb,<br />
					as pain,<br />
					ill-health,<br />
					alien,<br />
					transitory,<br />
					as empty<br />
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br />
					he is reobrn in the company<br />
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, a certain person here,<br />
					by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br />
					attains the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, whatsoever conditions arise by way of form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the activities,<br />
					consciousness,<br />
					those conditions he comes to regard as impermanent,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as a disease,<br />
					as an imposthume,<br />
					as a barb,<br />
					as pain,<br />
					ill-health,<br />
					alien,<br />
					transitory,<br />
					as empty<br />
					and not of the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up after death<br />
					he is reobrn in the company<br />
					of the devas of the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, this rebirth is not partaken of by ordinary men.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these four persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
