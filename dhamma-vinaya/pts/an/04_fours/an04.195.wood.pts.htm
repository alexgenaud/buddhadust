					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Sakyans at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a>, in Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time Vappa the Sakyan,<br />
					a disciple of the Unclothed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> went to visit Moggallāna the Great,<br />
					and on coming to him,<br />
					saluted the venerable Moggallāna the Great<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus,<br />
					the venerable Moggallāna the Great was saying this<br />
					to Vappa the Sakyan,<br />
					disciple of the Unclothed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There may be someone here, Vappa,<br />
					restrained in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br />
					and the arising of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any cause<br />
					owing to which the <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain<br />
					would flow in upon<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the man at some future time?'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sir, I do see such a reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be in this case<br />
					a certain previously done evil deed,<br />
					whose fruit has not yet ripened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that the <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain might flow in upon that man at some future time.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> At this juncture the conversation which the two were holding was broken off.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					at eventide rising from his solitary meditating,<br />
					went towards the service-hall,<br />
					and on reaching it sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having taken his seat the Exalted One said this to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, Moggallāna, on what subject are you talking as you sit here now,<br />
					and what was the talk just interrupted?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, I was just saying to Vappa the Sakyan,<br />
					disciple of the Unclothed,</p>

					<p class="f4">"There may be someone here, Vappa,<br />
					restrained in body, speech and thought,<br />
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br />
					and the arising of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any cause owing to which the <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					would flow in upon the man at some future time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words, lord, Vappa was saying to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, I do see such a reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">There may be in this case a certain previously done evil deed<br />
					whose fruit has not yet ripened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to that the <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					might flow in upon that man at some future time."</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the subject we were engaged upon;<br />
					then the talk was interrupted by the arrival of the Exalted One.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Exalted One to Vappa the Sakyan,<br />
					disciple of the Unclothed:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If you, Vappa,<br />
					would allow what you deem allowable,<br />
					and reject what you deem should be rejected,<br />
					and in case you should not understand the meaning of my words,<br />
					if you would question me still further thus:<br />
					"How is this, sir?<br />
					What is the meaning of that?"<br />
					- we might have a talk here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will indeed, lord,<br />
					allow the Exalted One what I deem allowable<br />
					and will reject what I deem should be rejected,<br />
					and in case I do not understand the Exalted One's words<br />
					I will question the Exalted One still further, thus:<br />
					"What is this, lord?<br />
					What is the meaning of that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So be it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let us have a talk here.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what think you, Vappa?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to these <i>āsavas</i> which come about as a result of bodily activities,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the case of one who abstains from bodily activities that cause vexation and <a id="pg209"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span></a> distress,<br />
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br />
					as to his former deed,<br />
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by a wearing out<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is plain to see,<br />
					not just for a time;<br />
					one that asks for inspection,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br />
					each for himself.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now again, Vappa, what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> that come about as the result of activities of speech<br />
					in the case of one who abstains from activities of speech that cause vexation and distress,<br />
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br />
					as to his former deed,<br />
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br />
					by a wearing out<br />
					that is plain to see,<br />
					not just for a time;<br />
					one that asks for inspection,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br />
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now again, Vappa, what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> that come about as the result of activities of mind,<br />
					in the case of one who abstains from activities of mind that cause vexation and distress,<br />
					it follows that those <i><i>āsavas</i></i> causing pain do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br />
					as to his former deed,<br />
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br />
					by a wearing out<br />
					that is plain to see,<br />
					not just for a time;<br />
					one that asks for inspection,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent,<br />
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again what think you, Vappa?</p>

					<p class="f4">As to those <i>āsavas</i> causing vexation and distress which result from ignorance, -<br />
					owing to the waning of ignorance<br />
					and the arising of knowledge<br />
					it follows that those <i>āsavas</i> of vexation and distress<br />
					do not exist in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does no fresh deed;<br />
					as to his former deed,<br />
					he wears it out by constant contact with it,<br />
					by a wearing out that is plain to see,<br />
					not just for a time;<br />
					one that asks for inspection,<br />
					that leads onward,<br />
					a wearing out that can be understood by the intelligent each for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Vappa, do you see any reason why <i>āsavas</i> causing pain<br />
					should flow in upon him at some future time?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, lord, that cannot be.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'So then, Vappa, by the monk whose heart is perfectly <a id="pg210"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span></a> released<br />
					six constant abiding-states<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> are attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the nose,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body contacting tangibles,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling limited by body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he knows that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br />
					after life is used up,<br />
					all my experiences in this world<br />
					will lose their lure and grow cold.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Vappa, that a shadow is cast by a stump.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes a man with axe and basket<br />
					and cuts down that stump by the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">So doing he digs all round it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so he pulls up the roots,<br />
					even the rootlets and root-fibres.</p>

					<p class="f4">He chops that stump into logs,<br />
					and having done so chops the log into chips.</p>

					<p class="f4">The chips he dries in wind and sun,<br />
					then burns them with fire,<br />
					then makes an ash-heap.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ash-heap he winnows in a strong wind<br />
					or lets the ash be carried away by a swiftly flowing river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily, Vappa, that shadow cast because of the stump<br />
					is cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made not to become again,<br />
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Vappa,<br />
					by a monk whose heart is thus released<br />
					six constant abiding-places are won.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing a sound with the ear,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smelling a scent with the nose,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tasting a savour with the tongue,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With body contacting tangibles,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">With mind cognizing mental states,<br />
					is neither elated nor depressed,<br />
					but rests indifferent,<br />
					mindful and comprehending.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he feels a feeling limited <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> by body,<br />
					he knows that he so feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows:</p>

					<p class="f4">When body breaks up,<br />
					after life is used up,<br />
					all my experiences in this world<br />
					will lose their lure and grow cold.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Vappa, the Sakyan,<br />
					disciple of the Unclothed,<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, just like a man desirous of wealth<br />
					who tends his property<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but gets no increase therefrom,<br />
					but instead gets toil and trouble for his pains,<br />
					even so, lord, did I,<br />
					desirous of profit,<br />
					do service unto the Unclothed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I got no profit thereby,<br />
					but instead got toil and trouble for my pains.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, lord, from this day forth,<br />
					whatever faith I had in those fools the Unclothed, -<br />
					I winnow it away in a strong wind,<br />
					or I let it be carried away by a swiftly flowing river.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, master Gotama,<br />
					one should raise the fallen<br />
					or show forth the hidden,<br />
					or point the way to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have yes may behold objects, —<br />
					even so in divers ways has dhamma been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as his follower from this time forth<br />
					so long as life shall last,<br />
					as one who has gone to him for refuge.'</p>
