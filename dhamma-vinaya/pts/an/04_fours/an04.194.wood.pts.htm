					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#koliya">Koliyans,</a> -<br />
					there is a place called Sāpūga, -<br />
					in a township of the Koliyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great number of the Sāpūgyans of the Koliyan clan<br />
					came to visit the venerable Ānanda,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg205"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span></a> As they sat thus<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br />
					to the Koliyans of Sāpūga:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Men of the Leopard's Path,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					these four factors of exertion<br />
					for utter purification<br />
					have been fully proclaimed<br />
					by that Exalted One who knows,<br />
					who sees,<br />
					that Arahant,<br />
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					for the purification of beings,<br />
					for the passing over grief and distress,<br />
					for the making an end<br />
					of sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					for the winning of the Method,<br />
					for the realization of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of morals,<br />
					the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purity of thought,<br />
					the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purity of view,<br />
					and the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purity of release.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, Men of the Leopard's Path,<br />
					is the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of morals?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is virtuous,<br />
					he undertakes and practises the precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"utter purification of morals." </p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br />
					"I will bring to perfection<br />

					I will supplement it here and there<br />
					by wisdom,"<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">the desire to do,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, men of the Leopard's Path,<br />
					is the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br />
					aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg206"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span></a> Then by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained<br />
					he attains and abides in the second musing,<br />
					that inward calming,<br />
					that single-mindedness<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					he experiences with body<br />
					that ease<br />
					of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert,<br />
					dwells at ease,"</p>

					<p class="f4">and he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both the happiness and unhappiness he had before,<br />
					he attains and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the utter purification of thought."</p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br />
					"I will bring to perfection<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, men of the Leopard's Path,<br />
					is the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of view?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk comes to understand,<br />
					as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">comes to understand,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">comes to understand,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the practice going to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"utter purification of view "</p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br />
					"I will bring to perfection<br />
					such a purification of view<br />
					if it be incomplete,<br />
					and if complete<br />
					I will supplement it here and there<br />
					by wisdom,</p>

					<p class="f4">the desire to do,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, men of the Leopard's Path,<br />
					is the factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of release?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the Ariyan disciple<br />
					who is possessed of this factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of morals<br />
					for the utter purification of thought<br />
					for the utter purification of of view,<br />
					cleanses his heart of conditions that defile,<br />
					he releases<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> his heart<br />
					by means of conditions that release.</p>

					<p class="f4">So doing he attains perfection of release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the utter purification of release."</p>

					<p class="f4">(the resolve):<br />
					I <a id="pg207"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span></a> will bring to perfection<br />
					such a purification of release<br />
					if it be incomplete,<br />
					and if complete<br />
					I will supplement it here and there<br />
					by wisdom,</p>

					<p class="f4">the desire to do,<br />
					the effort,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					endeavour,<br />
					persistence,<br />
					mindfulness<br />
					and attention applied thereto<br />
					is called<br />
					"a factor of exertion<br />
					for the utter purification of release."</p>

					<p class="f4">So, men of the Leopard's Path,<br />
					these are the four factors of exertion<br />
					for utter purification<br />
					which were fully proclaimed<br />
					by that Exalted One<br />
					who knows,<br />
					who sees,<br />
					the Arahant,<br />
					the Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					for the purification of beings,<br />
