<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 169. The Buddha distinguishes between two sorts of persons in accordance with their path: one pair meditates on the foul and one pair uses the jhanas. Of each pair one attains extinguishment here and one hereafter. In the case of the first pair, meditating on the foul, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes after own-making (sankhara). In the case of the second pair, using the jhanas, extinguishment either here or hereafter comes without own-making."/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />
					in this very life is set free,<br />
					but with some effort.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, <a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br />
					is set free<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					but without effort.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br />
					one who in this very life is set free,<br />
					but with some effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br />
					aware of the repulsiveness of food,<br />
					aware of his distaste for all the world,<br />
					aware of impermanence in all the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus awareness of death<br />
					is well implanted in the very self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br />
					on these five powers of a pupil,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the power of faith,<br />
					the power of modesty,<br />
					the power of self-restraint,<br />
					the power of energy,<br />
					the power of power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him these five controlling faculties<br />
					are manifested in abundance,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, by the preponderance of these five controlling faculties<br />
					in this very life, he is set free,<br />
					but with some effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person<br />
					set free when body breaks up,<br />
					but with some effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk lives contemplating the unloveliness in body,<br />
					aware of the repulsiveness of food,<br />
					aware of his distaste for all the world,<br />
					aware of impermanence in all the activities.</p>

					the power of modesty,<br />
					the power of self-restraint,<br />

					<p class="f4">In him these five controlling faculties<br />
					are dully manifested,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br />
					the controlling faculty of energy,<br />
					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					the controlling faculty of concentration,<br />
					the controlling faculty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, by the dullness of these faculties,<br />
					he is set free<br />
					with some effort<br />
					when body breaks up.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person set free<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					but without effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a monk,<br />
					aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the calming down<br />
					of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					enters upon the second musing,<br />
					that calming of the inner self,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					experiences in his own person<br />
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He who is disinterested and alert dwells at ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">So he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br />
					he attains the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives dependent<br />
					on these five powers of a pupil:<br />
					the power of faith,<br />
					the power of modesty,<br />
					that of self-restraint,<br />
					that of energy,<br />
					and the power of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">But in him these five <a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a>  controlling faculties<br />
					are dully manifested,<br />
					to wit:<br />
					the controlling faculty of faith,<br />

					the controlling faculty of mindfulness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Owing to the dullness of these five faculties,<br />
					it is not till body breaks up<br />
					that he is set free without effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Sa-saṅkhāra-parinibbāyī.</i> At <i>Dial.</i> iii, 227, 'with some toil.' At <i>PuggA.</i> on <i>Pugg.</i> 17 expl. as <i>dukkhena, kasirena, adhimatta-payogaṃ hatvā</i> (with considerable effort). But at <i>Buddh. Psych. Ethics,</i> § 146, <i>n.</i> 1, explained as instigated. Generally, we may see that mediacy, absence of immediacy is meant. <i>Cf.</i> <i>K.S.</i> v, 57; <i>Expos.</i> i, 207: 'the import is <i>with external plan, effort, instigation, expedient, totality of causes.</i>' <i>Comy.</i> on <i>S.</i> v <i>loc. cit.</i> has <i>sappayogena</i> as at <i>VM.</i> ii, 710, where Prof. Mating Tin trans. (<i>Path of Purity,</i> iii, 874): 'Enters complete nirvana with external instigation.'<br />
					As to <i>parinibbāyin,</i> <i>SA.</i> i, 20, 37 defs. 'gone out by the going out of the impurities.' <i>Comy.</i> on our text expands the textual explanation, saying that these grades are a matter of strength of the controlling faculties, but does not explain <i>parinibbāyin.</i></p>
