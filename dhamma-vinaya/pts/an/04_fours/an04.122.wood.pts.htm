<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 122. The Buddha describes four fearful challenges that face the newly ordained bhikkhu who has gone forth in faith: the need to overcome anger at being instructed in proper forms of behavior for a bhikkhu; the need to overcome desire to indulge the appatite for food in ways that are not suitable for a beggar, the need to over come envy of householders enjoying the pleasure of the senses; and the need to overcome lust on the sight of attractive members of the opposite sex." />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/04_fours/an04.122.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four perils to be looked for<br />
					in him who goes down to the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br />
					peril of crocodiles,<br />
					peril of whirlpools,<br />
					and peril of sea-monsters.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four perils.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, in some clansman here<br />
					who has gone forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless life<br />
					under this Dhamma-discipline<br />
					these four perils may be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Peril of waves,<br />
					peril of crocodiles,<br />
					peril of whirlpools<br />
					and peril of sea-monsters.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is peril of waves?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain clansman<br />
					who has in faith gone forth<br />
					from home to the homeless life,<br />
					thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I, launched upon birth,<br />
					old age<br />
					and death,<br />
					on sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					launched upon Ill,<br />
					overwhelmed by Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br />
					some ending may be shown.</p>

					<p class="f4">To such an one who has thus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> gone forth<br />
					his fellows in the God-life preach,<br />
					and admonish him,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus should you retreat,<br />
					thus advance;<br />
					thus should you look forward<br />
					and backward,<br />
					bend or unbend (your arm);<br />
					thus should you bear outer robe<br />
					and bowl<br />
					and inner robe.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I who aforetime lived at home<br />
					was wont to preach to<br />
					and admonish others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet these people,<br />
					who are to my thinking<br />
					no more than sons or grandsons,-<br />
					these people think that I am one to be preached to<br />
					and admonished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he, angered and offended,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a monk who abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life,<br />
					scared by the peril of waves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of the waves,' monks,<br />
					is a term for wrath and resentment.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'peril of waves.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> And of what sort, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">He thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">To such an one<br />
					who has thus gone forth<br />
					his fellows in the God-life<br />
					preach and admonish him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You should eat this,<br />
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should swallow<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> this,<br />
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should taste this,<br />
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should drink this,<br />
					not that.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat,<br />

					and drink<br />
					what is fitting,<br />
					not what is unfitting.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat,<br />
					swallow,<br />
					taste<br />
					and drink<br />
					at the proper,<br />
					not at the improper time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I who aforetime lived at home<br />
					used to eat,<br />
					swallow,<br />
					taste<br />
					and drink<br />
					just what I liked,<br />
					and refused to eat,<br />
					swallow,<br />
					taste<br />
					and drink<br />
					what I did not like.</p>

					<p class="f4">I used to eat,<br />
					swallow,<br />
					taste<br />
					and drink<br />
					both what was fitting<br />
					and unfitting,<br />
					and that too<br />
					whether the time was proper<br />
					or improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now<br />
					when believing householders offer me choice food<br />
					both hard and soft<br />
					at an improper time,<br />
					methinks they are putting a bridle<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> on my mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a monk who abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life<br />
					because he is scared by the peril of crocodiles.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of crocodiles,' monks,<br />
					is a term for gluttony.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'peril of crocodiles.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain clansman<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />

					launched upon Ill,<br />

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br />
					some ending may be shown.</p>

					<p class="f4">He having thus gone forth,<br />
					robing himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					sets out for village or township<br />
					to beg an alms,<br />
					with body unguarded,<br />
					with speech unguarded,<br />
					with thoughts unguarded,<br />
					with mind- <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> fullness not established,<br />
					with faculties uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he sees a housefather<br />
					or son of a housefather<br />
					indulging in,<br />
					provided with<br />
					and practising the five sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks thus:</p>

					when living at home<br />
					indulged in,<br />
					was provided with<br />

					<p class="f4">Moreover<br />
					since wealth exists in my family,<br />
					I could enjoy it<br />
					and do good works therewith.</p>

					<p class="f4">How now if I were to abandon the training,<br />
					turn back to the low life,<br />
					enjoy my wealth<br />
					and do good deeds therewith?</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he abandons the training,<br />
					turna back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a monk who abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life<br />
					because he is scared by the peril of whirlpools.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Peril of whirlpools,' monks,<br />
					is a term for the five sense-pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'peril of whirlpools.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the peril of sea-monsters?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain clansman<br />
					who has in faith gone forth<br />
					from the home to the homeless life<br />
					thinks thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here am I launched upon birth,<br />
					old age and death,<br />
					on sorrow and grief,<br />
					woe,<br />
					lamentation<br />
					and despair,<br />
					launched upon Ill,<br />
					overwhelmed by Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe of all this mass of Ill<br />
					some ending may be shown.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, having thus gone forth,<br />
					robes himself in the forenoon<br />
					and taking bowl and robe,<br />
					sets out for village or township<br />
					to beg an alms,<br />
					with body unguarded,<br />
					with speech unguarded,<br />
					with thoughts unguarded,<br />
					with mindfulness not established,<br />
					with faculties uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he sees womenfolk<br />
					partly clothed,<br />
					partly attired.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing that sight<br />
					passion assails<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart assailed by passion<br />
					he abandons the training<br />
					and turns back to the low life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a monk who, scared by the peril of sea-monsters,<br />
					abandons the training<br />

					<p class="f4">'Peril of sea-monsters,'<br />
					monks, is a term for womenfolk.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					'peril of sea-monsters.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four perils<br />
					to be looked for in some clansman here<br />
					who has rightly gone forth from home<br />
					to the homeless life under this Dhamma-discipline.'</p>
