							<p>This doesn't make sense. It is <i>sugata-vinayo</i> so it is discipline, so the following description should not be 'He is one' but 'It is such'. It is one in which the Dhamma is taught, lovely in the beginning ... per his usual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, these four things conduce to the confusion,<br />

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">So the generation that follows<br />

					<p class="f4">That generation also lives not in abundance<br />
					they are not lax,<br />
					they take not the lead in backsliding (to the worldly life),<br />
