					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of four things<br />
					a man is to be understood<br />
					as being unworthy.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the unworthy man,<br />

					speaks out what is discreditable to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">What then (would he say) if asked?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, he is obliged to speak<br />
					on being questioned,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, the unworthy one,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, however, he is obliged to speak<br />
