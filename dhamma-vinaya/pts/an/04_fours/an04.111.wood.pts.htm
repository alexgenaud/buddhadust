					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Kesi the horse-trainer came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him he saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to Kesi the horse-trainer:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You yourself, Kesi, are a trained man,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a trainer of horses for driving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Kesi, pray how do you train<br />
					a tameable horse?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As for me, your honour,<br />
					I train a tameable horse by mildness,<br />
					also by harshness,<br />
					also by both mildness and harshness."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But suppose, Kesi, a tameable horse<br />
					does not submit to your training by mildness<br />
					nor to the training by harshness<br />
					nor yet to the training by both methods,<br />
					what do you do?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"In such a case, your honour,<br />
					I destroy him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">With the idea:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let him not be a discredit to my teacher's clan.'</p>

					<p class="f4">However, your honour, the Exalted One is unsurpassed<br />
					as a trainer of men for driving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, your honour,<br />
					how does the Exalted One train a tameable man?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For my part, Kesi,<br />
					I too train a tameable man by mild- <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> ness,<br />
					also by harshness,<br />
					also by both together.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Kesi, is the way by mildness:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in body;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in speech;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in thought;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus are devas and thus are men.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this, Kesi, is the way by harshness:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in body;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in speech;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in thought;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is rebirth as an animal;<br />
					thus is the realm of petas.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this, Kesi, is the way<br />
					by both mildness and harshness:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in body;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in body;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in speech;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in speech;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is good conduct in thought;<br />
					thus is the result of good conduct in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is bad conduct in thought;<br />
					thus is the result of bad conduct in thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus are devas and thus are men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is rebirth as an animal;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>||<br />
					thus is the realm of petas.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, your honour, if the man for training<br />
					won't submit to the training by mildness,<br />
					by harshness,<br />
					nor to the two together,<br />
					pray what does the Exalted One do?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In such case, Kesi, I destroy him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But surely the Exalted One does not take life!</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet the Exalted One spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I destroy him, Kesi!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"True it is, Kesi, that taking life does not become a Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet if the man to be trained<br />
					submits not to the training by mildness,<br />
					by harshness<br />
					or both together,<br />
					then the Tathāgata thinks it not worth while<br />
					to admonish that man,<br />
					nor do his wise fellows in the God-life<br />
					think it worth while<br />
					to admonish that man.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Kesi, is destruction for a man in the discipline of the Ariyan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					when both the Tathāgata and his fellows in the God-life think it not worth while to admonish him."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed indeed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> your honour,<br />
					is a man by the Wellfarer,<br />
					<a id="pg118"><span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></a> when both the Tathāgata and his fellows in the God-life<br />
					think it not worth while to admonish him!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, your honour!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as a follower from this time forth,<br />
					so long as life lasts,<br />
					as one who has taken refuge with him.'</p>
