					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four floods of merit,<br />
					floods of things profitable,<br />
					bringing happiness,<br />
					giving the best things,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					whose fruit is happiness,<br />
					leading to the heaven world,<br />
					leading to what is dear,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and pleasant,<br />
					to profit<br />
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of the robe,<br />
					using which<br />
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration <a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> of mind,<br />
					to him comes a flood of merit,<br />
					a flood of things profitable,<br />

					whose fruit is happiness,<br />
					leading to the heaven world,<br />
					leading to what is dear,<br />
					delightful<br />
					and pleasant,<br />
					to profit<br />
					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of alms-food,<br />
					using which<br />
					a monk is able to attain and abide in unbounded concentration of mind,<br />

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of lodging,<br />

					<p class="f4">To him, monks, who is the giver of requisites and medicines for use in sickness,<br />

					and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, if an Ariyan disciple be possessed of these four floods of merit,<br />
					floods of things profitable,<br />
					it is no easy thing to take the measure of his merit, (so as to say): -</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such and such is the extent<br />
					of the flood of merit,<br />

					<p class="f4">nay, it is to be reckoned as an incalculable,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, it is no easy thing to take the measure of the water<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in the mighty ocean, (so as to say): -</p>

					<p class="f4">"So many gallons of water,<br />

							Flow broadly down and to that ocean come;<br />
