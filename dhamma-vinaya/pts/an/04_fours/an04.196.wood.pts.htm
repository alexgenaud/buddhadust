					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in Great Wood,<br />
					at Peak-roofed House.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now Saḷha the Licchavī<br />
					and Abhaya the Licchavī<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated Saḷha the Licchavī said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are some recluses and brahmins, lord,<br />
					who proclaim a twofold crossing of the flood,<br />
					namely,<br />
					the way made by purity of morals<br />
					and that made by self-mortification.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What says the Exalted One about this, lord?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do indeed say, Saḷha,<br />
					that purity of morals<br />
					is a factor of recluseship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who uphold self-mortification,<br />
					who make self-mortification essential,<br />
					who remain clinging to self-mortification, -<br />
					they are incapable of crossing the flood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Saḷha, those recluses and <a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a> brahmins<br />
					who practise impurity of body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought,<br />
					who live in impurity, -<br />
					they are incapable of knowledge and insight,<br />
					of the enlightenment that is unsurpassed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a man, Saḷha, desirous of crossing a river,<br />
					takes a sharp axe and enters the jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a mighty sal-tree,<br />
					straight up,<br />
					young,<br />
					not of crooked growth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He cuts it down at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />
					he lops it at the top,<br />
					and having lopped it at the top<br />
					clears off branches and twigs<br />
					and makes it clean.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />
					he chips it roughly with axes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having chipped it with axes<br />
					he does so with knives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done that<br />
					he smooths it with a scraper.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">After that he smooths it with rock-ball<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and then brings it down to the river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Saḷha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is that man capable of crossing the river?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not so, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, lord, that sal-tree log,<br />
					though well worked outside,<br />
					is not cleaned out inside.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is to be expected of it, -<br />
					the log will sink,<br />
					the man comes to misfortune and destruction.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Saḷha, just in the same way<br />
					those recluses and brahmins who uphold self-mortification,<br />
					who make self-mortification essential,<br />
					who cling to self-mortification,<br />
					are incapable of crossing the flood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Saḷha, those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who practise impurity of body,<br />
					speech<br />

					of the enlightenment which is unsurpassed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But on the other hand those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who do not uphold selfmortification,<br />
					who do not make self-mortification essential,<br />
					who do not cling to self-mortification,<br />
					<a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> are capable of crossing the flood.</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose a man, Saḷha, desirous of crossing a river<br />
					takes a sharp axe and enters the jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a mighty sal-tree trunk,<br />
					straight up,<br />
					young,<br />
					not of crooked growth.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cuts it down at the root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />
					he chips it roughly with axes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having chipped it with axes<br />
					he does so with knives.</p>

					<p class="f4">After chipping it with knives<br />
					he takes a chisel and cleans out the inside<br />
					till it is thoroughly hollowed out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he takes a scraper<br />
					and scrapes it<br />
					and smooths it with rock-ball.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wñen he has done this<br />
					he makes a boat of it,<br />
					fastens on oars and rudder<br />
					and finally brings down the boat to the river.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, Saḷha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is that man capable of crossing the river?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, he is, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is the cause of that?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why, lord, that sal-tree log<br />
					is well worked outside<br />
					and thoroughly cleaned out inside,<br />
					made into a boat<br />
					and fitted with oars and rudder. </p>

					<p class="f4">This is to be expected of it:<br />
					the boat will not sink<br />
					and the man will reach the shore in safety.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Saḷha, just in the same way<br />
