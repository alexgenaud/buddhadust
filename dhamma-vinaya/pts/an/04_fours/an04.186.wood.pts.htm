					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain monk came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br />
					that monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, lord, by what is the world led?</p>

					<p class="f4">By what is the world drawn along?</p>

					<p class="f4">Under the sway of what that has arisen<br />
					does it go?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well, said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					happy is your ready wit<br />
					and goodly is your <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> questioning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your question is thus, is it not, monk?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, by what is the world led?</p>

					<p class="f4">By what is the world drawn along?</p>

					<p class="f4">Under the sway of what that has arisen does it go?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, monk, the world is led by thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">By thought it is drawn along.</p>

					<p class="f4">When thought has arisen, it goes under its sway.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br />
					replied that monk,<br />
					welcoming what was said by the Exalted One,<br />
					and after thanking him<br />
					asked another question:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to the common saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Widely learned,<br />
					one who knows Dhamma by heart" -</p>

					<p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort<br />
					is one widely learned,<br />
					who knows Dhamma by heart?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br />
					happy is your ready wit<br />
					and goodly is your questioning.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort<br />
					is one widely learned,<br />
					who knows Dhamma by heart?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, monk, I have taught Dhamma widely, -<br />
					<i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākarana, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhu-tadhamma</i> and <i>Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now if a monk understands<br />
					the meaning and (text of) Dhamma, -<br />
					even if it be but a stanza of four lines,-<br />
					and be set on living in accordance with Dhamma,<br />
					he may well be called</p>

					<p class="f4">"One widely learned,<br />
					who knows Dhamma by heart."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br />
					replied that monk,<br />
					welcoming what <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> was said by the Exalted One,<br />
					and after thanking him<br />
					asked another question:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to the common saying, lord,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Learned, of penetrative wisdom" -</p>

					<p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort is one learned, of penetrative wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br />
					happy is your ready wit<br />
					and goodly is your questioning.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort is one learned,<br />
					of penetrative wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this case, monk, a monk hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br />
					and sees that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the arising of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br />
					and sees that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the ending of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br />
					and sees that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the practice going to the ending of Ill."</p>

					<p class="f4">By wisdom he penetrates the meaning of that saying<br />
					and sees that it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monk, he is learned,<br />
					of penetrative wisdom.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is well said, lord,'<br />
					replied that monk,<br />
					welcoming what was said by the Exalted One,<br />
					and after thanking him<br />
					asked another question:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'As to the common saying</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wise, of great wisdom,"</p>

					<p class="f4">pray, lord, of what sort is one who is wise,<br />
					of great wisdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well said!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well said, monk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Happy is your approach to a question,<br />
					happy is your ready wit<br />
					and goodly is your questioning.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ask this, do you not?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pray, lord, of what sort is one who is wise,<br />
					of great wisdom?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, monk, in this case<br />
					he who is wise,<br />
					of great wisdom,<br />
					thinks not with a view to harm<br />
					either himself<br />
					or another<br />
					or both alike.</p>

					<p class="f4">So thinking<br />
					he thinks with a view<br />
					to the profit of self,<br />
					of another,<br />
					both of self and of another,<br />
					to the profit of the whole world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monk, one is wise,<br />
					of great wisdom.'</p>
