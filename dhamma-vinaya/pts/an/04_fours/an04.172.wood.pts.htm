<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 172. The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of kamma of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Hearing this exposition, Sāriputta explains the details of how this works for the self-instigated action that results in rebirth, the other-instigated action that results in rebirth, the both self and other-instigated action that results in rebirth and asks the Buddha for an explanation of how there can be rebirth or not in the case where there is neither self-instigation nor other instigation. Gotama explains."/>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four ways of getting personality.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, monks, the getting of personality<br />
					in the getting of which<br />
					one's own intention,<br />
					not that of another person,<br />
					has effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in the getting of which<br />
					another person's intention<br />
					has effect,<br />
					not one's own.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in which both one's own<br />
					and another's intention<br />
					have effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is that in which neither<br />
					has effect.</p>

					<p class="f4">These make four."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					the venerable Sāriputta said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of this, lord, that has been uttered by the Exalted One in brief<br />
					I understand the meaning in detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br />
					in which one's own intention,<br />
					not another's,<br />
					has effect,<br />
					there is decease for those beings<br />
					from that group<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					because of one's own intention.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br />
					in which another's intention,<br />
					not one's own,<br />
					has effect,<br />
					there is decease for those beings<br />
					from that group<br />
					because of another's intention.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the case where there is getting of personality<br />
					in which both have effect,<br />
					there is decease for those beings<br />
					from that group<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					because of the intention<br />
					both of oneself<br />
					and of another.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, lord, in the case<br />
					where there is getting of personality<br />
					in <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> which neither has effect,<br />
					what sort of devas are to be regarded therein?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Sāriputta,<br />
					it is the devas who have attained the realm<br />
					in which is neither-perception-nor-non-perception.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Pray, lord, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why certain beings<br />
					deceasing from that group<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are Returners,<br />
					who come back to this state of things?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Again, lord, what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why certain beings<br />
					deceasing from that group<br />
					are Non-returners,<br />
					who come not back to this state of things?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this (first) case, Sāriputta,<br />
					in a certain person<br />
					the fetters that bind to this world<br />
					are not abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one<br />
					in this very life<br />
					attains the realm where there is neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it,<br />
					finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein,<br />
					not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in that company.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he deceases thence<br />
					he is a Returner,<br />
					he comes back to this state of things.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In the other case, Sāriputta,<br />
					in a certain person<br />
					the fetters that bind to this world<br />
					are abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one<br />
					in this very life<br />
					attains the realm where is neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys its sweetness,<br />
					longs for it,<br />
					finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />

					when he makes an end he is reborn<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> in that company,<br />
					but deceasing thence<br />
					he is a Non-returner,<br />
					he comes not back to this state of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the reason,<br />
