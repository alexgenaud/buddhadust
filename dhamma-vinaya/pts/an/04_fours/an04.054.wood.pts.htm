					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four ways<br />
					of living together.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A vile man<br />
					lives along with a vile woman;<br />
					a vile man<br />
					lives along with a devi;<br />
					a deva<br />
					lives along with a vile woman;<br />
					a deva<br />
					lives along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, monks,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a vile woman?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks,<br />
					a husband is one who takes life,<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					of perverted view,<br />
					he is a wicked man,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					he lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					he abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wife also is one who takes life<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					of perverted view,<br />
					she is a wicked woman,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					she lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, monks,<br />
					that a vile man<br />
					lives with a vile woman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a devi?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the husband is one who takes life,<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					of perverted view,<br />
					he is a wicked man,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					he lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					he abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wife is one who abstains from taking life,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					one not given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one not covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					not of perverted view,<br />
					she is virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					she lives at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she is no abuser or reviler<br />
					of recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a deva<br />
					live along with a vile woman?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the husband is one who abstains from taking life,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					one not given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one not covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					not of perverted view,<br />
					he is virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					he lives at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					he is no abuser or reviler<br />
					of recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wife is one who takes life<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					one covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					of perverted view,<br />
					she is a wicked woman,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					she lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does a deva<br />
					live along with a vile woman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a deva<br />
					live along with a devi?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case both husband and wife<br />
					are abstainers from,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					they are not given to harsh, bitter speech<br />
					and idle babble,<br />
					they are not covetous, of a malevolent heart,<br />
					not of perverted view,<br />
					they are virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					living at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					not abuseing or reviling<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, monks,<br />
					that a deva<br />
					lives along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four ways of living together.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Both vicious, mean, abusing others, these -<br />
							Husband and wife, a vile pair linked together.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A vicious husband, mean, abusing others;<br />
							A virtuous wife, not stingy, but well-spoken -<br />
							A devi she, paired with a partner vile.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A husband good, not stingy, but well-spoken,<br />
							A vicious wife, stingy, abusing others -<br />
							A woman vile is partnered with a deva.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br />
							Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br />
							One to the other, - manifold the blessings<br />
							That come to wife and husband, and to them<br />
							The blessing of a pleasant life is born;<br />
							Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br />
							So in this world living as dhamma bids,<br />
							The pair, in goodness match'd, i' the deva-world<br />
							Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
