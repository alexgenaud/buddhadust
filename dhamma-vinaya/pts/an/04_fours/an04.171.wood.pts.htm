<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 171. The Buddha describes how it is intent that is the mechanism of action of kamma of body, speech and mind that results in the personal experience of pleasure or pain in body, speech, or mind. Intent, in turn, is shown to be impersonal. The intent driving a deed can arise in the self or in another. Further, the groundwork for action can be known or unknown. In whatever combination of factors it is blindness that is at the bottom of it and the elimination of blindness that ends kamma."/>
