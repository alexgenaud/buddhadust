					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					at the storeyed house of <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/visakha_migaramata.htm">Migāra's Mother</a>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					the Exalted One was sitting<br />
					surrounded by the Order of monks,<br />
					that day being the sabbath.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />
					after scanning the Order of monks<br />
					as they sat in perfect silence,<br />
					addressed the monks,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this company is free<br />
					from idle words<br />
					and idle talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is pure<br />
					and stablished in the essential.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, such an Order of monks as this<br />
					is a company such as it would be hard to find<br />
					anywhere in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Order of monks as this<br />
					is worshipful,<br />
					worthy of honour and gifts,<br />
					worthy of worship with clasped hands upraised,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, such an Order of monks as this<br />
					is a company to which<br />
					even a little being given is much,<br />
					to <a id="pg192"><span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span></a> which much being given<br />
					is more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Order of monks as this<br />
					is a company worth going many a mile to see,<br />
					even if one had to carry his food<br />
					in a bag on his shoulder.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Of such a sort<br />
					is this Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are abiding in this Order of monks<br />
					those who have won access to devas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There are abiding in this Order of monks<br />

					<p class="f4">There are abiding in this Order of monks<br />

					<p class="f4">There are abiding in this Order of monks<br />
					those who have won access to the Ariyan.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And how has a monk won access to the devas?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from evil conditions,<br />
					enters upon the first musing,<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					enters upon the second musing,<br />
					that calming of the inner self,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">by the fading out of zest,<br />
					disinterested,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					experiences in his own person<br />
					that ease of which the Ariyans declare:<br />
					"He who is disinterested and alert<br />
					dwells at ease,"<br />
					— thus he attains and abides in the third musing.</p>

					<p class="f4">by abandoning both ease and discomfort,<br />
					by the ending of both happiness and unhappiness felt before,<br />
					attains the fourth musing,<br />
					a state of neither ease nor discomfort,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br />
					and having attained it abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk has won access to the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how has a monk won access to Brahmā?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br />
					with a heart possessed of goodwill;<br />
					so also as to the second,<br />
					third<br />
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br />
					and in like manner above,<br />
					below,<br />

					for all sorts and conditions,<br />
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br />
					with a heart possessed of goodwill<br />
					that is widespread,<br />

					free from enmity<br />
					and untroubled;</p>

					<p class="f4">irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br />

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk has won access to Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how has a monk won access to the Imperturbable?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, passing utterly beyond all consciousness of objects,<br />
					by ending the consciousness of reaction,<br />
					by disregarding consciousness of diversity,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Infinite is space',</p>

					<p class="f4">attains and abides in<br />
					the sphere of infinite space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br />
					reaching the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Infinite is consciousness',</p>

					<p class="f4">he attains and abides in<br />
					the sphere of infinite consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing utterly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There is nothing at all',</p>

					<p class="f4">he attains and abides in<br />
					the sphere of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing utterly beyond the sphere of nothingness,<br />
					he attains and abides in<br />
					the sphere of neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has a monk won access to the Imperturbable.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how has a monk won access to the Ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk understands,<br />
					as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the arising of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the practice<br />
					going to the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk has won access to the Ariyan.'</p>
