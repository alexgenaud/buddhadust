					among the generality of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is eternal or<br />
					The world is not eternal:<br />
					The world is finite or<br />
					The world is infinite:<br />
					What is life,<br />
					that is <a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> body; or<br />
					One thing is life,<br />
					another thing is body;<br />
					A Tathāgata is beyond death or<br />
					A Tathāgata is not beyond death; or,<br />

					dropped,<br />
					abandoned,<br />
					and renounced.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk has shaken off individual beliefs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one who has utterly given up quests?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the quest after sense-pleasure is abandoned by a monk,<br />
					the quest after becoming is abandoned,<br />
					the quest after the holy life has become allayed.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk is one who has utterly given up quests.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk one whose body-complex is calmed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by abandoning pleasure<br />
					and abandoning pain,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the ease and discomfort which he had before,<br />
					attains and abides in a state of neither pain nor pleasure,<br />
					an equanimity of utter purity,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk "withdrawn"?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the conceit of "I am" is abandoned in a monk,<br />
					cut off at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made not to become again,<br />
					of a nature not to arise again in future time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk is withdrawn.</p>

							Who from all sensual lust is purified,<br />
							Who by destroying craving is set free,<br />
							Quests are renounced, wrong views are rooted out.<br />
							That monk at peace, composed and tranquil-minded,<br />
							Unconquered one, by comprehending pride<br />
