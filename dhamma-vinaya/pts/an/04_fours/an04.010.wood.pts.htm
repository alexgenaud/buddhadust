					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying among the Vajjians, at Bhaṇḍagāma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to theExalted One. The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four bonds. What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The bond of passions,<br />
					that of becoming,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that of view and<br />
					the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the bond of passions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain one understands not, as they really are, the arising, the passing away, the satisfaction, the disadvantage of and the escape from the passions.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who understands not these things as they really are, the passionate lust, the passionate delight, the passionate affection, the passionate greed, the passionate thirst, the passionate fever, cleaving and craving that is in the passions, which occupies his mind, - this, monks, is called "the bond of passions."</p>

					<p class="f4">So much for the bond of passions.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is it with the bond of becoming?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one understands not, as they really are, the arising, the passing away, the satisfaction, the disadvantage of and the escape from becomings.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> In him who understands not these things, as they really are, the lust for becomings, the delight in becomings, the affection for becomings, the greed for becomings, the thirst, fever, clinging, the craving for becoming that is becomings, which occupies his mind, - this, monks, is called "the bond of becoming."</p>

					<p class="f4">So much for the bond of passions and the bond of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is it with the bond of view?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So much for the bonds of passions, becoming and view.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what of the bond of ignorance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one understands not, as they really are, the arising of the six spheres of sense, the passing away, the satisfaction, the disadvantage of and the escape therefrom. In him who understands not (these things) as they really are, the ignorance, the nescience of the six spheres of sense which occupies his mind, - this, monks, is called "the bond of ignorance."</p>

					<p class="f4">In bondage to evil, unprofitable things which defile, which lead to again-becoming, which are distressing and have sorrow for their result, which are concerned with birth and decay, he is therefore called "one who rests not from bondage."</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four bonds.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, there are these four releases from the bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The release from the bond of passions,<br />
					the release from that of becoming,<br />
					the release from that of view and<br />
					the release from the bond of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one understands, as they really are, the arising the passing away, the satisfaction, the disadvantage of and the escape from the passions.</p>
