<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 130. The Buddha points out the marvelous way nobles, brahmins, householders and ascetics take delight when a Wheel-turning King approaches and speaks and then he compares this phenomena with the similar thing that happens when Ānanda approaches and teaches bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, laymen and lay-women." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four wonderful, marvellous things about a wheel-turning ruler.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of noblemen comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of noblemen when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of brahmins comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of brahmins when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of householders comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of householders when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of noblemen comes to visit a wheel-turning ruler, they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if the ruler speaks they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied, monks, is a company of recluses when the wheel-turning ruler becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">These then, monks, are the four wonderful, marvellous things about a wheel-turning ruler.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, monks, there are four wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of monks comes to visit Ānanda,<br />
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma,<br />
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of monks<br />
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of nuns comes to visit Ānanda,<br />
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br />
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of nuns<br />
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laymen<br />
					comes to visit Ānanda,<br />
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br />
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples who are laymen<br />
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a company of disciples who are laywomen<br />
					comes to visit Ānanda,<br />
					they are delighted at the sight of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then if Ānanda speaks Dhamma<br />
					they are delighted with what he says.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dissatisfied is the company of disciples<br />
					that are laywomen<br />
					when Ānanda becomes silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four wonderful, marvellous things about Ānanda.'</p>
