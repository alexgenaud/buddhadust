<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 178. The Buddha describes two pairs of individuals. One pair is striving to get rid of 'own-body', the other is striving to break up 'blindness'. In each of the pairs the persons have attained peaceful states of mind and liberation of heart and work at their objective but in one case there is no excitement at the task while in the other there is. The Buddha states that where this excitement is missing, the task is unlikely to be accomplished." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk having attained to<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> some peaceful way of heart's release abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br />

					in the <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> ending of the person-pack;<br />
					it is not released therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br />
					this ending of the person-pack<br />
					is not to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if, monks,<br />
					a man were to seize a branch<br />
					with his hand smeared with resin;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> that hand of his<br />

					would be held fast; -<br />
					even so, monks, when a monk has attained<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But in this case<br />
					suppose a monk has attained<br />
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">For such a monk as this<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks,<br />
					suppose a monk attains<br />

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is a village pond<br />

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br />

					<p class="f4">But in this case<br />
					suppose a monk attains<br />
					to some peaceful way of heart's release<br />

					<p class="f4">He gives work of mind<br />
					to the breaking up of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">His heart leaps up thereto,<br />

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br />
					the breaking up of ignorance<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is a village pond<br />
					that has stood for countless years,<br />
					and a man opens up all its inlets<br />
					and blocks up all its outlets,<br />
					and the sky rains down steadily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus for that village pond<br />
					a breach of dyke is to be looked for.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, monks,<br />
					when a monk attains<br />
					to some peaceful way of heart's release,<br />

					<p class="f4">For such a monk<br />

					<p class="f4">So these, monks, are the four persons<br />
