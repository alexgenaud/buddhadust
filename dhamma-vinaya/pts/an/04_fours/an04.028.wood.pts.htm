					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four Ariyan lineages,<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					as of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and unadulterated now as then,<br />
					are not confounded,<br />
					nor shall they be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a monk is content<br />
					with any sort of robes,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting robes<br />
					he resorts not<br />
					to unseemly and unbecoming conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not robes<br />
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br />
					and if he does get them<br />
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<br />
					of greed,<br />
					of craving for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br />
					and skilled in the escape<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> therefrom<br />
					he makes use of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br />
					because of his content<br />
					with any sort of robes,<br />
					nor does he disparage others<br />
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br />
					not slothful,<br />
					but mindful and heedful,<br />
					this monk is one<br />
					who stands firm<br />
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, a monk is content<br />
					with any sort of alms-food <a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a><br />
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting alms-food<br />
					he resorts not<br />
					to what is unseemly and unbecoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not alms-food<br />
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br />
					and if he does get it<br />
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					of greed,<br />
					of craving for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br />
					and skilled in the escape therefrom,<br />
					he makes use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br />
					because of his content<br />
					with any sort of alms-food,<br />
					nor does he disparage others<br />
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br />
					not slothful,<br />
					but mindful and heedful,<br />
					this monk is one<br />
					who stands firm<br />
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, a monk is content<br />
					with any sort of lodging<br />
					and speaks in praise of such content.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of getting lodging<br />
					he resorts not<br />
					to what is unseemly and unbecoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he gets not lodging<br />
					he is not dismayed thereat:<br />
					and if he does get it<br />
					he is free from the bond of selfishness,<br />
					of greed,<br />
					of craving for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the danger therein<br />
					and skilled in the escape therefrom,<br />
					he makes use of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet does he not exalt himself<br />
					because of his content<br />
					with any sort of lodging,<br />
					nor does he disparage others<br />
					(who are not content).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br />
					not slothful,<br />
					but mindful and heedful,<br />
					this monk is one<br />
					who stands firm<br />
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once more, monks, a monk delights in abandoning.</p>

					<p class="f4">So delighting he delights in making-become.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet because of his delight in abandoning<br />
					and his delight in making-become<br />
					he exalts not himself because of that delight,<br />
					nor does he disparage others<br />
					(who delight not therein).</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso, monks, is skilled herein,<br />
					not slothful,<br />
					but mindful and heedful,<br />
					this monk is one<br />
					who stands firm<br />
					in the primeval, ancient, Ariyan lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four Ariyan lineages<br />
					reckoned as ancient,<br />
					as of long standing,<br />
					as traditional,<br />
					primeval,<br />
					pure and adulterated now as then;<br />
					which are not confounded<br />
					nor shall be,<br />
					are not despised<br />
					by discerning recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, monks, possessed of these four Ariyan lineages,<br />
					if a monk dwell in the east<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he masters discontent<br />
					and content,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the west<br />
					he masters discontent<br />
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the north<br />
					he masters discontent<br />
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a monk dwell in the south<br />
					he masters discontent<br />
					and content, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">A sage, monks masters discontent and content.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">No discontent compels the sage,
							The sage no discontent compels:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
							<a id="pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></a> The sage doth discontent compel,<br />
							Compeller of discontent is he.<br />
							Him, that all kamma hath decided<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>
							And scattered it, who shall restrain?<br />
							Pure as the gold of Jambu he.<br />
							Who is there can speak blame of him?<br />
