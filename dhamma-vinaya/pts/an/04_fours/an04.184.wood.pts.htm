					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the brahmin <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/janussoni.htm">Jāṇussonī</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to visit the Exalted One<br />

					and having greeted him courteously,<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated the brahmin Jāṇussonī<br />

					<p class="f4">'For my part, Master Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, there is such an one.</p>

					fears and falls a-trembling<br />

					<p class="f4">In this case, brahmin, a certain one<br />

					not freed from lusts,<br />
					not freed from desire,<br />
					affection,<br />
					from thirst and fever,<br />
					not freed from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a grievous sickness afflicts such an one.</p>
