					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">'Now the venerable Māluṇkyā's son came to visit the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat thus<br />
					the venerable Māluṇkyā's son said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well for me, lord, if the Exalted One<br />
					would teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing which Dhamma from the Exalted One's lips<br />
					I could dwell alone,<br />
					remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and resolute.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, Māluṇkyā's son,<br />
					what am I to teach the young monks,<br />
					when you,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a broken-down old man,<br />
					far-gone in years,<br />
					beg a teaching in brief<br />
					of the Tathāgata?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg254"><span class="f2 g"><b>[254]</b></span></a> 'Nay, lord, let the Exalted One<br />
					teach me Dhamma in brief!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I could understand the meaning<br />
					of the Exalted One's words!</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely I could become heir<br />
					to the Exalted One's words!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, Māluṇkyā's son,<br />
					there are these four ways<br />
					in which craving arises in a monk<br />
					when it does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because of the robe<br />
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br />
					it is because of alms-food,<br />
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br />
					it is because of lodging,<br />
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise;<br />
					it is because of failure or success<br />
					to become this or that<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that craving arises in a monk when it does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Māluṇkyā's son,<br />
					when craving is abandoned in a monk,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made not to become again,<br />
					made of a nature not to arise again in future time,<br />
					this monk is called</p>

					<p class="f4">"One who has cut off craving,<br />
					broken the bond,<br />
					by perfect comprehension of conceit<br />
					has made an end of Ill."'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Māluṇkyā's son,<br />
					thus instructed by the Exalted One<br />
					with this instruction,<br />
					rose from his seat,<br />
					saluted the Exalted One,<br />
					and keeping his right side towards him<br />
					went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Māluṇkyā's son,<br />
					living solitary,<br />
					remote,<br />
					earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and resolute,<br />
					in that very life<br />
					himself comprehending and realizing<br />
					that unsurpassed perfection of the holy life,<br />
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from the home<br />
					to the homeless,<br />
					having attained it<br />
					abode therein,<br />
					so that he fully comprehended the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cut off is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the holy life,<br />
					done the thing that should be done,<br />
					there is no more of this state of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Māluṇkyā's son<br />
					was yet another of the arahants.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
