<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Sutta 102. Gotama likens four sorts of persons to four sorts of rain-clouds: one that thunders but doesn't rain, one that rains but doesn't thunder, one that neither rains nor thunders, one that both rains and thunders. He defines mastery of Dhamma as thundering, understanding the Four Truths as raining." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four rain-clouds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling rain-clouds<br />
					are to be found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The thunderer not the rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The rainer not the thunderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The neither thunderer nor rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">The both thunderer and rainer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, how is a person<br />
					a thunderer but no rainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a thunderer but not a rainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, monks, a certain person masters Dhamma, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Sutta, Geyya, Veyyākaraṇa, Gāthā, Udāna, Itivuttaka, Jātaka, Abbhutadhamma and Vedalla.</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet he understands not,<br />

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands not,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, a person is one<br />
					who thunders but rains not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as that rain-cloud thunders but rains not,<br />
					even so using this figure<br />
					do I speak of this person.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> In this case a certain person does not master Dhamma,<br />

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person both thunderer and rainer?

					<p class="f4">Just as that cloud both thunders and rains,<br />

					<p class="f4">So these are the four persons found existing in the world.</p>
