					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion<br />
					the Exalted One was journeying along the highroad<br />
					between Madhurā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and Verañja,<br />
					and a large number of housefathers and housewives<br />
					were also journeying along that road.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One,<br />
					stepping off the highroad,<br />
					sat down at the root of a certain tree<br />
					upon a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they saw the Exalted One so doing<br />
					the housefathers and housewives<br />
					came up to him,<br />
					and on reaching the Exalted One saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they sat thus<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to those housefathers and housewives:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Housefathers, there are these four ways<br />
					of living together.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A vile<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> man<br />
					lives along with a vile woman;<br />
					a vile man<br />
					lives <a id="pg67"><span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span></a> along with a devi;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a deva<br />
					lives along with a vile woman;<br />
					a deva<br />
					lives along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way, housefathers,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a vile woman?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, housefathers,<br />
					a husband is one who takes life,<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					he is a wicked man,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					he lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wife also is one who takes life<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					she is a wicked woman,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					she lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, housefathers,<br />
					that a vile man<br />
					lives with a vile woman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, housefathers,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a devi?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the husband is one who takes life,<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					he is a wicked man,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					he lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					he abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wife is one who abstains from taking life,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					she is not given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					she is virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					she lives at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she is no abuser or reviler<br />
					of recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, housefathers,<br />
					does a vile man<br />
					live along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a deva<br />
					live along with a vile woman?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case the husband is one who abstains from taking life,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					he is not given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					he is virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					he lives at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					he is no abuser or reviler<br />
					of recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the wife is one who takes life<br />
					steals,<br />
					is a wrong-doer in sense-desires,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					one given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					she is a wicked woman,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					she lives at home<br />
					with a heart soiled<br />
					by the taint of stinginess,<br />
					she abuses and reviles<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does a deva<br />
					live along with a vile woman.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a deva<br />
					live along with a devi?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case both husband and wife<br />
					are abstainers from,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					wrong-doing in sense-desires,<br />
					lying,<br />
					they are not given to the use of liquor<br />
					fermented and distilled<br />
					which causes sloth;<br />
					they are virtuous,<br />
					of a lovely nature,<br />
					living at home with a heart<br />
					freed from the taint of stinginess,<br />
					not abuseing or reviling<br />
					recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is, housefathers,<br />
					that a deva<br />
					lives along with a devi.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four ways of living together.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Both vicious, mean, abusing others, these -<br />
							Husband and wife, a vile pair linked together.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A vicious husband, mean, abusing others;<br />
							A virtuous wife, not stingy, but well-spoken -<br />
							A devi she, paired with a partner vile.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> A husband good, not stingy, but well-spoken,<br />
							A vicious wife, stingy, abusing others -<br />
							A woman vile is partnered with a deva.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br />
							Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br />
							One to the other, - manifold the blessings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							That come to wife and husband, and to them<br />
							The blessing of a pleasant life<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> is born;<br />
							Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br />
							So in this world living as dhamma bids,<br />
							The pair, in goodness match'd, i' the deva-world<br />
							Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
