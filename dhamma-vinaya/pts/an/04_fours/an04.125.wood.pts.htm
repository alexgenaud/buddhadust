<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 125. The Buddha describes four paths to deva worlds based on the four devine lifestyles: friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment. Then he points out that the destinies of those who are students of the Dhamma are non-returners while those of other beliefs return to the round of rebirths." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person lives<br />
					irradiating one quarter (of the world)<br />
					with a heart possessed of amity;<br />
					so also as to the second,<br />
					third<br />
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br />
					and in like manner above,<br />
					below,<br />
					across,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					for all sorts and conditions,<br />
					he lives irradiating the whole world<br />
					with a heart <a id="pg133"><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></a> possessed of amity<br />
					that is widespread,<br />
					grown great<br />
					and boundless,<br />
					free from enmity<br />
					and untroubled.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys the sweetness of it,<br />
					longs for it<br />
					and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company of devas of the Brahma-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">A kalpa, monks, is the life-span<br />
					of the devas of the Brahmā-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas;<br />
					then he goes to purgatory<br />
					or the womb of an animal,<br />
					he goes to the peta-realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a disciple of the Exalted One,<br />
					after staying there<br />
					and spending his time<br />
					according to the life-span of those devas,<br />
					finally passes away in that same state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, monks, is the distinction,<br />
					such the specific feature,<br />
					the difference between the learned Ariyan disciple<br />
					and the unlearned ordinary man<br />
					in the matter of bourn and rebirth.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, a certain person here<br />
					lives irradiating one quarter of the world<br />
					with a heart possessed of compassion;<br />
					so also as to the second,<br />
					third<br />
					and fourth quarter of the world;<br />
