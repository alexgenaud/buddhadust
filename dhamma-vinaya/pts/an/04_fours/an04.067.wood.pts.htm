					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvaṭṭhī, in Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time at Sāvaṭṭhī a certain monk had been bitten by a snake and had died.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So a great number of monks came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, a certain monk here in Sāvaṭṭhī has been bitten by a snake and has died."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, monks, that monk did not suffuse with heart of amity the four royal families of snakes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had he done so that monk would not have died of snake-bite.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four royal families of snakes?</p>

					<p class="f4">The royal family of snakes called Virūpakkha,<br />
					that called Erāpatha,<br />
					that called Chabyāputta and<br />
					the royal family of <a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> snakes called Kaṇhā-gotamaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, that monk did not suffuse with heart of amity these four royal families of snakes;<br />
					had he done so he would not have died of snake-bite.</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, for self-warding,<br />
					for self-guarding,<br />
					for self-protection I do enjoin<br />
					that ye suffuse with heart of amity<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					these four royal families of snakes, thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">May I have kindness with Virūpakkhas,<br />
							May I have kindness with Erāpathas,<br />
							With Chabyāputtas may I kindness have.<br />
							With Kaṇhā-gotamakas may I have kindness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">May I have kindness with the footless,<br />
							With those of two feet may I kindness have,<br />
							With quadrupeds may I have kindness.<br />
							May I have kindness with the many-footed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Let not the footless do me harm,<br />
							Nor those that have two feet;<br />
							Let not four-footed ones me harm,<br />
							Nor those with many feet.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">All creatures, living things, - may all that has become, -<br />
							May one and all see luck, and may no harm befall.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Infinite the Buddha, infinite is Dhamma, infinite the Order.<br />
					      Finite are creeping things, snakes, scorpions, centipedes;<br />
							Finite are spinning spiders,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> house-lizards, rats and mice.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Done by me is warding, done by me is protection.<br />
							Let all things living now depart in peace.<br />
							I, even I, before the Exalted One bow down;<br />
							Before the seven fully Enlightened Ones I bow.'</p>
