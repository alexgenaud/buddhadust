					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The unshaken recluse,<br />
					the blue-lotus recluse,<br />
					the white-lotus recluse,<br />
					and the recluse who is exquisite among recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person an unshaken recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, one is a pupil,<br />
					who has not made up his mind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but lives aspiring<br />
					for the unsurpassed rest from the toil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is an unshaken recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a blue-lotus recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in the contemplation of the rise and fall of <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/panc_upadana_kkhandha.htm">the five-grasping-groups,</a> thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is form,<br />
					such is the arising of form,<br />
					such is the passing away of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling<br />
					such is the arising of feeling,<br />
					such is the passing away of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">such is perception<br />
					such is the arising of perception,<br />
					such is the passing away of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">such are the activities<br />
					such is the arising of the activities,<br />
					such is the passing away of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">such is consciousness<br />
					such is the arising of consciousness,<br />
					such is the passing away of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does not abide<br />
					experiencing with his own person<br />
					the eight deliverances.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is a blue-lotus recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a white-lotus recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells in the contemplation of the rise and fall of the five-grasping-groups, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is form,<br />
					such is the arising of form,<br />
					such is the passing away of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling<br />
					such is the arising of feeling,<br />
					such is the passing away of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">such is perception<br />
					such is the arising of perception,<br />
					such is the passing away of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">such are the activities<br />
					such is the arising of the activities,<br />
					such is the passing away of the activities.</p>

					<p class="f4">such is consciousness<br />
					such is the arising of consciousness,<br />
					such is the passing away of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But he does abide<br />
					experiencing with his own person<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/vimokkha.htm">the eight deliverances</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a person is a white-lotus recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, monks, is a person a recluse exquisite among recluses?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk when invited<br />
					enjoys a plentiful supply of robes,<br />
					but he gets little if uninvited;<br />
					when invited<br />
					enjoys a plentiful supply of alms-food and lodging;<br />
					but he gets little if uninvited;<br />
					when invited<br />
					he enjoys a plentiful supply of requisites<br />
					and medicines for use in sickness,<br />
					but he gets little if uninvited.</p>

					<p class="f4">With whatsoever fellows in the holy life he dwells,<br />
					their behaviour (towards him)<br />
					in action of body, speech and thought<br />
					is generally pleasing,<br />
					rarely displeasing;<br />
					moreover their presents to him<br />
					are generally pleasing,<br />
					rarely displeasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, as to those afflictions<br />
					which originate from bile,<br />
					phlegm,<br />
					wind,<br />
					from the union of bodily humours,<br />
					from changes of seasons,<br />
					from stress of circumstances,<br />
					from personal assaults,<br />
					or from the ripeness of one's karma, -<br />
					such do not trouble him much.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is free from sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to the four musings<br />
					which belong to the higher thought<br />
					and lead to happy living<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					he is a winner of them at will,<br />
					without difficulty<br />
					and without trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the āsavas<br />
					he reaches the heart's release,<br />
					the release by wisdom,<br />
					himself comprehending it<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, is a person<br />
					a recluse exquisite among recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now monks, if rightly speaking<br />
					one would speak about the recluse exquisite among recluses,<br />
					it is just of me that he would rightly use the words.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the four persons found existing in the world.'</p>
