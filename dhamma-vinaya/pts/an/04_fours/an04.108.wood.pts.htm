<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Sutta 108. The Buddha characterizes the behavior of leaders of sects as resembling the behavior of bulls leading herds of cattle: one is a terror to the cattle of another herd, not to his own; one is a terror to his own herd but not to other herds; one is a terror to both; and one is a terror to neither." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted ONe.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four oxen.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one that is fierce to the cows of its own herd,<br />
					but not to the cows of another herd,<br />
					the one that is fierce to the cows of another herd,<br />
					but not to those of its own herd,<br />
					the one that is fierce to both the cows of its own heard,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg114"><span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span></a> In like manner, monks, these four persons resembling oxen<br />
