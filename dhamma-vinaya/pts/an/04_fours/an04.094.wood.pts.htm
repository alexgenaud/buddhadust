					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these four persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a> Herein again, monks, a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person<br />
					is one who gains neither mental calm of the self,<br />
					nor the higher wisdom<br />
					of insight into things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again a certain person<br />
					is one who gains mental calm of the self,<br />
					and the higher wisdom<br />

					<p class="f4">How are the activities to be understood?</p>
