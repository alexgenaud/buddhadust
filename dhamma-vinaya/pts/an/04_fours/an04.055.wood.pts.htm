<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 55. Nakula's mother and father each approach the Buddha and each, in identical words, states that they are not aware of the other ever having transgressed against them either in thought or deed and then state that they are desirous of seeing each other in lives to come. The Buddha instructs them in how such a thing is to be attained." />

					<p class="f4">Now in the forenoon the Exalted One robed himself,<br />

					<p class="f4">Lord, we do desire to behold each other<br />

					<p class="f4">Then also the housewife, Nakula's mother,<br />

					<p class="f4">[Then said the Exalted One:] 'Herein, householders,<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr"> If both, believers, self-controlled, well-spoken,<br />
					Living as dhamma bids, use loving words<br />
					One to the other, manifold the blessings<br />
					That come to wife and husband, and to them<br />
					The blessing of a pleasant life is born.<br />
					Dejected are their foes, for both are good.<br />
					So in this world, living as dhamma bids,<br />
					The pair, in goodness matched, i' the deva-world<br />
					Rejoicing win the bliss that they desire.'</p>
