<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 4. Poor behavior towards four persons amounts to having uprooted and spoiled one's self, being surrounded by impurity, subject to reproach by the wise, and which results in much bad kamma; while good behavior towards four persons does not uproot, does not spoil the self, surrounds one with purity, brings praise by the wise, and results in much good kamma." />
