					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a great official of Magadha,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">"A fool is the rājah Eḷeyya<br />

					<p class="f4">Why! he even went so far<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover the retinue of the rājah Eḷeyya,<br />
					<a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> such as Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, Nāvindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are fools to be pleased with Rama's son, the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">They too went so far<br />

					<p class="f4">'Well, brahmin, you see<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think those worthies:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they think that?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They do, sir.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just because the recluse, Rāma's son,<br />
					is wiser than the wise rājah Eḷeyya<br />
					and superior to him in insight<br />
					in deciding matters of dispute<br />
					and in the interpretation of terms<br />
