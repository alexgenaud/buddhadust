					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a> in Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Vassakāra,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> a great official of Magadha, came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated, the brahmin Vassakāra,<br />
					a great official of Magadha,<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'For my part, master Gotama,<br />
					I say this,<br />
					I hold this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has seen,<br />
					there is no harm in his saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I saw."</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has heard,<br />
					there is no harm in his saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I heard."</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man speaks of what he has sensed,<br />
					of what he has understood, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus I sensed,<br />
					thus I understood,"</p>

					<p class="f4">there is no harm resulting from that.'</p>

					do not say that all that one has <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> seen<br />
					should be spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brahmin, in so far as to him<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the brahmin Vassakāra,<br />
