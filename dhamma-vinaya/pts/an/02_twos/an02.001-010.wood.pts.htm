					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#jetavana">Jeta Grove,</a> in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.<br />
					Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord,' replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these two faults.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which has its result<br />
					in this very life,<br />
					and that which has its result<br />
					in some future life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, what is a fault<br />
					that has its result<br />
					in this very life?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br />
					one sees rulers seize a robber,<br />
					a miscreant,<br />
					and subjecting [sic] him<br />
					to divers forms of punishment:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					flogging him with whips,<br />
					with canes,<br />
					with cudgels:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					cutting off his hand,<br />
					his foot,<br />
					hand and foot,<br />
					his ear,<br />
					nose,<br />
					ear and nose:<br />
					torturing him with the "gruel-pot,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "chankshave,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					torturing him with "Rāhu's mouth,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "fire- <a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> garland,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "flaming hand,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "hay-twist,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> the "bark-dress,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					"the antelope"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with "flesh-hooking,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "disc-slice,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "pickling process,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with "circling the pin,"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with the "straw mattress."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then they spray him with boiling oil,<br />
					give him as food to dogs,<br />
					spit him alive on a stake<br />
					or chop his head off.</p>

					<p class="f4">The observer (of all this) thinks thus:<br />
					If I were to do such deeds<br />
					as those <a id="hetu">for which</a> the rulers seize a robber,<br />
					a miscreant,<br />
					and so treat him ...<br />
					they would surely treat me in like manner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus scared at the thought<br />
					of a fault (which has its result) in this very life,<br />
					he goes not about<br />
					plundering others' property.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					"a fault with immediate retribution."</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is<br />
					a fault with future retribution?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br />
					someone may thus reflect:<br />
					Evil in the future life<br />
					is the fruit of bodily offence.<br />
					Evil is the fruit of offence by word,<br />
					by 'thought,<br />
					in the future life.<br />
					If I offend in deed,<br />
					in word,<br />
					in thought,<br />
					should not I,<br />
					when body breaks up,<br />
					after death<br />
					be reborn in the Waste,<br />
					the Way of Woe,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					in Purgatory?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> Thus scared at the thought<br />
					of a fault to be atoned for in a future life,<br />
					he abandons immorality<br />
					in deeds of body<br />
					and practises morality<br />
					in deeds of body:<br />
					abandons immorality<br />
					in the practice of speech and thought,<br />
					and cultivates morality therein<br />
					and conducts himself<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with utter purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called<br />
					"a fault with future retribution."</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks, I say unto you:<br />
					Thus must ye train yourselves:<br />
					— "We will fear faults with immediate,<br />
					we will fear faults with future retribution.<br />
					We will shun<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> faults,<br />
					we will see danger in faults."</p>

					<p class="f4">Of one who does so, monks,<br />
					it may be expected<br />
					that he will be released from all faults.</p>

					are hard to undergo in the world.<br />
					What two?</p>

					<p class="f4">The struggle of householders<br />
					who live at home<br />
					to provide clothing, food, lodging,<br />
					medicines for the sick,<br />
					and provision of necessaries:<br />
					and the struggle of those<br />
					who have gone forth from home to the homeless,<br />
					to renounce all substrates of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the two struggles ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these two, monks,<br />
					the latter is the more important.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore I say unto you:<br />
					Thus must ye train yourselves: —<br />
					"We will undertake the struggle<br />

					<p class="f4">Without shrinking back, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">By my earnest endeavour, monks,<br />

					<p class="f4">And ye too, monks, —<br />
