<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 60. Sangarava approaches Gotama with the idea that those who perform sacrifices do more good for more people than those who leave the household life for the homeless state. Gotama then raises the case of a Buddha arising in the world, one who teaches multitudes, gods and men. There follows discussion of the merits of various magic powers." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Saŋgārava,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the brahmin, came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br />
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Master Gotama, we brahmins,<br />
					let me tell you,<br />
					offer sacrifice<br />
					and cause others to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, master Gotama<br />
					whoso offers sacrifice<br />
					or causes others to do so,<br />
					one and all are proficient<br />
					in a practice of merit<br />
					that affects many persons;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that is,<br />
					which results from offering sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br />
					he who goes forth<br />
					as a Wanderer from this or that family,<br />
					from the home to the homeless life,<br />
					tames only the single self,<br />
					calms only the single self,<br />
					leads to Nibbāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					only the single self.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what I say is,<br />
					thus he is proficient in a practice of merit<br />
					that affects only one person,<br />
					as a result of his going forth (as a Wanderer)."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Well, brahmin, as to that I will question you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br />
					a Tathāgata arises in the world,<br />
					an Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					Wellfarer,<br />
					World-knower,<br />
					incomparable Charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					Teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come! this is the way,<br />
					this the practice,<br />
					proficient in which<br />
					I make known that incomparable <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> bliss<br />
					wbich is steeped in the holy life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by my own powers of comprehension realizing it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come ye also!</p>

					<p class="f4">Practise so that ye too<br />
					may be proficient therein,<br />
					so that ye too<br />
					by your own powers of comprehension<br />
					may realize it<br />
					and abide therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this teacher teaches Dhamma<br />
					and others too practise to attain that end.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover there are many hundreds,<br />
					many thousands,<br />
					many hundreds of thousands of such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Since this is so,<br />
					is it a practice of merit<br />
					affecting only one person<br />
					or many persons;<br />
					that is,<br />
					the result of going forth as a Wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, master Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">It affects many persons,<br />
					this going forth."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. At these words<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said this<br />
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of these two practices, brahmin,<br />
					which appeals to you as being the simpler,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the less troublesome,<br />
					of greater fruit,<br />
					profit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words<br />
					the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br />
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br />
					both are to me<br />
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said<br />
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br />
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br />
					as being the simpler<br />
					and less troublesome,<br />
					of greater fruit<br />
					of greater profit?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br />
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br />
					both are to me<br />
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time<br />
					the venerable Ānanda said<br />
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I do not ask you that, brahmin,<br />
					as to whom you honour and praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am asking you:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Which of the two practices appeals to you<br />
					as being the simpler<br />
					and less troublesome,<br />
					of greater fruit<br />
					of greater profit'"?</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the brahmin Saŋgārava said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the worthy Gotama<br />
					and the worthy Ānanda,<br />
					both are to me<br />
					worthy of honour and praise."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg153"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></a> 3. Thereupon the Exalted One thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even for a third time the brahmin,<br />
					on being asked a pertinent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> question by Ānanda,<br />
					evades<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> it,<br />
					does not reply to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose I release them<br />
					from their difficulty."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One said this<br />
					to the brahmin Saŋgārava:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tell me, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the topic of conversation today<br />
					when the royal party sat together in company<br />
					in the rajah's palace?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This was the topic of conversation, master Gotama: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'In former times, you know,<br />
					monks were fewer in number:<br />
					but those possessed of supernormal powers<br />
					being more numerous,<br />
					they showed the marvel of more-power.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But now it is just the opposite.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That was the topic of conversation today, master Gotama,<br />
					when the royal party sat together in company<br />
					in the rajah's palace."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Now as to that, brahmin,<br />
					there are these three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The marvel of more-power,<br />
					the marvel of thought-reading,<br />
					the marvel of teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, brahmin, is the marvel of more-power?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one enjoys sorts of more-power<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one:<br />
					manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if through the air:<br />
					he plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water:<br />
					he walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it<br />
					as if on solid ground:<br />
					he travels through the air<br />
					sitting cross-legged,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing:<br />
					even this moon and sun,<br />
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br />
					he handles them<br />
					and strokes them with his hand:<br />
					even as far as the Brahma <a id="pg154"><span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></a> world<br />
					he has power with his body.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br />
					'the marvel of more-power.'</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And what, brahmin,<br />
					is the marvel of thought-reading?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In this case<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> a certain one<br />
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />
					so it is<br />
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, brahmin,<br />
					perhaps a certain one<br />
					does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br />
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br />
					or non-humans<br />
					or from devas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />
					so it is<br />
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again, brahmin,<br />
					perhaps a certain one<br />
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br />
					or on hearing a voice from men<br />
					or non-humans<br />
					or from devas,<br />
					but he does so (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br />
					an utterance intelligently made<br />
					by one who is reasoning intelligently.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />
					so it is<br />
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg155"><span class="f2 g"><b>[155]</b></span></a> Then again, brahmin,<br />
					in this case suppose a certain one<br />
					does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br />
					or on hearing a voice from men<br />
					or non-humans<br />
					or from devas,<br />
					or by (judging) from some sound he has heard,<br />
					an utterance intelligently made<br />
					by one who is reasoning intelligently<br />
					yet maybe,<br />
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br />
					which is void of thought applied and sustained,<br />
					one's mind can read another's thoughts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and know thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'According to the nature<br />
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br />
					on such and such objects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
					will he immediately<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> direct his thoughts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then however much he may tell,<br />
					so it is<br />
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br />
					'the marvel of mind-reading.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. And what, brahmin,<br />
					is the marvel of teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br />
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br />
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br />
					acquire that state<br />
					and abide therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is called<br />
					'the marvel of teaching.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So these are the three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now of these three marvels,<br />
					which appeals to you<br />
					as the more wonderful and excellent"?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of these marvels, master Gotama,<br />
					the marvel of more-power —</p>

					<p class="f4">from being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one:<br />
					manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />
					through a mountain,<br />
					as if through the air:<br />
					he plunges into the earth<br />
					and shoots up again<br />
					as if in water:<br />
					he walks upon the water<br />
					without parting it<br />
					as if on solid ground:<br />
					he travels through the air<br />
					sitting cross-legged,<br />
					like a bird upon the wing:<br />
					even this moon and sun,<br />
					though of such mighty power and majesty, -<br />
					he handles them<br />
					and strokes them with his hand:<br />
					even as far as the Brahma world<br />
					he has power with his body —</p>

					<p class="f4">he who performs it has the experience thereof;<br />
					it is a possession of him who performs it —</p>

					<p class="f4">seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then again as to the marvel of thought-reading —</p>

					<p class="f4">That a certain one<br />
					can declare by means of a sign:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />
					so it is<br />
					and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare such things by means of a sign,<br />
					but he does so after hearing a voice from men<br />
					or non-humans<br />
					or from devas,<br />
					and says:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such and such is your mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus is your consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br />

					<p class="f4">So hearing he declares:</p>

					<p class="f4">And however much he may tell,<br />

					<p class="f4">And again, though he does not declare these things by means of a sign,<br />

					yet maybe,<br />

					one's mind can read another's thoughts<br />

					<p class="f4">'According to the nature<br />

					it is a possession of him who performs it —</p>

					<p class="f4">also seems to me to be of the nature of an illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to the marvel of teaching<br />
					wherein a certain one teaches thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reason thus,<br />
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br />
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br />
					acquire that state<br />
					and abide therein.' —</p>

					<p class="f4">of these three marvels<br />
					this one appeals to me<br />
					as the more wonderful and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is strange, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful<br />
					how well the worthy Gotama<br />
					has spoken of this thing!</p>

					<p class="f4">We do hold the worthy Gotama<br />
					to possess all three marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama<br />
					enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one he becomes many,<br />
					from being many he becomes one:<br />
					manifest or invisible<br />
					he goes unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />

					even this moon and sun,<br />

					he handles them<br />
					and strokes them with his hand:<br />
					even as far as <a id="pg156"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span></a> the Brahma world<br />
					he has power with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surely the worthy Gotama's mind<br />
					can read another's thoughts<br />
					when he has attained a state of concentration<br />
					void of thought applied and sustained,<br />
					so as to know:</p>

					<p class="f4">According to the nature<br />
					of the thinkings of this worthy,<br />
					on such and such objects<br />
					will he immediately direct his thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, surely the worthy Gotama<br />
					teaches thus:</p>

					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind thus,<br />
					not thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Abandon this state,<br />
					acquire that state<br />
					and abide therein.'" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, brahmin,<br />
					your words come close<br />
					and challenge me to a statement!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Nevertheless I will satisfy you<br />
					by replying.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do indeed enjoys sorts of more-power in divers ways, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">From being one I become many,<br />
					from being many I become one:<br />
					manifest or invisible<br />
					I go unhindered through a wall,<br />
					through a rampart,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then again, brahmin,<br />

					<p class="f4">I do so instruct."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, master Gotama,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, indeed, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks possessed of these three marvellous powers<br />
