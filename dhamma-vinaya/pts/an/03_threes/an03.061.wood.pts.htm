<meta name="description" content="The F. L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 61. The Buddha lays out three positions concerning what is going on here which lead to making no effort to extract oneself from a bondage which entails pain and the endless continuation of pain in rebirth. He then explains his doctrine which does inspire activity towards ending pain and rebirth." />
