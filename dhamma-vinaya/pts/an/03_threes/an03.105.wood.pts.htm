					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>,<br />
					at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/anathapindiko.htm">Anāthapiṇḍika</a> the housefather came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat the Exalted One said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Housefather, when the thought is unguarded,<br />
					bodily action also is unguarded,<br />
					speech and mental action also are unguarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action,<br />
					speech<br />
					and mental action are unguarded<br />
					they are saturated with lust.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">When these are thus saturated with lust<br />
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are rotten<br />
					one's death is not auspicious,<br />
					one has no happy ending.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, housefather,<br />
					just as when a peaked house is unthatched<br />
					the peak is not protected,<br />
					the roof-beams are not protected,<br />
					the wall is not protected.</p>

					<p class="f4">The peak,<br />
					roof-beams<br />
					and wall are saturated,<br />
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just so, when thought is unguarded,<br />
					bodily action is unguarded,<br />
					bodily action also is unguarded,<br />
					speech and mental action also are unguarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action, speech and mental action are unguarded<br />
					they are saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When these are thus saturated with lust<br />
					they are rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are rotten<br />
					one's death is not auspicious,<br />
					one has no happy ending.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But, housefather,<br />
					when thoght is guarded,<br />
					bodily action also is guarded,<br />
					speech and mental action also are guarded.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action and the rest are guarded,<br />
					bodily action, speech and mental action are not saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is so they are not rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are not rotten<br />
					one's death is auspicious,<br />
					he has a happy ending.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a peaked house is well thatched,<br />
					the peak, roof-beams and wall are protected,<br />
					they are not saturated,<br />
					they are not rotten;<br />
					even so, housefather,<br />
					when thoght is guarded,<br />
					bodily action also is guarded,<br />
					speech and mental action also are guarded.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In him whose bodily action and the rest are guarded,<br />
					bodily action, speech and mental action are not saturated with lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that is so they are not rotten.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they are not rotten<br />
					one's death is auspicious,<br />
					he has a happy ending."</p>
