					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The training in the higher morality,<br />
					that in the higher thought<br />
					and that in the higher insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher morality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk lives virtuous,<br />
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br />
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br />
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br />
					he takes up and trains himself<br />
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the training in the higher morality.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, remote from sensual desires,<br />
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br />
					enters on the first musing<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second musing,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br />
					he becomes balanced<br />
					and remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the training in the higher thought.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, by destroying the āsavas,<br />
					himself in this very life<br />
					comes to know thoroughly<br />
					the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is without the āsavas,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					"the training in the higher insight."</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three forms of training.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso hath zeal, courage and energy,<br />

							Let him pursue the threefold higher walk,<br />
							<a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> Loftiest code of conduct, mind, insight,<br />
							From first to last, the last e'en as the first,<br />
							Above, below,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> by night e'en as by day.<br />

							Mastered with infinite concentration<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> rapt,<br />
							This do they call the training and the course<br />
							And eke the pure and holy pilgrimage.<br />
							Him do they call The Wakened of the World,<br />
							Brave hero<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> faring to the Way's High End.<br />
							To him when consciousness doth near its end,<br />
							To him from craving utterly set free,<br />
