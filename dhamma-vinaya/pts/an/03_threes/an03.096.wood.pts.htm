					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Possessed of three qualities, monks,<br />
					a rajah's noble thoroughbred steed<br />
					is worthy of the rajah,<br />
					a royal possession,<br />
					and is reckoned an attribute of royalty.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the rajah's noble thoroughbred<br />
					is blessed with beauty,<br />
					with strength<br />
					and speed.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three qualities,<br />
					possessed of which<br />
					a rajah's noble thoroughbred steed<br />
					is worthy of the rajah,<br />
					a royal possession,<br />
					and is reckoned an attribute of royalty.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In like manner, monks,<br />
					possessed of three things<br />
					a monk is worthy of offerings,<br />
					worthy of hospitality,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Beauty (of life),<br />
					strength (of character)<br />
					and speed (of insight).</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And how is a monk blessed<br />
					with beauty (of life)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk is moral,<br />
					he lives restrained<br />
					with the restraint of the obligations,<br />
					proficient in the practice of good conduct;<br />
					seeing danger in trifling faults,<br />
					he trains himself in the rules<br />
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has beauty (of life).</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. And how is a monk blessed<br />
					with strength (of character)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk dwells ardent in energy,<br />
					ever striving to abandon bad qualities,<br />
					to acquire good qualities,<br />
					strenuously exerting himself,<br />
					not throwing off the burden<br />
					in good qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he has strength.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. And how is a monk blessed with speed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life<br />
					knowing it thoroughly<br />
					realizes the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is free from the āsavas,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way a monk is blessed with speed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these three qualities a monk is worthy of offerings<br />
					worthy of hospitality,<br />
					worthy of gifts,<br />
					of salutations with clasped hands,<br />
					a field of merit unsurpassed for the world."</p>
