<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 122. The Buddha describes how living in srife arises from sensual, deviant and violent thinking and that where the bhikkhus live in strife is unpleasant to even think about, let alone visit, but where the bhikkhus live in harmony, without sensual, deviant and violent thinking it is pleasant to visit, let alone think about." />
