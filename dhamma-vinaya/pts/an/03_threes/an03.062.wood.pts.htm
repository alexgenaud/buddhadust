							<p>The phrase "a way which joins mother and son" is a mis-translation, and a dangerous and misleading one at that. The sutta is speaking about overcoming terrors, not ways to unite mother and son. Further the Way is not a way to unite mothers and sons except possibly in the sense of both being followers at the same time, that is, being united in an idea, certainly there is no idea here of being united in some after-life. See the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bd/an/03_threes/an03.062.olds.bd.htm">Olds translation</a> or the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/03_threes/an03.062.than.ati.htm">Bhk.

					<p class="f4">7. But, monks, there is a way,<br />

					a way which joins mother and son.</p>
