<meta name="description" content="The F. L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 64. Sarabha has quit the sangha believing he understands the Dhamm. He goes around boasting that it is because he understands the Dhamma that he rejects it. The bhikkhus ask the Buddha to set him straight, out of compassion, and he does so. After repeatedly giving Sarabha an opportunity to explain himself which he is unable to do, not even being able to respond at all, the Buddha departs through the air. Sarabha's friends have a great time at his expense as a result." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					on the hill Vulture's Peak.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sarabha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> so called,<br />
					the Wanderer,<br />
					who had not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline,<br />
					was thus speaking in the company<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> at Rājagaha:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> "I understand the 'Dhamma'<br />
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br />
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then a number of monks,<br />
					having robed themselves,<br />
					taking bowl and outer robe,<br />
					entered Rājagaha to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those monks heard Sarabha the Wanderer<br />
					so speaking<br />
					in the company at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when they had done their begging-rounds<br />
					and had returned and eaten their meal,<br />
					they went to the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					they said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Sarabha the Wanderer<br />
					has not long since deserted this Dhamma-Discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">At Rājagaha he is thus speaking in the company:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br />
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br />
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, it would be well<br />
					if the Exalted One were to go to Snake River bank,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to the Wanderers' Park<br />
					where is Sarabha the Wanderer,<br />
					out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One consented by silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the Exalted One,<br />
					rising up from his solitary meditation at eventide,<br />
					went to Snake River bank,<br />
					to visit Sarabha the Wanderer<br />
					in the Wanderers' Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching this<br />
					he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />
					the Exalted One said this<br />
					to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, as I hear, Sarabha,<br />
					that you say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand the "Dhamma"<br />
					of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I understand it<br />
					that I have deserted that Dhamma-Discipline?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time<br />
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br />
					the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br />
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br />
					I shall receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> And a second time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then for the third time<br />
					the Exalted One spoke to Sarabha the Wanderer, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sarabha, it is by me<br />
					that the 'Dhamma' of the Sakyans' sons<br />
					who are recluses<br />
					has been revealed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you have understood<br />
					the 'Dhamma' of the recluses who are Sakyans' sons?</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete<br />
					I will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete<br />
					I shall receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time Sarabha the Wanderer was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Thereupon the Wanderers of Rājagaha<br />
					said this to Sarabha the Wanderer:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, whatever you may have to ask Gotama the recluse,<br />
					he gives you the opportunity to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak, reverend Sarabha!</p>

					<p class="f4">If your knowledge is incomplete,<br />
					Gotama the recluse will complete it for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is complete,<br />
					he will receive it gladly."</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Sarabha the Wanderer remained silent,<br />
					confused,<br />
					hanging his head,<br />
					looking downwards,<br />
					a disappointed man,<br />
					unable to make reply.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. So the Exalted One,<br />
					seeing him in this condition,<br />
					said to those Wanderers:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wanderers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> if any one should say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have not perfect knowledge of these things,<br />
					though you claim to be fully enlightened,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br />
					question him<br />
					and talk with him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br />
					questioned<br />
					and talked with,<br />
					would surely and inevitably<br />
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br />
					malignity<br />
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br />
					confused,<br />
					hanging his head,<br />
					looking downwards,<br />
					a disappointed man,<br />
					unable to make reply,<br />
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg170"><span class="f2 g"><b>[170]</b></span></a> Wanderers, if any one were to say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The "Dhamma" preached by you<br />
					for the purpose of utterly destroying Ill<br />
					does not lead those who act accordingly<br />
					to such a goal,'</p>

					<p class="f4">I should closely examine him,<br />
					question him<br />
					and talk with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, thus closely examined,<br />
					questioned<br />
					and talked with,<br />
					would surely and inevitably<br />
					be reduced to one of these three conditions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Either he would shelve the question by another,<br />
					and direct the talk to an alien subject;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would display anger,<br />
					malignity<br />
					and sulkiness;</p>

					<p class="f4">or he would sit silent,<br />
					confused,<br />
					hanging his head,<br />
					looking downwards,<br />
					a disappointed man,<br />
					unable to make reply,<br />
					just as now does Sarabha the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, having thrice<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> uttered his lion's roar<br />
					in the Wanderers' Park<br />
					on the bank of Snake River,<br />
					departed through the air.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">6. Now not long after the departure of the Exalted One<br />
					those Wanderers assailed Sarabha the Wanderer on all sides<br />
					with a torrent of abuse,<br />
					and poking fun at him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend Sarabha, even as a decrepit jackal<br />
					in the great forest,<br />
					thinking to utter a lion's roar,<br />
					can only let out just a jackal's scream,<br />
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br />
					thinking to utter the lion's roar<br />
					which none but Gotama the recluse can utter, -<br />
					you give just such a jackal's scream.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a poor little hen<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					thinks to crow like a cock,<br />
					and after all lets out just a poor little hen's cackle,<br />
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br />
					thinking to utter the cock-crow<br />
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter,<br />
					let out just a poor little hen's cackle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Friend Sarabha, just as a young bull-calf,<br />
					when the cow-pen is empty,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
					thinks he bellows deeply (like an old bull),<br />
					so you, friend Sarabha,<br />
					think to utter the deep bellow<br />
					that none but Gotama the recluse can utter."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did those Wanderers assail Sarabha the Wanderer<br />
					with a torrent of abuse,<br />
					poking fun at him.</p>
