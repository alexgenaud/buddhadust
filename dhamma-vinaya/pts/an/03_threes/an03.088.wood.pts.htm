					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> The training in the higher morality,<br />
					that in the higher thought<br />
					and that in the higher insight.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher morality?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk lives virtuous,<br />
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br />
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br />
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br />
					he takes up and trains himself<br />
					in the rules of morality.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the training in the higher morality.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, remote from sensual desires,<br />
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br />
					enters on the first musing<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second musing,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br />
					he becomes balanced<br />
					and remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the training in the higher thought.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, monks, is the training in the higher insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk understands, as it really is, the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice leading to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					'the training in the higher insight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three forms of training."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>A better approach would be to change the translation of 'citta'. "Heart" This is training in serenity [<i>samādhi</i>] which is more a state of the heart than of the mind.</p>
