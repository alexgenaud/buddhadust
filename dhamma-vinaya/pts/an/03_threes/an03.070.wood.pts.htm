					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a><br />
					in East Park,<br />
					in the terraced house of Migāra's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/visakha_migaramata.htm">Visākhā,</a> Migāra's<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> mother,<br />
					on the Sabbath day<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him she saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she thus sat the Exalted One said this to Visākhā, Migāra's mother:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Visākhā!</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that you come at noon?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, today I am keeping the Sabbath."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, there are these three Sabbaths, Visākhā.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the herdsman's Sabbath,<br />
					that of the naked ascetics<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					and that of the Ariyans.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now what, Visākhā,<br />
					is the herdsman's Sabbath?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, Visākhā,<br />
					the herdsman at eventide<br />
					restores the kine to their owners.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today the kine <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> grazed at such and such a spot,<br />
					and drank at such and such a spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow they will graze and drink<br />
					at such and such a spot.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way<br />
					some Sabbath-keeper here thus reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Tomorrow I shall eat such and such food,<br />
					both hard and soft.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he spends the day<br />
					engrossed in that covetous desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Visākhā,<br />
					is the herdsman's Sabbath.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Sabbath of the herdsman<br />
					thus spent<br />
					is not of great fruit or profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not very brilliant.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not of great radiance.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And what, Visākhā,<br />
					is the naked ascetic's Sabbath?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a sect of naked ascetics, so called,<br />
					a sort of recluses,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who exhort a disciple thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, my good fellow,<br />
					lay aside the stick<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as regards all creatures that exist<br />
					eastwards beyond a hundred yojanas:<br />
					likewise westward,<br />
					northwards<br />
					and to the south!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they exhort them<br />
					to kindness and compassion<br />
					towards some creatures only,<br />
					but not to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again on the Sabbath<br />
					they exhort a disciple thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, good fellow!</p>

					<p class="f4">Off with all your clothes and say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have no part<br />
					in anything anywhere,<br />
					and herein for me<br />
					there is no attachment<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to anything."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br />
					his parents know him for their son<br />
					and he knows them for his parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">His children and wife<br />
					know him for father and husband,<br />
					and he knows them for children and wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet for all that<br />
					his slaves and workmen<br />
					know him for their master<br />
					and he in turn knows them<br />
					for his slaves and workmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus at a time<br />
					when one and all should be exhorted (to keep the Sabbath),<br />
					it is in falsehood that they exhort them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I declare<br />
					is as good as telling lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as soon as that night has passed<br />
					he resumes the use of his belongings,<br />
					which had not been given back to him really.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I declare<br />
					is as good as stealing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Visākhā,<br />
					is the Sabbath of the naked ascetics.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Sabbath of the naked ascetics thus spent<br />
					is not of great fruit or profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not very brilliant.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not of great radiance.</p>

					unsurpassed charioteer of beings to be tamed,<br />
					Teacher of Devas and mankind,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he thus bethinks him<br />

J. Thomas, <i>The Buddha,</i> p. 13: The Angas, east of Magadha; the Magadhas, now called Behar; the Kāsis, round Benares; the Kosalans, in Nepal; their capital, Sāvatthī; the Vajjians, eight clans including the Licchavī and Videhas, not far from Vesālī; the Mallas, of Kusinārā and Pāvā (<i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/02_nv/sn02.15.013.rhyc.pts.htm"><i>S.</i> ii, 187</a>); the Cetis (Ceḍī), probably in Nepal; the Vaṅsas (or Vacchā: our text reads <i>Vangā</i> [? Bengal], but <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.042.pali.bd.htm#pg252"><i>A.</i> iv, 252,</a> <i>Vaṅsā</i>); the Kurus, near modern Delhi; the Pañcālas (text <i>Pañcalā</i>), to the east of the Kurus; the Macchas (Matsyā), to the south of the Kurus; the Surasenas, south-west of the Macchas; the Assakas, on the river Godhāvari; Avanti, of which the capital was Ujjeni, Gandhārā (modern Kandahar), and Kambojā (not modern Kambodia), in the far north-west.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is curious that <i>Comy.</i> seems to know nothing of these names, at any rate it does not notice them here. In fact its knowledge of geography is generally nil. If a name occurs <i>Comy.</i> remarks, if at all, 'a place of such a name.' This same list occurs in a similar comparison at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.042.pali.bd.htm#pg252"><i>A.</i> iv, 252 <i>ff.</i>,</a> and a list of twelve is at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.18.pali.bd.htm"><i>D.</i> ii, 200.</a> As Prof. Rhys Davids remarks (<i>loc. cit.</i>): 'Not only is the whole of South India and Ceylon ignored in it, but there is also no mention of Orissa, of Bengal east of the Ganges, or even of the Dekkan.' These facts contradict the Sinhalese tradition of their colonization of Ceylon (Lanka) in the very year of the Buddha's death.</p>
