<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 100. The Buddha compares the process of attaining the higher mind through meditation to the steps required for the refining of gold. The goldsmith balances use of heat, cooling and examination; the bhikkhu must balance his development of serenity, energy and detachment. In the same way that over-emphasis of one aspect of the process by the goldsmith will likely result in the ruination of the gold, the over-emphasis by the bhikkhu on samadhi will result in sloth, overemphasis on energy building will result in anxiety, and overemphasis on objective detachment will result in the lack of serenity necessary to end the corrupting influences. There are in this sutta very helpful descriptions of the faults to be looked for and got rid of for each stage of advancement in the meditative process." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are gross impurities in gold,<br />
					such as dust<br />
					and sand,<br />
					gravel<br />
					and grit.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dirt-washer<br />

					<p class="f4">When this process is abandoned and ended,<br />
					there still remain moderate impurities in the gold,<br />
					such as fine grit<br />
					and coarse sand.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dirt-washer<br />
					or his man<br />
					repeats the process.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this is abandoned and ended<br />
					there still remain trifling impurities<br />
					such as fine sand<br />
					and black dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dirt-washer<br />
					or his man<br />
					repeats the process.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereafter the gold-dust alone remains.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the goldsmith<br />
					or his man<br />
					heaps that sterling gold<br />
					into a crucible<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					melts it together<br />

					<p class="f4">That sterling gold is then blown till it melts:<br />

					<p class="f4">It is brittle,<br />
					not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> capable of perfect workmanship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a time comes, monks,<br />
					when that goldsmith<br />
					or his man<br />
					blows that gold till it melts,<br />
					melts it down<br />
					and runs it out of the crucible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that sterling gold is melted,<br />

					done with,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is pliable,<br />

					<p class="f4">For whatsoever sort of ornament one wishes,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. Just in the same way<br />
					in a monk who is given to developing the higher consciousness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					there are gross impurities of deed,<br />

					and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">This fault the thoughtful,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> able<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> monk abandons,<br />

					<p class="f4">When this fault is done with<br />

					certain moderately gross impurities<br />
					which cling to him,<br />
					such as sensual reflections,<br />
					malicious<br />
					and cruel reflections.</p>

					<p class="f4">These faults he abandons,<br />

					he makes an end of it,<br />
					he makes it not recur.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this fault is done with<br />
					and made an end of,<br />

					such as reflections about his relatives,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span><br />
					his district,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. When that is done with<br />
					and made an end of,<br />
					there still remain reflections<br />
					about mind-states.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now this sort <a id="pg233"><span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></a> of concentration<br />
					is neither calm nor lofty,<br />
					nor has it gotten tranquillity<br />
					nor reached one-pointedness;<br />
					but it is a state<br />
					dependent on painful habitual restraint.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Yet there comes a time<br />
					when that mind of his<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
					becomes inwardly well established,<br />
					settles down,<br />

					<p class="f4">12. Now, monks, if a monk<br />
