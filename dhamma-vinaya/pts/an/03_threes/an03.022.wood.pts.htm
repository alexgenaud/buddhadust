<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 22. Providing medical treatment to three types of persons is likened to teaching Dhamma to three types of persons. One sort of person will not recover whether he receives treatment or not; one will recover whether he receives treatment or not; and one will recover if he receives treatment, but not if he does not. Similarly one sort of person will not gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; one will gain the path whether he hears Dhamma or not; and one will gain the path if he hears Dhamma and not if he does not. It is for the sake of the sick man who will recover if he receives medical treatment that providing medical treatment for the sick is not useless. Similarly it is for the sake of the one who will gain the path if he hears Dhamma that teaching Dhamma is not useless." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three types of sick men to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a sick man,<br />
					whether he obtain proper diet or not,<br />
					whether he obtain proper medicines or not,<br />
					whether he obtain proper nursing or not,<br />
					does not recover from that sickness of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, maybe a sick man,<br />
					whether he obtain <a id="pg103"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span></a> all these things or not,<br />
					does nevertheless recover from that sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet again, monks, maybe a sick man,<br />
					though he receive not any of these things,<br />
					yet recovers from that sickness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now monks, as to the sick man who gets proper diet or proper medicines or proper nursing and recovers from that sickness (but not in case he fails to get them),<br />
					— with respect to this particular sick man,<br />
					proper diet, medicines and nursing have been prescribed,<br />
					and it is on his particular account<br />
					(owing to his having recovered)<br />
					that other sick men ought to be attended to.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> So then these are the three types of sick men ...</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, there are three types of men to be found in the world who may be compared to these three types of sick men.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks, a certain person,<br />
					whether he get or do not get the chance of seeing the <i>Tathāgata</i>;<br />
					whether he get or do not get the chance of hearing Dhamma-Discipline set forth by the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					— does not enter on the assurance of perfection in conditions that are good.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein again, monks, a certain person,<br />
					whether or no he get the chance of seeing the <i>Tathāgata</i> ...<br />
					does enter on the assurance of perfection in conditions that are good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein yet again, monks a certain person gets,<br />
					does not fail to get,<br />
					the chance of seeing the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					of hearing the Dhamma-Discipline set forth by the <i>Tathāgata</i><br />
					and does enter on the assurance of perfection in conditions that are good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks,it is on account of this last one<br />
					that Dhamma-teaching is proclaimed,<br />
					and it is on his account<br />
					that Dhamma is to be taught to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three types of men to be found in the world<br />
					who may be compared to these three types of sick men."</p>
