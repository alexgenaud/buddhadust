<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 91. The Buddha addresses the anxiousness of the bhikkhus to attain the goal by likening the training to the three basic tasks of the farmer: plowing the field, sowing the seed, and irrigation. In the same way that these three tasks are under the control of the farmer, the training is under the control of the bhikkhu; in the same way as the growth of the crop is out of the hands of the farmer; the time of attaining the goal is out of the hands of the bhikkhu. Nevertheless there is expecation of results in both cases." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three urgent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> duties of a yeoman farmer.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the yeoman farmer<br />
					gets his field well ploughed and harrowed<br />
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done so<br />
					he puts in his seed<br />
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having done that<br />

					and turns it off<br />
					very quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, that yeoman farmer<br />
					has no such magic power or authority<br />
					as to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let my crops spring up today.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow let them ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the following day let them ripen.'</p>

					<p class="f4">No!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the due season<br />
					which makes them do this.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. In the same way<br />
					there are these three urgent duties of a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The undertaking of the training<br />
					in the higher morality,<br />
					in the higher thought<br />
					and in the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are his three urgent duties.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the monk<br />
					has no such magic power or authority<br />
					as to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today let my mind be released from the āsavas without grasping,<br />
					or tomorrow,<br />
					or the day following.'</p>

					<p class="f4">No!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the due season<br />
					which releases his mind,<br />
					as he undergoes the training<br />
					in the higher morality,<br />
					in the higher thought<br />
					and in the higher insight.</p>
