					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are seen to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who longs not,<br />
					he who longs<br />
					and he who has done with longings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs not?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion, monks,<br />
					suppose a certain man is born into a low family,<br />
					the family of a scavenger<br />
					or a hunter<br />
					or a basket-weaver<br />
					or a wheelwright<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or a sweeper,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or in the family of some wretched man<br />
					hard put to it to find a meal<br />
					or earn a living,<br />
					where food and clothes<br />
					are hard to get.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover he is ill-favoured,<br />
					ugly,<br />
					dwarfish,<br />
					sickly,<br />
					purblind,<br />
					crooked,<br />
					lame,<br />
					or paralyzed,<br />
					with never a bite or sup,<br />
					nor any clothes,<br />
					vehicle,<br />
					bed,<br />
					dwelling<br />
					or lights,<br />
					no perfumes<br />
					or flower-garlands.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br />
					has been anointed by the rulers<br />
					with the ruler's consecration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br />
					will the rulers anoint me<br />
					with the ruler's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, monks, is called<br />
					'a person that longs not.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, monks, there is the elder son of a rajah,<br />
					a ruler duly anointed,<br />
					and he is fit to be consecrated,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but has not been,<br />
					and has reached the age of discretion.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br />
					has been anointed by the rulers<br />
					with the ruler's consecration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br />
					will the rulers anoint me<br />
					with the ruler's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a person that longs.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person<br />
					that has done with longings?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> In this connexion, suppose there is a rajah,<br />
					of the ruling caste,<br />
					duly anointed<br />
					with the ruler's consecration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'So and so of the ruling caste<br />
					has been duly anointed<br />
					with the ruler's consecration<br />
					by the rulers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it does not occur to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder<br />
					will the rulers anoint me<br />
					with the rider's consecration?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The longing for consecration<br />
					which he had when he was unanointed<br />
					has utterly ceased in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a person that has done with longings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons<br />
					that are seen to exist in the world</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks,<br />
					these three sorts of monks<br />
					are seen to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one that longs not,<br />
					the one that longs,<br />
					and the one that has done with longings.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain one is immoral,<br />
					an evil-doer,<br />
					impure,<br />
					of suspicious behaviour,<br />
					of covert deeds.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He is no recluse,<br />
					though he pretends to be:<br />
					no liver of the righteous life,<br />
					though he claims to be:<br />
					rotten within and full of lusts,<br />
					a rubbish heap of filth is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					has himself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					myself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a person that longs not.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person that longs?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion we have a monk<br />
					who is moral<br />
					and of a lovely nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					has himself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he thinks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					myself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'a person that longs.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And who, monks, is the person<br />
					that has done with longings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have the arahant,<br />
					destroyer of the <i>āsavas</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">He hears it said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such and such a monk,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					has himself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />

					<p class="f4">But it never occurs to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I wonder shall I,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					myself in this very life<br />
					come to know thoroughly the heart's release<br />
					and re- <a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a> lease by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas</i>,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abide therein?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, monks,<br />
					the longing for release<br />
					which was his when unreleased<br />
					is now allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'the person that has done with longings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the three persons who are found existing in the world."</p>
