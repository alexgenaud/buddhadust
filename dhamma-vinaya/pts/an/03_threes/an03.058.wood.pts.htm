					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now Tikaṇṇa the brahmin came to visit the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat <a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> at one side<br />
					in presence of the Exalted One,<br />
					Tikaṇṇa, the brahmin, sang the praises<br />
					of those brahmins who possess the threefold lore.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">(Then said the Exalted One:)</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, brahmin, they have the threefold lore, those brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">They have it, as you say.</p>

					<p class="f4">But tell me how brahmins describe<br />
					brahmins who have the threefold lore."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, master Gotama,<br />
					a brahmin is well born on both sides,<br />
					of pure descent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> from mother and father<br />
					as far back as seven generations,<br />
					unsmirched,<br />

					the treatise on phonology (as fourth)<br />

					he is a man learned in the idioms<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and the grammar,<br />

					<p class="f4">That, master Gotama,<br />

					a brahmin who has the threefold lore."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, brahmin, this description<br />
					of a brahmin who has the threefold lore is one thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">The description of him who has the threefold lore<br />
					in the discipline of the Ariyan<br />
					is quite another thing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, master Gotama,<br />
					is one the possessor of the threefold lore<br />
					in the discipline of the Ariyan?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well for me if the worthy Gotama would teach me<br />
					according to what method he is so possessed!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, brahmin, do you listen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your mind attentively.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">(§ ii) "Very well, master,"<br />
					replied Tikaṇṇa the brahmin to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> "Herein a monk,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> aloof from sensuality,<br />
					aloof from evil states,<br />
					enters on the first musing<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of solitude,<br />
					zestful<br />
					and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the calming down of thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that one-pointedness of mind,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					that is born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful<br />
					and easeful,<br />
					which is the second musing,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the fading out of zest,<br />
					he abides indifferent,<br />
					mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences ease through the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having entered on the third musing,<br />
					which the Ariyans describe in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who is indifferent and mindful dwells happily,' -</p>

					<p class="f4">he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by the abandoning of ease,<br />
					by the abandoning of discomfort,<br />

					which is neither pleasant nor painful,<br />
					that utter purity of mindfulness<br />

					which is the fourth musing,<br />
					he abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(§ iii) He then, with mind thus composed,<br />

					made pliant and workable,<br />
					fixed and unperturbed,<br />
					(applies and)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> bends down his mind<br />
					to acquiring knowledge of his former births.</p>

					<p class="f4">In divers ways he recalls his former births, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">One birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three, four, five,<br />
					ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br />
					a hundred,<br />
					a thousand,<br />
					a hundred thousand births:<br />
					the various destructions of aeons,<br />
					the various renewals of aeons,<br />
					both the destructions and renewals of eons, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I lived there,<br />
					was named thus,<br />
					was of such a clan,<br />

					was thus supported,<br />
					had such and such pleasant and painful experiences,<br />

					disappeared thence<br />
					and arose elsewhere.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he calls to mind<br />
					in all their specific details,<br />
					in all their characteristics,<br />
					in many various ways,<br />
					his previous states of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> This is the first knowledge be attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br />
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br />
					arisen is the light,<br />
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br />

					and composed in the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">(§ iv) He then, with mind thus composed,<br />
					made pure and translucent,<br />
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br />
					made pliant and workable,<br />
					fixed and unperturbed,<br />
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br />
					to acquiring knowledge of the fall and rise of beings<br />
					from one existence to another.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					he beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again,<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy state,<br />
					gone to a woeful state<br />
					according to their deeds<br />
					(so as to say):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Alas! these worthies,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
					given to the practice of evil deeds,<br />
					of evil words,<br />
					of evil thoughts,<br />
					scoffing at the Noble Ones,<br />
					of perverted views<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their perverted views, -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					on the dissolution of body after death<br />
					arose again in the Waste,<br />
					the Woeful Way,<br />
					the Downfall,<br />
					in Purgatory!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ah, these worthies,<br />
					given to the practice of good deeds,<br />
					of good words,<br />
					of good thoughts,<br />
					not scoffing at the Noble Ones,<br />
					but of sound views<br />
					and reaping the fruits of their sound views, -<br />
					these beings,<br />
					on the dissolution of the body after death<br />
					arose again in the Happy Lot,<br />
					in the Heaven World.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus with the deva-sight,<br />
					purified and surpassing that of men,<br />
					he beholds beings deceasing<br />
					and rising up again,<br />
					beings both mean and excellent,<br />
					fair and foul,<br />
					gone to a happy state,<br />
					gone to a woeful state<br />
					according to their deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second knowledge he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br />
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br />
					arisen is the light,<br />
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and composed in the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">(§ v) He then, with mind thus composed,<br />
					made pure and translucent,<br />
					stainless and with its taints vanished away,<br />
					made pliant and workable,<br />
					fixed and unperturbed,<br />
					(applies and) bends down his mind<br />
					to acquiring knowledge of the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is, the truth that:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes, as it really is:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, thus knowing,<br />
					thus seeing,<br />
					his mind is <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> released from the asava of sensuality:<br />
					his mind is released from the asava of becoming,<br />
					from the asava of nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">By release comes the knowledge that he is released,<br />
					so that he understands:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Destroyed is rebirth,<br />
					lived is the righteous life,<br />
					done is what I had to do,<br />
					there is no more for me of this state of things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third knowledge he attains.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance has vanished,<br />
					knowledge arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone is the darkness,<br />
					arisen is the light,<br />
					as it does for one who abides earnest,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and composed in the self.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Changeless in virtue, shrewd and meditative,<br />
							With mind subdued, one-pointed, tranquillized,<br />
							That sage who, scattering darkness, hath attained<br />
							The threefold lore and routed Death, - men call<br />
							'A blessing both to devas and mankind,'<br />
							'All-vanquisher,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> 'Blest with the threefold lore,'<br />
							'No more bewildered,' 'One become enlightened,'<br />

							Not one so called by men in empty words.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is how one possesses<br />
					the threefold lore<br />

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, master Gotama,<br />
					this one is quite different from the other!</p>

					<p class="f4">Why! master Gotama,<br />

					<a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> who hath it in the discipline of the Ariyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent it is, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if one should raise what is overthrown,<br />
					or show forth what is hidden,<br />
					or point out the way<br />
					to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or hold up a light in the darkness<br />
					so that they who have eyes may behold objects, —<br />

					hath the Norm been set forth by the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span></p>
