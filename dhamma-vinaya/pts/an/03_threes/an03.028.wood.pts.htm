<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 28. The Buddha characterizes three sorts of speech: The one who gives false testimony is like dung; the one who gives true testimony is like flowers; the one who having abandoned harsh speech, abstains from harsh speech, speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and lovable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many, and agreeable to many is like honey." />

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The tricky-tongued,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the fair-spoken<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the tricky-tongued?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is summoned to go before <a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> a court,<br />
					a company or gathering of his relations,<br />
					or a guild,<br />
					or to the royal palace,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Come now, my man,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> say what you know!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, though ignorant, he says that he knows.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Though he knows, he denies all knowledge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Though he was not an eye-witness of the event,<br />
					he says he was.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Though an eye-witness, he denies it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus to shield himself or others,<br />
					or for the sake of some triffling gain,<br />
					he knowingly tells a lie.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the tricky-tongued.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the fair-spoken?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person is summoned to go before a court,<br />

					or a guild,<br />

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called 'the fair-spoken.'</p>					

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the honey-tongued?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a certain person,<br />
					abandoning harsh speech, abstains therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever speech is harmless,<br />
					pleasant to the ear,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					touching the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					delightful to many folk,<br />
					pleasant to many folk<br />
					— such speech he uses.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called 'the honey-tongued.'</p>
