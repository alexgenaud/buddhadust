<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 99. The Buddha illustrates the relativity of kamma using three similies. The repercussions of the same deed for one of undeveloped character and one of developed character are compared to the effects of a small amount of salt on a small amount of water and the effects of the same small amount of salt on a large body of water; and two similies comparing the punishment for a small theft committed by a poor man and the punishment for the same small theft committed by a rich and powerful man." />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4">In this case some person or other<br />

					<p class="f4">What think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that trifling amount of water in the cup<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This does not controvert the doctrine of the deed, but means that the particular kind of action does not find its exact replica in fulfilment, because times and men and things are always changing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Text wrongly joins <i>sammā</i> with <i>dukkhassa</i> throughout, as if it were 'utter' Ill.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Text should read <i>Nāṇum pi khāyati, bahu-d-eva (ne minimum quidem videtur, ne multum dicam),</i> which <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases thus: <i>dutiye attabhāve aṇum pi na khāyati: aṇumattam pi dutiye attabhāve vipākaɱ na deti,</i> 'in his next birth not a jot of it is seen: in his next birth it does not produce even a trifling result. Grimm follows this rendering <i>(loc. cit.)</i> which the Pali may bear, but it does not harmonize with the Gangā simile. Warren gives just the opposite meaning, translating 'not slight, but grievous.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Appa-dukkha-vihārī.</i> The words would ordinarily mean 'he lives in but little pain,' but apparently it is contrasted with <i>appamāṇa-vihārī</i> below.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Mahattā = mahātmā.</i> (<i>Comy.</i> avoids this 'soul' or 'self' idea by saying he is great by his great qualities, though his person be small (?), but in dealing with the next word, <i>appamāṇa-vihārī,</i> admits that he is Arahant.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Kahāpaṇa</i> = ? a farthing. It may be a case of theft or debt; the comparison with the rich man suggests the latter alternative.</p>
