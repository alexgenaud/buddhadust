<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 99. The Buddha illustrates the relativity of kamma using three similies. The repercussions of the same deed for one of undeveloped character and one of developed character are compared to the effects of a small amount of salt on a small amount of water and the effects of the same small amount of salt on a large body of water; and two similies comparing the punishment for a small theft committed by a poor man and the punishment for the same small theft committed by a rich and powerful man." />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if anyone should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, of what sort of being<br />

					<p class="f4">In this case some person or other<br />

					<p class="f4">What think ye, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that trifling amount of water in the cup<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, suppose a man throws a grain of salt<br />

					<p class="f4">"Well, monks, just in the same way<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This sutta is trans. by Warren, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-1_contents.htm"><i>Buddhism in Translations</i></a>, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bit/bit-40.htm#p1">218,</a> and Grimm, <i>The Doctrine of the Buddha,</i> 255.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This does not controvert the doctrine of the deed, but means that the particular kind of action does not find its exact replica in fulfilment, because times and men and things are always changing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Vedanīyaṃ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Text wrongly joins <i>sammā</i> with <i>dukkhassa</i> throughout, as if it were 'utter' Ill.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Text should read <i>Nāṇum pi khāyati, bahu-d-eva (ne minimum quidem videtur, ne multum dicam),</i> which <i>Comy.</i> paraphrases thus: <i>dutiye attabhāve aṇum pi na khāyati: aṇumattam pi dutiye attabhāve vipākaṃ na deti,</i> 'in his next birth not a jot of it is seen: in his next birth it does not produce even a trifling result. Grimm follows this rendering <i>(loc. cit.)</i> which the Pali may bear, but it does not harmonize with the Gangā simile. Warren gives just the opposite meaning, translating 'not slight, but grievous.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Abhāvita.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>App'ātumo</i> ('a small ego'). <i>Comy.</i> <i>ātumo vuccati aitabhāvo, tasmiṃ mahante pi (?) guṇa-parittatāya app'ātumo yeva.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Nid.</i> i, 69 <i>(ātumā vuccati attā).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Appa-dukkha-vihārī.</i> The words would ordinarily mean 'he lives in but little pain,' but apparently it is contrasted with <i>appamāṇa-vihārī</i> below. Warren trans. 'abides in what is finite (?).' Does it mean 'he is a little man and has but little care in the world'?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Mahattā = mahātmā.</i> (<i>Comy.</i> avoids this 'soul' or 'self' idea by saying he is great by his great qualities, though his person be small (?), but in dealing with the next word, <i>appamāṇa-vihārī,</i> admits that he is Arahant.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Kahāpaṇa</i> = ? a farthing. It may be a case of theft or debt; the comparison with the rich man suggests the latter alternative.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The conclusion is that one man is unable to pay off his karma, while the other can do so. The rich man is the one who has more ability and merit.</p>
