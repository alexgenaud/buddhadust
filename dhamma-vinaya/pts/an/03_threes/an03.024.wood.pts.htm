					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are very helpful to another person.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one through whom a person goes for refuge to the Buddha,<br />
					to Dhamma<br />
					and the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is very helpful to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the one through whom one understands,<br />
					as <a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also there is the one through whom a person,<br />
					by destroying the āsavas,<br />
					himself in this very life<br />
					comes to know thoroughly<br />
					the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is freed from the āsavas,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a person is very helpful to one.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three persons that are very helpful to another person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Than these three I declare there is no other more helpful to this person.</p>

					<p class="f4">To these three persons<br />
					I declare one cannot make requital by salutations,<br />
					by rising up in his presence,<br />
					by saluting him with clasped hands,<br />
					by dutiful behaviour<br />
					or by offerings of the requisites of food,<br />
					clothing,<br />
					bed<br />
					and lodging,<br />
					medicines<br />
					and extra delicacies."</p>
