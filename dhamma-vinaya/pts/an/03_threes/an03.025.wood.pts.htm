					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthi at Jeta Grove,<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The one whose mind is like an open sore,<br />
					the lightning-minded<br />
					and the diamond-minded.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Of what sort, monks, is the one whose mind is like an open sore?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person is irritable and turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br />
					no matter how trifling,<br />
					is said to him,<br />
					he becomes enraged,<br />
					he gets angry and quarrelsome:<br />
					he resents it and displays anger,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, for instance,<br />
					when a festering sore,<br />
					if struck by a stick or sherd,<br />
					discharges matter all the more,<br />
					even so, monks, a certain person is irritable and turbulent.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anything,<br />
					no matter how trifling,<br />
					is said to him,<br />
					he becomes enraged,<br />
					he gets angry and quarrelsome:<br />
					he resents it and displays anger,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He whose mind is like an open sore.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the lightning-minded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks,<br />
					a man with good eyesight<br />
					sees objects in the gloom of murky darkness<br />
					by a flash <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> of lightning,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					even so in this case<br />
					a certain person understands,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'He whose mind is like a lightning-flash.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks, is the diamond-minded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					himself in this very life<br />
					comes to know thoroughly<br />
					the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is freed from the āsavas,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, there is nothing,<br />
					whether gem or rock,<br />
					which a diamond cannot cut,<br />
					even so a certain person,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas,<br />
					himself in this very life<br />
					comes to know thoroughly<br />
					the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight<br />
					which is freed from the āsavas,<br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The diamond-minded.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.'</p>
