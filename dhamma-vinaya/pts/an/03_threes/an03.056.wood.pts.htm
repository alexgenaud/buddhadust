<meta name="description" content="The F.L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 56. A wealthy brahmin has heard the story told by the ancients of a time when this world was densely populated and villages and towns and cities grew up right next to each other. He asks Gotama why it is that this is no longer the case and is told that it is because at this time the people are obsessed with lusts, depravities and wrong views resulting in a number of calamaties that depopulate the earth." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain brahmin of great wealth came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him he greeted him courteously<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side<br />
					that brahmin said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> "Master Gotama, I have beard the saying<br />
					of brahmins of olden days,<br />
					men aged,<br />
					far gone in years,<br />
					themselves the teachers of teachers,<br />
					that once upon a time<br />
					this world was in truth so crowded with people, -<br />
					one might think it to be the Waveless Deep,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					that villages,<br />
					suburbs<br />
					and royal cities<br />
					were close enough for a cock to walk from one to another.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, master Gotama,<br />
					what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br />
					of human beings?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is it that villages are no longer villages,<br />
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br />
					towns no longer towns,<br />
					and districts are depopulated?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, brahmin,<br />
					people are ablaze with unlawful lusts,<br />
					overwhelmed by depraved longings,<br />
					obsessed by wrong doctrines.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus ablaze,<br />
					overwhelmed<br />
					and obsessed<br />
					they seize sharp knives<br />
					and take each other's lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus many men come by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is the reason,<br />
					that is the cause<br />

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br />
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br />
					towns no longer towns,<br />
					and districts are depopulated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahmin,<br />

					the sky rains not down steadily.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It is hard to get a meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly many come <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is the reason,<br />
					that is the cause<br />
					of the apparent loss and decrease<br />
					of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br />
					suburbs no longer suburbs,<br />
					towns no longer towns,<br />
					and districts are depopulated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, brahmin, since folk are ablaze with unlawful lusts,<br />
					overwhelmed by depraved longings,<br />
					obsessed by wrong doctrines,<br />
					on such miscreants<br />
					the Yakkhas loose non-human monsters.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby many come by their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, is the reason,<br />

					of human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why villages are no longer villages,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, master Gotama!<br />
					Excellent, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as one raises what is overthrown,<br />
					or shows forth what is hidden,<br />
					or points out the way to him that wanders astray,<br />
					or holds up a light in the darkness,<br />
					that they who have eyes ay see objects, —<br />
					even so in divers ways<br />
					hath the Norm been set forth by the worthy Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, master Gotama,<br />
					do go for refuge to the worthy Gotama,<br />
					to Dhamma<br />
					and to the Order of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the worthy Gotama<br />
