					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was journeying about among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans,</a><br />
					attended by a great company of monks,<br />
					and he came to Venāgapura,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> a brahmin village of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> Now the brahmin housefathers of Venāgapura<br />
					heard the news that Gotama the recluse,<br />
					son of the Sakyans,<br />
					who went forth as a Wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					was come to Venāgapura.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there went abroad<br />
					a fair report about Gotama,<br />
					that Exalted One,<br />
					thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is he,<br />
					that Arahant<br />
					who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					Wellfarer,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">He makes known this world<br />
					together with the world of devas,<br />
					Maras<br />
					and Brahmas,<br />
					together with the host of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					both of devas and mankind,<br />
					having himself come to know it thoroughly for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches Dhamma<br />
					that is lovely in the beginning,<br />
					lovely in the middle,<br />
					lovely in the ending,<br />
					both in letter and spirit;<br />
					in all its fullness<br />
					he preaches the holy life<br />
					that is utterly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well indeed for us<br />
					if we could get the sight<br />
					of arahants such as these."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the brahmin housefathers of Venāgapura<br />
					came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br />
					some saluted the Exalted One<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some greeted the Exalted One,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some raising their joined palms to their foreheads<br />
					in respect to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some proclaimed their name and clan<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">While others,<br />
					without saying anything,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					just sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as he thus sat<br />
					Vacchagotta<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the brahmin of Venāgapura,<br />
					said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "It is wonderful, master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, master Gotama,<br />
					how serene is the worthy Gotama's air,<br />
					how clear and translucent<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> his complexion!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as the yellow <a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> jujube fruit<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> in autumn<br />
					is clear and translucent,<br />
					even so is the worthy Gotama's complexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a palm-tree fruit<br />
					just loosed from the stalk<br />
					is clear and translucent,<br />
					even so is the worthy Gotama's complexion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a trinket of red gold,<br />
					wrought in a crucible by a clever goldsmith,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					deftly beaten<br />
					and laid on a yellow cloth,<br />
					shines and blazes and glitters,<br />
					even so the worthy Gotama's senses are calmed,<br />
					his complexion is clear and translucent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, master Gotama,<br />

					such as the sofa,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Brahmin, as to those couches,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, brahmin, there are these three couches,<br />
					both high and broad,<br />
					which I can get both here and now<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> as I please,<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> They are the high, broad couch celestial,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					high, broad couch sublime,<br />
					and the high, broad couch of the Ariyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three couches<br />
					I get here and now as I please,<br />
					without toil and trouble."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. "Pray, master Gotama,<br />
					of what sort is that high, broad couch celestial<br />
					which the worthy Gotama gets here and now as he pleases<br />
					without toil and trouble?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this case, brahmin,<br />
					when I am living dependent<br />
					on a certain village or suburb,<br />
					I get myself robed in the forenoon,<br />
					and taking bowl and outer robe<br />
					I enter that village or suburb to beg.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I return from my alms-round<br />
					and have eaten my meal,<br />
					I make for the edge of a forest.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There I gather together<br />
					whatever grasses or leaves there are<br />

					holding my body straight<br />
					and setting mindfulness in front of me.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus aloof from sense-desires,<br />
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br />
					I enter on the first musing<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br />
					I enter on that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second musing,<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br />
					I become balanced<br />
					and remain mindful and composed,<br />
					and experience with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and I enter on the third musing<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which I had before,<br />
					I enter and abide in the fourth musing,<br />
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
