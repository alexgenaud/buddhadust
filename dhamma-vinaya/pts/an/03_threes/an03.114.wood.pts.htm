					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three sorts of person are found to exist in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, a certain person,<br />
					by utterly transcending consciousness of form,<br />
					by the disappearance of consciousness of resistance,<br />
					by paying no heed to the diversity of consciousness,<br />
					regarding space as infinite,<br />
					reaches up to and abides in the sphere of infinite space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enjoys it, longs for it and finds happiness therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Established therein,<br />
					given thereto,<br />
					generally spending his time therein<br />
					and not falling away therefrom,<br />
					when he makes an end<br />
					he is reborn in the company<br />
					of the Devas who have reached the sphere of infinite space.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, the life of those Devas is 20,000 cycles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein the ordinary man stays<br />
					and spends his lifetime according to the life-span of those Devas:<br />
					then he goes to Purgatory or to the womb of an animal or to the Realm of Ghosts.</p>
