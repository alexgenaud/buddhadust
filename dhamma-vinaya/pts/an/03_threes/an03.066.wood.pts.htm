<meta name="description" content="The F. L. Woodward translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 66. Old Man Nandako teaches two young brahmins not to go by what is accepted tradition, by hearsay, or great learning, not to go by logic and inference, the appeal of some theory, or because it is held by a venerated teacher, but only when a thing is understood for one's self to be beneficial, blameless, approved of by the wise, things that when done result in happiness and well-being undertake them and live by them." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Nandaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in East Park,<br />
					at the terraced house of Migara's mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sāḷha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Migara's grandson<br />
					and Rohaṇa, Pekhuṇiya's grandson,<br />

					<p class="f4">3. Now what think you, Sāḷha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does greed exist?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It does, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Sāḷha, I call it coveting.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what it means, I declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now does not this covetous man<br />
					slay a being,<br />
					take what is not given,<br />
					go after another's wife,<br />
					tell lies<br />
					and lead another into a state<br />
					that is to his loss for a long time?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Now what think you, Sāḷha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does malice exist?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, I call it malevolence.</p>

					go after another's wife,<br />
					tell lies<br />
					and lead another into a state<br />

					<p class="f4">Does delusion exist?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, Sāḷha, I call it nescience.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Now what think you, Sāḷha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these things profitable or unprofitable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unprofitable, sir"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blamable or not blamable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blamable, sir."</p>
