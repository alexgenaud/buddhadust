					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of three qualities<br />
					a monk is proficient in the practice<br />
					leading to the Sure Course,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and he has strong grounds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					for the destruction of the āsavas.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk keeps watch over the door of his sense faculties<br />
					he is moderate in eating<br />
					and given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> And how does he keep watch over the door of his sense faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, seeing an object with the eye,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the eye uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of eye,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, hearing a sound with the ear,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the ear uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of ear,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, smelling a scent with the none,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the nose uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of nose,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, tasting a savour with the tongue,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the tongue uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of tongue,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, contacting a tangible with the body,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the body uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of body,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk, cognizing a mental state with the mind,<br />
					does not grasp at the general features<br />
					or at the details thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since coveting and dejection, evil, unprofitable states,<br />
					might overwhelm one<br />
					who dwells with the faculty of the mind uncontrolled,<br />
					he applies himself to such control,<br />
					sets a guard over the faculty of mind,<br />
					attains control thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, monks, is how a monk has the door of his faculties guarded.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk moderate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk takes his food thoughtfully and prudently;<br />
					not for sport,<br />
					not for indulgence,<br />
					not for personal charm or adornment,<br />
					but just enough for the support<br />
					and upkeep of the body,<br />
					to allay its pains,<br />
					to help the practice of the holy life,<br />
					with the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'My former feeling I check<br />
					and I set going no new feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">So shall I keep going,<br />
					be blameless<br />
					and live happily.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus a monk is moderate in eating.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a monk given to watchfulness?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, by day<br />
					a monk walks up and down and then sits,<br />
					thus cleansing his heart<br />
					of things that he must check.</p>

					<p class="f4">By night,<br />
					for the first watch<br />
					a monk walks up and down and then sits,<br />
					thus cleansing his heart<br />
					of things that he must check.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the middle watch of the night,<br />
					lying on his right side<br />
					he takes up the lion-posture,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					resting one foot on the other,<br />
					and thus collected and composed<br />
					fixes his thoughts on rising up again.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the last watch of the night,<br />
					at early dawn,<br />
					a monk walks up and down, <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> and then sits,<br />
					and so cleanses his heart<br />
					of things that he must check.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a monk is given to watchfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessed of these three qualities,<br />
					a monk is proficient in the practice<br />
					leading to the Sure Course,<br />
					and he is thorougly set upon<br />
					the destruction of the āsavas.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
