					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One,<br />
					while going his rounds among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans</a><br />
					with a great <a id="pg171"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></a> company of monks, came to Kesaputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> a district of the Kosalans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Kālāmas of Kesaputta heard it said that Gotama the recluse,<br />
					the Sakyans' son who went forth as a wanderer from the Sakyan clan,<br />
					had reached Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this good report was noised abroad about Gotama, that Exalted One, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He it is, the Exalted One,<br />
					Arahant,<br />
					a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					perfect in knowledge and practice,<br />
					Wellfarer,<br />
					world-knower,<br />
					unsurpassed charioteer of men to be tamed,<br />
					teacher of devas and mankind,<br />
					a Buddha,<br />
					an Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It were indeed a good thing to get sight of such arahants!"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Kālāmas of Kesaputta came to see the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching him, some saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side:<br />
					some greeted the Exalted One courteously,<br />
					and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies<br />
					sat down at one side:<br />
					some raising their joined palms to the Exalted One<br />
					sat down at one side:<br />
					some proclaimed their name and clan<br />
					and did likewise;<br />
					while others without saying anything<br />
					just sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then as they thus sat<br />
					the Kālāmas of Kesaputta said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Sir, certain recluses and brahmins come to Kesaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">As to their own view,<br />
					they proclaim and expound it in full:<br />
					but as to the view of others,<br />
					they abuse it,<br />
					revile it,<br />
					depreciate<br />
					and cripple it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, sir, other recluses and brahmins,<br />
					on coming to Kesaputta,<br />
					do likewise.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we listen to them, sir,<br />
					we have doubt and wavering<br />
					as to which of these worthies is speaking truth<br />
					and which speaks falsehood."</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Yes, Kālāmas, you may well doubt,<br />
					you may well waver.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a doubtful matter wavering does arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now look you, Kālāmas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Be ye not misled by report<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or tradition<br />

					<p class="f4">Be not misled by proficiency in the <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> collections,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

					nor because it fits becoming,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					nor out of respect for a recluse (who bolds it).</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Kālāmas, when you know for yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">These things are unprofitable,<br />
					these things are blameworthy,<br />
					these things are censured by the intelligent;<br />
					these things, when performed and undertaken,<br />

					<p class="f4">then indeed do ye reject them, Kālāmas.</p>

					<p class="f4">'To his loss, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "Now what think ye, Kālāmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">When illusion arises within a man,<br />

					<p class="f4">"To his loss, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And does not this man, thus deluded,<br />
					being overcome by delusion<br />

					does he not kill a living creature,<br />

					<p class="f4">Are these things profitable or unprofitable?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Unprofitable, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are they blameworthy or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Blameworthy, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are they censured by the intelligent or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are censured, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If performed and undertaken,<br />
					do they conduce to loss and sorrow or not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They conduce to loss and sorrow, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just so, me-thinks."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "So then, Kālāmas, as to my words to you just now:</p>

					<p class="f4">15. Now, Kālāmas, he who is an Ariyan disciple<br />

					with a heart possessed by compassion,<br />
					with a heart possessed by sympathy,<br />
