<meta name="description" content="F.L. Woodward's translation of Aṅguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 90. While listening to the Buddha speak about the training rules, Kassapa bhikkhu thinks that Gotama goes too far along the lines of strict behavior. After the Buddha departs he has second thoughts and suffers regret mightily. He quickly goes to the Buddha to reveal his error. The revelation is acknowledged and he is given a teaching explaining the importance of being a good example." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosalans</a><br />
					together with a great company of monks,<br />
					and on coming to Pankadhā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a district of the Kosalans,<br />
					there abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Now Pankadhā is a district of the Kosalans.)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion<br />
					a certain monk named Kassapa,<br />
					of the Kassapa clan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					was resident at Pankadhā,<br />
					and it happened that the Exalted One was instructing,<br />
					inciting<br />
					and gladdening the monks<br />
					with a religious talk<br />
					suitable to the keeping of the <a id="pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa,<br />
					while the Exalted One was tbus engaged,<br />
					did not approve,<br />
					was dissatisfied (and kept thinking):</p>

					<p class="f4">"This recluse is much too scrupulous."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">2. So the Exalted One,<br />
					after staying at Pankadhā as long as he wished,<br />
					set forth on his rounds towards <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a><br />
					and on arrival<br />
					took up his quarters there<br />

					on Vultures' Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk Kassapa<br />
					of the Kassapa clan,<br />
					not long after the departure of the Exalted One,<br />
					felt remorse and regret,<br />
					thinking:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a loss to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed no gain to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is ill-gotten by me!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed a thing<br />

					suitable to the keeping of the precepts,<br />
					I did not approve<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br />

					were to explain my transgression to him as such."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. So the monk Kassapa<br />
					of the Kassapa clan<br />
					set his lodging in order,<br />
					took bowl and outer robe<br />
					and set off for Rājagaha<br />
					and thence to where the Exalted One was staying<br />
					on Vultures' Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br />
					he saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					Kassapa the monk said this<br />
					to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br />
					the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Kosalans<br />

					<p class="f4">'This recluse is much too scrupulous.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose now I were to go to see the Exalted One,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> Transgression, lord, overcame me,<br />

					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One, lord,<br />

					to be a restraint upon me in the future."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "Verily, Kassapa, transgression overcame you,<br />
					such was your folly,<br />
					your infatuation,<br />
					your wrong-doing,<br />
					in that,<br />
					while I was instructing,<br />
					inciting<br />

					<p class="f4">Yet, Kassapa,<br />
					since you have seen your transgression as such<br />
					and made confession as is right,<br />
					we do accept this of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Growth verily, Kassapa, is this<br />
					in the discipline of an Ariyan,<br />
					when, having seen one's transgression as such,<br />
					he makes confession thereof as is right,<br />
					and in future practises self-restraint.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now, Kassapa,<br />
					if an elder monk be not desirous of the training,<br />
					if he speak not in praise<br />
					of undertaking the training,<br />
					and if other monks also<br />
					are not desirous of the training<br />
					and he do not incite them to undertake it,<br />
					and if he speak not in praise thereof<br />
					what is true and real<br />
					at the proper time<br />
					to those monks who are desirous of the training, -<br />
					of such an elder monk, Kassapa,<br />
					I utter no praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because other monks would keep company with him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master speaks in praise of him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those who should keep company with him<br />
					would come to share his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br />
					I speak not in praise of such an elder monk.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Again, Kassapa, if a monk of middle standing be not desirous of the training,<br />
					if he speak not in praise<br />
					of undertaking the training,<br />
					and if other monks also<br />
					are not desirous of the training<br />
					and he do not incite them to undertake it,<br />

					what is true and real<br />
					at the proper time<br />

					I utter no praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br />

					<p class="f4">If likewise a novice be not desirous of the training,<br />

					<p class="f4">7. But, Kassapa, if an elder monk be desirous of the training,<br />
					if he speak in praise of undertaking the training,<br />
					if he incite other monks,<br />
					not so desirous,<br />
					to undertake it,<br />
					if he speak in praise of it<br />

					at the proper <a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> time<br />

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because other monks would keep company with him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Master praises him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now they who should keep company with him<br />
					would come to share his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they should do so<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">8. Again, Kassapa, if a monk of middle standing be desirous of the training,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Kassapa,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, Kassapa, if a novice monk be desirous of the training,<br />
