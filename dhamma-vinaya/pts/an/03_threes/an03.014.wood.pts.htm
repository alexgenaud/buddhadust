					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br />
					a just and righteous ruler, -<br />
					even he is not without a rajah."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who then, lord, is ruler over a world-monarch,<br />
					a just and righteous ruler?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhamma, monk," replied the Exalted One,<br />
					and went on to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Herein, monk, a rajah who is a world-monarch,<br />
