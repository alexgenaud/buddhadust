					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.087.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>]</span> Thus have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this recital to be made twice a month<br />
					amounts to more than one hundred and fifty rules<br />
					wherein are trained<br />
					clansmen who are eager for their welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now all these combine together<br />
					to make these three forms of training.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher morality,<br />
					the higher thought<br />
					and the higher insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein are combined<br />
					one and all of these rules.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, Monks, in this matter<br />
					a monk keeps the laws of morality in full,<br />
					he practises concentration in full,<br />
					he practises the acquiring of insight in full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever minor, trifling observances<br />
					he may transgress,<br />
					he is cleared of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not declare him<br />
					to be rendered unfit because of them,<br />
					for he strictly observes<br />
					the rudiments of the holy life,<br />
					the constituents of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">He is established in morality,<br />
					he trains himself in the rules of training<br />
					by undertaking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an one, by destroying the āsavas,<br />
					in this very life himself comes to know<br />
					thoroughly the heart's release,<br />
					the release by insight,<br />
					and attaining it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Yet if he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br />
					he attains release midway.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br />
					he wins release by reduction of his time.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br />
					he wins release without much trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br />
					he wins release with some little trouble.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">If he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind (to the lower worlds)<br />
					he wins release he is one who goes upstream<br />
					who goes to the Pure Abodes.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not that,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					yet by destroying three fetters<br />
					and weakening those of lust,<br />
					malice<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					he is a once-returner:<br />
					once more coming back to this world<br />
					he makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, if he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by destroying three fetters<br />
					he is a "one-seeder":<br />
					he takes just one birth as a man<br />
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					yet by destroying three fetters<br />
					he is reborn in a good family:<br />
					he fares and wanders up and down<br />
					in two or three families<br />
					and makes an end of III.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if he attain not,<br />
					if he penetrate not so far as that,<br />
					by the destruction of three fetters<br />
					he is destined to seven more births at most:<br />
					he fares and wanders up and down<br />
					among devas<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and mankind<br />
					seven times at most<br />
					and then makes an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, he who observes in full<br />
					attains in full:<br />
					he who observes partially<br />
					attains partially.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not barren of result<br />
					are the rules of the training,<br />
					I declare."</p>
