<meta name="description" content="The F. L. Woodward translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 72. A householding follower of the Ajivaka's asks Ānanda about whose doctrine is taught best, who are those who are conducting themselves the best, who are those who are of benefit to the world. Ānanda avoids the trap and speaks only of what doctrine is the best, whether or not those who follow it are well conducted, and whether or not those who follow it are of benefit to the world. Further, the way he speaks of these issues is not by telling the housefather what is what, but by asking the housefather questions getting him to convince himself. The housefather is impressed and becomes a follower of the Buddha." />

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī,</a> in Ghosita Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain housefather, <a id="pg197"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span></a> who was a follower of an ascetic mendicant,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to see the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to bim<br />
					he greeted him and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">So seated<br />
					he said this to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, housefather, in this matter<br />
					I will put you a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you answer my question<br />
					as you think fit.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They who preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of passion,<br />
					they who preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of malice<br />
					they who preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of delusion, —<br />

					<p class="f4">How think you of this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The doctrine of they who preach<br />
					the abandoning of passion,<br />
					the doctrine of they who preach<br />
					the abandoning of malice<br />
					the doctrine of they who preach<br />

					<p class="f4">That is my opinion."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "Now what think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They who so conduct themselves<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "Now what think you, housefather?</p>

					<p class="f4">They whose passion is abandoned,<br />

					<p class="f4">"They whose passion is abandoned,<br />

					<p class="f4">4. 'Then you have admitted this much:</p>

					<p class="f4">They whose passion is abandoned,<br />

					<p class="f4">"It is wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is no trumpeting of one's own creed,<br />
					no depreciation of another's <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> creed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					but just teaching of Dhamma<br />
					in its proper sphere.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">You have spoken of (man's) welfare,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Now you yourself, worthy Ānanda,<br />
					preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of passion,<br />
					preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of malice<br />
					preach a doctrine<br />
					for the abandoning of delusion<br />
					and your doctrine is well preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">You conduct yourself<br />
					so as to abandon passion,<br />
					you conduct yourself<br />
					so as to abandon malice<br />
					you conduct yourself<br />
					so as to abandon delusion, —<br />
					and you are well conducted in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">In you, worthy Ānanda, passion is abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made such as not to become,<br />
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br />
					malice is abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made such as not to become,<br />
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time;<br />
					delusion is abandoned,<br />
					cut down at the root,<br />
					made like a palm-tree stump,<br />
					made such as not to become,<br />
					of a nature not to spring up again in future time,<br />
					surely you are a well-farer in the world.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">6. Excellent, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if one should raise the fallen,<br />
					open up what is hidden,<br />
					point out the way<br />
					to one gone astray,<br />
					hold up a shining light<br />
					so that they who have eyes<br />
					may see forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus has Dhamma been expounded<br />
					by the worthy Ānanda<br />
					in divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, worthy Ānanda,<br />
					do go for refuge to the Buddha,<br />
					to Dhamma,<br />
					to the Order of Monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let master Ānanda accept me<br />
					as a lay-follower<br />
					from this day forth<br />
					so long as life shall last<br />
					as one who has so taken refuge."</p>
