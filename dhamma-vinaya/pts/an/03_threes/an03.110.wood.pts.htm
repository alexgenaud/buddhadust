					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

							<p>"(which prevents the arising)" This is a mistake. There are actions which arise abscent lust, etc., for example the not doing of an action based on lust, etc. That too is <i>kamma</i> and is the point of the sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Desire for things<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And how, monks, is desire for things<br />
					which in the past<br />
					were based on desire,<br />

					<p class="f4">One fully understands<br />

					<p class="f4">Foreseeing this result<br />

					one penetrates it by insight<br />

					which are based on desire.</p>

					for things present,<br />
					which are based on desire,<br />

					<p class="f4">One fully understands<br />

					of present things,<br />

					<p class="f4">Foreseeing this result<br />
