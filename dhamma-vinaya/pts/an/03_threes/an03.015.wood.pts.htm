					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Isipatana in the Deer Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks,<br />
					there was a rajah named Pacetana.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now one day the rajah Pacetana said to his wheelwright:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master wheelwright, six months hence<br />
					there will be a battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can you make me a new pair of wheels,<br />
					master wheelwright?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I can, your honour,'<br />
					replied the wheelwright to the rajah Pacetana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, when six months,<br />
					less six days,<br />
					were gone,<br />
					he had finished but one wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the rajah to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master wheelwright,<br />
					six days hence there will be a battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the new pair of wheels complete?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your honour, during these six months,<br />
					less six days,<br />
					one wheel is finished.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But can you finish the second wheel<br />
					in six days?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> 'I can, your honour,'<br />
					rephed the wheelwright.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Well, monks, in six days<br />
					finishing the second wheel<br />
					he took the new pair of wheels<br />
					and went off to see the rajah Pacetana.</p>

					<p class="f4">On getting there he said this to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here's the new pair of wheels finished, your honour.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master wheelwright,<br />
					I see no difference,<br />
					no difference at all<br />
					between the two wheels,<br />
					the one you took six months,<br />
					less six days,<br />
					to make,<br />
					and the one you finished in six days.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But there is a difference, your honour.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your honour look!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, monks,<br />
					the wheelwright set rolling<br />
					the wheel he had finished in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wheel kept rolling<br />
					so long as the impulse that set it moving lasted.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then it circled round and round<br />
					and fell to the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he set rolling<br />
					the wheel which he had finished in six months,<br />
					less six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">It kept rollng<br />
					so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br />
					and then stood still, -<br />
					stuck to the axle,<br />
					you would have thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'But, master wheelwright,' said the rajah,<br />
					'what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause<br />
					why the wheel you made in six days<br />
					rolled on while the impulse lasted,<br />
					then circled round and round<br />
					and fell to the ground:<br />
					whereas the one you made in six months,<br />
					less six days,<br />
					stood still, -<br />
					stuck to the axle,<br />
					you would have thought?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your honour, as to the wheel I finished in six days,<br />
					its rim was crooked,<br />
					full of faults and flaws:<br />
					so were the spokes and hub.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the crooked,<br />
					faulty,<br />
					flawed nature<br />
					of rim,<br />
					spokes<br />
					and hub,<br />
					when set rolling<br />
					it went on so long as the impulse that set it going lasted,<br />
					then circled and fell to the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, your honour, as to the wheel I took six months,<br />
					less six days,<br />
					to finish,<br />
					its rim was not crooked;<br />
					it was faultless,<br />
					flawless:<br />
					so were the spokes and hub.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the even,<br />
					faultless,<br />
					flawless nature<br />
					of rim,<br />
					spokes<br />
					and hub,<br />
					the wheel set rolling<br />
					rolled on so long as the impulse that set <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> it moving lasted,<br />
					then it stood still,-<br />
					stuck to the axle,<br />
					you would have thought.'</p>

					<p class="f4">4. Now, monks, maybe you are thinking<br />
					that on that occasion<br />
					that wheelwright was someone else.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you must not so think.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself was that wheelwright<br />
					on that occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, monks, I was an expert in wood<br />
					that was crooked,<br />
					full of faults<br />
					and flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I,<br />
					the Arahant,<br />
					who am a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					am expert in the crooked ways,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am an expert in the crooked ways,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. Monks, in whatsoever monk or nun<br />
					the crookedness of body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					is not abandoned, -<br />
					such fall<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> away from this Dhamma-Discipline,<br />
					just like the wheel<br />
					that was finished in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whatsoever monk or nun<br />
					the crookedness of body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					is abandoned, -<br />
					such are firm-set in this Dhamma-Discipline,<br />
					just like the wheel<br />
					that was finished in six months,<br />
					less six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, monks,<br />
					thus must ye train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will abandon the crookedness,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of body.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon the crookedness,<br />
					the faults<br />
					and flaws<br />
					of thought.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how ye must train yourselves, monks."</p>
