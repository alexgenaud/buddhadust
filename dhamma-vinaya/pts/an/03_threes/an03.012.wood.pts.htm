					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three things must be borne in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives,<br />
					by a rajah,<br />
					a duly anointed ruler.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is the place where the rajah,<br />
					the duly anointed ruler,<br />
					was born.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the second thing he must bear in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives,<br />
					is the place where he was anointed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the third thing he must bear in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives,<br />
					is the place where he won a battle,<br />
					the place which he occupies as conqueror in the fight.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three things which must be borne in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives,<br />
					by a rajah,<br />
					a duly anointed ruler.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner, monks,<br />
					these three things<br />
					must be borne in mind by a monk,<br />
					so long as he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The place where he got his hair and beard shaved off,<br />
					donned the saffron robes<br />
					and went forth a wanderer<br />
					from home to the homeless life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the first thing he must bear in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks,<br />
					the second thing he must bear in mind by a monk,<br />
					so long as he lives<br />
					is the place where he realized,<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					the meaning of:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the arising of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ceasing of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the practice that leads to the ending of Ill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, monks, the third thing<br />
					he must bear in mind,<br />
					so long as he lives,<br />
					is the place where,<br />
					by the destruction of the <i>āsavas,</i><br />
					he himself in this very life<br />
					came to know thoroughly<br />
					the heart's release and release by insight,<br />
					that is without <i>āsavas,</i><br />
					and having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three things, monks,<br />
					must be borne in mind by a monk,<br />
					so long as he lives."</p>
