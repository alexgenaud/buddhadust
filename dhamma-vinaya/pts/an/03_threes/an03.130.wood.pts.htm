					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied,<br />
					and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, these three persons are found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is like carving on a rock,<br />
					he who is like carving on the ground,<br />
					and he who is like carving on water.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is he who is like carving on a rock?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br />
					is always getting angry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover that anger of his lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a rock-carving<br />
					is not soon erased<br />
					by wind<br />
					or water<br />
					or by lapse of time,<br />
					even so is the anger of him<br />
					that is always getting angry,<br />
					and his anger lasts long.</p>

					<p class="f4">This person is called<br />
					'one like carving on a rock.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is he who is like carving on the ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person<br />
					is always getting angry,<br />
					but his anger lasts not long.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a tracing on the ground<br />
					is soon erased<br />
					by wind<br />
					or water<br />
					or by lapse of time,<br />
					even so is the anger of him<br />
					that is always getting angry,<br />
					but whose anger lasts not long.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one, monks, is called<br />
					'one like carving on the ground.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. And of what sort, monks,<br />
					is he who is like carving on water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain person,<br />
					though he be harshly<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> spoken to,<br />
					sharply spoken to,<br />
					rudely spoken to,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as what is carved on water<br />
					soon disappears<br />
					and lasts not long,<br />
					even so, monks,<br />
					here we have a certain person<br />
					who, though harshly spoken to<br />
					sharply spoken to,<br />
					rudely spoken to,<br />
					yet is he easily reconciled,<br />
					he becomes agreeable and friendly.</p>

					<p class="f4">This one is called<br />
