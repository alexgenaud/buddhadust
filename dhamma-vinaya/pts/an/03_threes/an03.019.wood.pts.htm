					<p class="f4">"Monks, possessed of three characteristics<br />

					of holding what he gets,<br />
					or increasing what he holds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, monks, the shopkeeper<br />
					at early dawn attends not closely to his work,<br />

							<p>This is '<i>Samādhi-nimittaɱ.</i>', a compound, not <i>'nimittaɱ.'.</i> This would necessitate the translaltion: samadhi-reflex image, [or per Woodward: meditation-reflex image, or the more usual 'concentration-reflex image] or some sort of reflex image of the state one is attempting to achieve which would require it to be had before the thing being done to acquire it. The idea here is 'sign' or 'indication'. Some mechanism with which the access to serenity has been previously attained. Think of 'signs' seen by the 'tracker' to 'track-down' his quarry.</p>
