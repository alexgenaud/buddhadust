						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p>A nidana of some sort has frequently, but irregularly been inserted for this digital edition where each sutta should be able to stand alone and where the abrupt launching into a talk is jarring. Picking up the nidana of the first sutta in a chapter for the rest appears called for where the following suttas begin with 'Atha kho', 'There then'. Otherwise from the context and location of certain characters it is possible to deduce the nidana. Otherwise a generic beginning not specifying location has often, but not always been inserted.</p>
