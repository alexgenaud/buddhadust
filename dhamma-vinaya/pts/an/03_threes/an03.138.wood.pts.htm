The Buddha compares the qualities of speed, beauty and good proportions in a thoroughbred to the bhikkhu's having destroyed the five yokes to rebirth in the lower worlds, his ability to answer questions about the deep meaning of the Dhamma and Discipline, and his ease in getting the necessities of life." />

					<p class="f4">Once the Exalted One was dwelling near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī.</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," they replied, and the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you<br />
					the three thoroughbreds<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> among steeds<br />
					and the three human thoroughbreds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do ye listen to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apply your minds earnestly<br />
					and I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, monks, what are the three thoroughbreds among steeds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a certain thoroughbred<br />
					is gifted with speed,<br />
					but not gifted with beauty,<br />
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein also a thoroughbred<br />
					is gifted with speed,<br />
					gifted with beauty,<br />
					but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain thoroughbred<br />
					gifted with speed,<br />
					gifted with beauty,<br />
					and gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of thoroughbred.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now, monks, what are the three human thoroughbreds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human thoroughbred<br />
					gifted with speed,<br />
					but not gifted with beauty,<br />
					not with gifted good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein we have a certain human thoroughbred<br />
					gifted with speed,<br />
					gifted with beauty,<br />
					but not gifted with good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise we have a certain human thoroughbred<br />
					gifted with speed,<br />
					gifted with beauty,<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now how is a human thoroughbred<br />
					gifted with speed<br />
					but not gifted with beauty,<br />
					not gifted with good proportions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein a monk,<br />
					by destroying the five fetters<br />
					that bind to the lower worlds,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is reborn spontaneously,<br />
					there finally to pass away;<br />
					his nature is to return from that world no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'speed'.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he be asked a question<br />
					about extra doctrine<br />
					or extra discipline,<br />
					he falters,<br />
					he cannot solve it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This failure I call his 'lack of beauty.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose that he fails to get offerings<br />
					of robes and alms-food,<br />
					lodging,<br />
					extras<br />
					and necessary medicines.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus we have among men<br />
					a thoroughbred gifted with speed,<br />
					but not gifted in beauty<br />
					and not gifted in good proportions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I call his 'lack of good proportions.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg269"><span class="f2 g"><b>[269]</b></span></a> 5. And how is a human thoroughbred<br />
