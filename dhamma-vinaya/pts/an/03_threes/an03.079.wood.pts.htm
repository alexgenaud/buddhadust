					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī,</a><br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Ānanda went to see the Exalted One,<br />
					and on coming to him<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there are these three sorts of scents<br />
					whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br />
					but not against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Root-scent,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					heart-wood scent<br />
					and the scent of flowers.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three sorts of scents<br />
					whose savour spreads along with the wind,<br />
					but not against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, lord, is there any sort of scent<br />
					whose savour spreads with the wind,<br />
					against the wind<br />
					and both ways alike?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is such a scent, Ānanda."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is that scent, lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "In this connexion, Ānanda,<br />
					in whatsoever village or district<br />

					who abstains from slaying,<br />

					wrong practice in sensual lust,<br />

					who is open-handed,<br />
					pure-handed,<br />
					delighting in giving up,<br />
