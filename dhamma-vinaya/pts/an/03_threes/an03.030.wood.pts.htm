					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three persons<br />
					found existing in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The topsy-turvy-brained,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

							Keeps it, with best intent, unwavering,<br />
							In Dhamma skilled and what conforms thereto.<br />
							This is the man to make an end of Ill.</p>
