					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these three deva-messengers.</p>

					<p class="f4">What three?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this connexion<br />

					<p class="f4">Come, let me act nobly in deed,<br />

					<p class="f4">4. Then, monks, having examined him,<br />

					and addressed him<br />
					concerning the third deva-messenger, Yama, lord of death,<br />
					is silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks,<br />
					the warders of Purgatory<br />
					torture him with the fivefold pinion.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">They drive a hot iron pin<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereat he suffers grievous,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the warders of Purgatory<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Next they place him<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereat he suffers grievous,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they bind him to a chariot<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereat he suffers grievous,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they push him up and down<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereat he suffers grievous,<br />

					<p class="f4">There he is cooked,<br />

					<p class="f4">So doing,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thereat he suffers agonies<br />

					yet he makes not an end<br />
					until that evil deed of his<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, monks,<br />
					the warders of Purgatory<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, this Great Hell<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> (is thus described):</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Four-square the Great Hell standeth, with four gates<br />
							Divided and partitioned, with a wall<br />
							Of iron girt. Of iron is the roof,<br />
							Its floor of iron too, dazzling and hot,<br />
							And, flashing all around a hundred leagues,<br />
							Stands fast for evermore immovable.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">5. Once upon a time, monks,<br />
					Yama, lord of death,<br />
					thought thus to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'True it is, methinks,<br />
					that they who in the world<br />
					do evil deeds in divers ways<br />
					thus suffer retribution.</p>

					<p class="f4">O that I could win birth<br />
					as a human being!</p>

					<p class="f4">O that a Tāthagata<br />
					were born into the world,<br />
					an Arahant<br />
					who is a Fully Enlightened One!</p>

					<p class="f4">O that I might sit at the feet<br />
					of that Exalted One<br />
					and then that Exalted One would teach me Dhamma,<br />
					and then I might learn Dhamma<br />
					from that Exalted One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, monks, I say this,<br />
					not hearing it from some recluse or brahmin;<br />
					nay, but what I myself have known<br />
					and seen<br />
					and heard,<br />
					that do I declare unto you."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">They who, by deva-messengers tho' warned,<br />
							Are proudly<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> careless and indifferent,<br />
							Born in a mean estate, must suffer long.<br />
							Good men, by deva-messengers when warned,<br />
							Are never slothful in the Ariyan Dhamma;<br />
							Seeing the risk of clinging to this world,<br />
							Knowing it for the cause of birth and death,<br />
							By ending birth and death, freed utterly,<br />
							They have won calm, those happy ones,<br />
							Have won Nibbāna in this very life:<br />
