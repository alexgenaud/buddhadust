					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the venerable Ānanda was staying near <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī,</a><br />
					in Great Grove,<br />
					at the House with the Peaked Gable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Abhaya<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and Paṇḍitakumāraka, the <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Licchavīs,</a><br />
					came to visit the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">On coming to him<br />
					they saluted him<br />
					and sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they thus sat,<br />
					Abhaya the Licchavī said this<br />
					to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sir, Nātha's son, the Unclothed,<br />
					claims to be all-knowing,<br />
					all-seeing,<br />
					and to have all-comprising<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He says,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whether I walk<br />
					or stand<br />
					or sleep<br />
					or wake,<br />
					my knowledge and vision<br />
					are always and without a break<br />
					present before me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He proclaims the making an end of former deeds<br />
					by ascetic practice,<br />
					and the breaking down of<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> the power of fresh deeds<br />
					by inaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus by the destruction of deeds<br />
					will result the destruction of Ill:<br />
					by the destruction of Ill,<br />
					the destruction of feeling:<br />
					by the destruction of feeling<br />
					all Ill will be exhausted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So by this visible process<br />
					one passes beyond (the round of existence).<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">What, sir, does the Exalted One say about this?"</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> 2. "Abhaya, these three ways<br />

					that Arahant who is a Fully Enlightened One,<br />
					for the cleansing of beings,<br />
					for their crossing beyond sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					for the destruction of grief and woe,<br />
					for the winning of the Method,<br />
					for the realizing of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Abhaya, a monk is virtuous,<br />
					restrained with the restraint of the obligations;<br />
					proficient in following the practice of right conduct<br />
					he sees danger in the slightest faults:<br />
					he takes up and trains himself<br />
					in the rules of morality.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p><i><b>"he makes an end of former action which has affected him"</b></i> is: <i>Purāṇañ ca kammaɱ phussa phussa vyantīkaroti.</i> And he removes past kamma by way of touch touch. Repeated contact. There is no explanation in the sutta, and the various translations do not explain well. The idea is that by continuously examining the body, sensations, mental states and the Dhamma and dredging up in memory deeds said and done in the past and examining them from the perspective of Dhamma as it is currently understood [the point of satipatthana, and an evolving process] one is in effect experiencing the consequences of one's past deeds. At this point by understanding the deed in terms of ethical conduct, the detachment of <i>jhāna</i> and by seeing the freedom in the destruction of the corrupting influences [<i>āsava</i>] the deed is resolved and swept away.<br />
							Understanding this in this way one is able to resolve the paradox presented by the statement made that there is no ending of kamma without experiencing the results thereof, and the case of Arahants apparently being subjected to the consequences of prior bad kamma as in the cases of Devadatta being able to injure the Buddha's toe, Moggliana being murdered, and Angulimala being subjected to assalt.<br />
							How?<br />
							By ethical conduct, the calm detached serenity of <i>jhāna,</i> and insight into the freedom that results from the destruction of the corrupting influences of lust, hate, and stupidity [<i>āsavas</i>] it is possible to become arahant before the ending of kamma. The Arahant is, by this behavior and insight, subject to no further births after death. That is what distinguishes Arahantship in this life from pari-Nibbāna, and what is meant by the term 'with remainder' when speaking of arahants and non-returners who must experience some delay after death before attaining Nibbāna. Those consequences of former deeds that remain to the Arahant, however far back in time they may have begun, are forced, because their scope is limited to the khandhas, (that is, the individuality,) into presenting themselves within the narrow limit of the life of the Arahant that remains. Thus they are experienced, but in proportion to the relationship of the finite life remaining to the unbounded scope of Nibbāna.  A similar thing occurs for the Streamwinner, Once-returner, and Non-returner.</p>

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the (first way of) cleansing<br />

					a visible process,<br />
					not a matter of time,<br />

					that leads onwards (to the Goal),<br />
					to be understood by the intelligent<br />
					each for himself.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Abhaya, that monk, thus possessed of morality, aloof from sensual desires,<br />
					aloof from unprofitable states of mind,<br />
					enters on the first musing<br />
					which is accompanied by thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of seclusion,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by calming down thought directed and sustained,<br />
					he enters on that inward calm,<br />
					that single-minded purpose,<br />
					apart from thought directed and sustained,<br />
					born of mental balance,<br />
					zestful and easeful,<br />
					which is the second musing,<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then by the fading out of zest<br />
					he becomes balanced<br />
					and remains mindful and composed,<br />
					and experiences with the body<br />
					that happiness of which the Ariyans aver:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The balanced, thoughtful man lives happily,'</p>

					<p class="f4">and he enters on the third musing<br />
					and abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, by rejecting pleasure and pain alike,<br />
					by the coming to an end<br />
					of the joy and sorrow which he had before,<br />
					he enters and abides in the fourth musing,<br />
					free of pain and free of pleasure,<br />
					a state of perfect purity<br />
					of balance and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br />
					he makes an end of former action<br />
					which has affected him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the (second way of) cleansing<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then again, Abhaya, that monk, thus possessed morality,<br />
					concentration<br />
					and insight,<br />
					by the destruction of the āsavas<br />
					himself having come to know<br />
					thoroughly in this very life<br />
					the heart's release<br />
					and the release by insight<br />
					which is free from the āsavas,<br />
					having attained it<br />
					abides therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">He performs no fresh action,<br />
					he makes an end of former action<br />
					which has affected him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the (third way of) cleansing<br />
					by wearing out,<br />
					a visible process,<br />
					not a matter of time,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Abhaya, are the three ways<br />
