					<p class="f4">"Yes, Lord," replied those monks to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once upon a time, monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br />
					was instructing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> the Devas of the Thirty-Three,<br />
					and on that ocoasion uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'He who would be like unto me should keep<br />
							The fourteenth, fifteenth day and eke the eighth<br />
							Of the half-month, likewise the extra fast,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							To observance of the precepts eight well given.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But, monks, this verse was ill sung,<br />
					not well sung<br />
					by Sakka, lord of the Devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was wrongly,<br />
					not rightly uttered.</p>

					<p class="f4">How so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Monks, Sakka, lord of the Devas,<br />
					was not rid of passion,<br />
					not rid of malice,<br />
					not rid of delusion:<br />
					whereas a monk who is arahant,<br />

					<p class="f4">Why so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that monk is rid of passion,<br />
					rid of malice,<br />
					rid of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, monks, Sakka,<br />
