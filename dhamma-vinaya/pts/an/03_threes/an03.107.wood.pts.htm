							<p><i>Nidānās</i>, something from which something originates, begins — not cause. Down-bound: things to which <i>kamma</i> is bound. If lust were a cause, it would always cause, there would be no escape from <i>kamma.</i> Lust arises and is intentionally abandoned, got rid of, exterminated, ended, understood to such a degree as to cause detachment from it, to stop it in it's tracks, to see it coming before it arises and thereby to end <i>kamma.</i></p>
