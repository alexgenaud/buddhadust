					<h1>Appendix on Soḷasī</h1>

					<p class="f4">The phrase <i>kalaɱ n'agghati soḷasiɱ,</i> 'is not worth one sixteenth part of,' at <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/10_tens/an10.119.wood.pts.htm#fn6">p. 171</a>, occurs fairly often in the Pāli Tipiṭakas - <i>e.g.,</i> at <i>S.</i> iii, 156; v, 44, 343; <i>Dhp.,</i> 70; <i>It.</i> 19; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/08_eights/an08.042.pali.bd.htm"><i>A.</i> iv, 252</a> and elsewhere. Why was this particular fraction used to express a minute value? It is common in Skt. works <i>(shoḍacī),</i> early and late [the late <i>Jātakamāla,</i> xli, has 'the 16 parts (phases) of the moon], and it became a conventional number, perhaps owing to the Sānkhyan system of subdividing. I have found a number of passages which I give here, (a) to show a similar use, and (6) the ideas from which this use probably arose.</p>

					<p class="f4">(a) <i>Mahābh. Moksh. Dh.,</i> § 276, 6.	'Happiness here and in heaven equals not even one sixteenth of the happiness of the utter vanishing of desire.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib., Sabha P.</i> 41. 'Worship, gifts, study, all equal not in merit one sixteenth part of that won by having a son.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib., Vana P.</i> 91.	'In battle Karna equals not even one sixteenth of Pritha's son.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib., V.P.</i> 189.	'Then the life of men will be reckoned as of sixteen years.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(b) The Vedanta reckoning of the psychic organs is sixteenfold. <i>Cf., Shatap. Br.</i> x, 4.11,17.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>B.r. Aran. Up. Brāh.</i> i, 14.	'That	Prajāpati in his likeness to the year is of sixteen parts <i>(kaḷā)</i>. His nights fifteen parts; his fixed part is the sixteenth. Entering with this sixteenth part all that is endowed with life, he is next day born in the morning.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib., ch.</i> iii, <i>Brāh.</i> ii. 'There are eight fetters and eight auxiliaries. (The sense-organs and their functions.)</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Svet. Up.</i> i, 4. 'Him we consider as a wheel (<i>see</i> below), with one circumference of sixteen parts.' (The eleven organs and the five gross elements.)</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> v, 14. 'He who is the cause of the origin of the sixteen parts.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Chhandog. Up.</i> vi, vii. 'Man, my child, is sixteen-fold ... of thy sixteen parts only one now remains ... when the last remnant of thy sixteen parts is invigorated by food, thou canst understand the Vedas.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Pra.sna Up.</i> 6.	'Let man know the spirit who ought to be known, in whom the (sixteen) parts abide, as the spokes in the nave (of the wheel).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mahābh. Mokshadh.</i> P., § 184, 35.	'These (attributes) are the sixteen different kinds of form which constitute the property of light or vision.' <i>Ib.,</i> § 199. 'The sixteen attributes' (the five breaths, the ten senses and mind).</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> 232, 12. 'The same total (of those limbs), invested with form and having sixteen constituent parts, becomes what is called body.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> 241, 17. 'He takes rebirth with a body of eleven elements ... with subtle form making a total of sixteen.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> 305, 8. 'That body of sixteen parts called the unmanifest.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> 311.15. 'Those knowing <i>adhyātma</i> regard mind as the sixteenth.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib.,</i> 321, 108.	'The sixteenth principle is <i>avidyā.</i>'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Ib., A.svamedha P.</i> (<i>Anugītā</i> 36, 34). 'By action	a creature is born with a body and made up of the sixteen.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Cf.</i> also <i>Manu</i> ix, 124.	'Fifteen cows and a bull.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It seems then that of these sixteen parts one is chief, the others negligible.</p>
