					<p><i><b>"Our old friend," etc.</b></i> — The Master told this tale while dwelling in Jetavana, concerning a greedy Brother. The occasion is as above.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was a pigeon and lived in a nest-basket in the kitchen of a Benares merchant. A crow became intimate with him and lived there also. Here the story is to be expanded. The cook pulled out the crow's feathers and sprinkled him with flour, then piercing a cowrie he hung it on the crow's neck and threw him into a basket. The Bodhisatta came from the wood, and seeing him made a jest and spoke the first stanza: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Our old friend! look at him!<br />
					      A jewel bright he wears;<br />
					      His beard in gallant trim,<br />
					      How gay our friend appears!</p>

					<p class="f4">[315] The crow hearing him spoke the second stanza: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">My nails and hair had grown so fast,<br />
					      They hampered me in all I did:<br />
					      A barber came along at last,<br />
					      And of superfluous hair I'm rid.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bodhisatta spoke the third stanza: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Granted you got a barber then,<br />
					      Who has cropped your hair so well:<br />
					      Round your neck, will you explain,<br />
					      What's that tinkling like a bell?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the crow uttered two stanzas: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Men of fashion wear a gem<br />
					      Round the neck: it's often done:<br />
					      I am imitating them:<br />
					      Don't suppose it's just for fun.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If you're really envious<br />
					      Of my beard that's trimmed so true:<br />
					      I can get you barbered thus;<br />
					      You may have the jewel too.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bodhisatta hearing him spoke the sixth stanza: —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Nay, 'tis you they best become,<br />
					      Gem and beard that's trimmed so true.<br />
					      I find your presence troublesome:<br />
					      I go with a good-day to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">[316] With these words he flew up and went elsewhere; and the crow died then and there.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>After the lesson, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth: — After the Truths, the greedy Brother was established in the fruition of the Third Path: "At that time the crow was the greedy Brother, the pigeon was myself."</p>
