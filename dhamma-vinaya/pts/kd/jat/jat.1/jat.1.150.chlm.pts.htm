					<p>"<i><b>Befriend a villain</b></i>." — This story was told by the Master when at the Bamboo-grove, about King Ajātasattu's adherence to false teachers.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> For he believed in that rancorous foe of the Buddhas, the base and wicked Devadatta, and in his infatuation, wishing to do honour to Devadatta, expended a vast sum in erecting a monastery at <span class="mozp">Gayāsīsa.</span> And following Devadatta's wicked counsels, he slew <span class="f3 g"><i>[320]</i></span> the good and virtuous old King his father, who had entered on the Paths, thereby destroying his own chance of winning like goodness and virtue, and bringing great woe upon himself.</p>

					<p>Hearing that the earth had swallowed up Devadatta, he feared a like fate for himself. And such was the frenzy of his terror that he reeked not of his kingdom's welfare, slept not upon his bed, but ranged abroad quaking in every limb, like a young elephant in an agony of pain. In fancy he saw the earth yawning for him, and the flames of hell darting forth; he could see himself fastened down on a bed of burning metal with iron lances being thrust into his body. Like a wounded cock, not for one instant was he, at peace. The desire came on him to see the All-Wise Buddha, to be reconciled to him, and to ask guidance of him; but because of the magnitude of his transgressions he shrank from coming into the Buddha's presence. When the <span class="mozp">Kattikā</span> festival came round, and by night <span class="mozp">Rājagaha</span> was illuminated and adorned like a city of the gods, the King, as he sat on high upon a throne of gold, saw <span class="mozp"><span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> Komārabhacca</span> sitting near. The idea flashed across his mind to go with <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> to the Buddha, but he felt he could not say outright that he would not go alone but wanted <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> to take him. No; the better course would be, after praising the beauty of the night, [509] to propose sitting at the feet of some sage or brahmin, and to ask the courtiers what teacher can give the heart peace. Of course, they would severally praise their own masters; but <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> would be sure to extol the All-Enlightened Buddha; and to the Buddha the King with <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> would go. So he burst into fivefold praises of the night, saying--"How fair, sirs, is this clear cloudless night! How beautiful! How charming! How delightful! How lovely!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> What sage or brahmin shall we seek out, to see if haply he may give our hearts peace?"</p>

					<p>Then one minister recommended <span class="mozp">Pūraṇa Kassapa,</span> another Makkhali <span class="mozp">Gosāla</span>, and others again Ajita Kesakambala, Kakudha <span class="mozp">Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, or Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta.</span> All these names the King heard in silence, waiting for his chief minister, <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span>, to speak. But <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span>, suspecting that the King's real object was to make him speak, kept silence in order to make sure. At last the King said, "Well, my good <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span>, why have you nothing to say?" At the word <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> arose from his seat, and with hands clasped in adoration towards the Blessed One, cried, "Sire, yonder in my mango-grove dwells the All-Enlightened Buddha with thirteen hundred and fifty Brethren. This is the high fame that has arisen concerning him." And here he proceeded to recite the nine titles of honour ascribed to him, beginning with 'Venerable.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> When he had further shewn how from his birth onwards the Buddha's powers had surpassed all the earlier presages and expectations, <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> said, "Unto him, the Blessed One, let the King repair, to hear the truth and to put questions."</p>

					<p>His object thus attained, the King asked <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span> to have the elephants got ready and went in royal state to <span class="mozp">Jīvaka</span>'s mango-grove, where he found in the perfumed pavilion the Buddha amid the Brotherhood which was tranquil as the ocean in perfect repose. Look where he would, the King's eye saw only the endless ranks of the Brethren, exceeding in numbers any following he had ever seen. Pleased with the demeanour of the Brethren, the King bowed low and spoke words of praise. Then saluting the Buddha, he seated himself, and asked him the question, 'What is the fruit of the religious life?' And the Blessed One gave utterance to the <span class="mozp">Sāmaññaphala</span> Sutta in two sections.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Glad at heart, the King made his peace with the Buddha at the close of the Sutta, and rising up departed with solemn obeisance. Soon after the King had gone, <span class="f3 g"><i>[321]</i></span> the Master addressed the Brethren and said, "Brethren, this King is uprooted; [510] had not this King slain in lust for dominion that righteous ruler his father, he would have won the Arahat's clear vision of the Truth, ere he rose from his seat. But for his sinful favouring of Devadatta he has missed the fruit of the first path."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Next day the Brethren talked together of all this and said that Ajātasattu's crime of parricide, which was due to that wicked and sinful Devadatta whom he had favoured, had lost him salvation; and that Devadatta had been the King's ruin. At this point the Master entered the Hall of Truth and asked the subject of their converse. Being told, the Master said, "This is not the first time, Brethren, that Ajātasattu has suffered for favouring the sinful; like conduct in the past cost him his life." So saying, he told this story of the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta was born into the family of a wealthy brahmin. Arriving at years of discretion, he went to study at <span class="mozp">Takkasilā</span>, where he received a complete education. In Benares as a teacher he enjoyed world-wide fame and had five hundred young brahmins as pupils. Among these was one named <span class="mozp">Sañjīva,</span> to whom the Bodhisatta taught the spell for raising the dead to life. But though the young man was taught this, he was not taught the counter charm. Proud of his new power, he went with his fellow-pupils to the forest wood-gathering, and there came on a dead tiger.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now see me bring the tiger to life again," said he.</p>

					<p class="f4">"You can't," said they.</p>

					<p class="f4">"You look and you will see me do it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, if you can, do so," said they and climbed up a tree forthwith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <span class="mozp">Sañjīva</span> repeated his charm and struck the dead tiger with a potsherd. Up started the tiger and quick as lightning sprang at <span class="mozp">Sañjīva</span> and bit him on the throat, killing him outright. Dead fell the tiger then and there, and dead fell <span class="mozp">Sañjīva</span> too at the same spot. So there the two lay dead side by side.</p>

					<p class="f4">The young brahmins took their wood and went back to their master to whom they told the story. "My dear pupils," said he, "mark herein how by reason of showing favour to the sinful and paying honour where it was not due, he has brought all this calamity upon himself." And so saying he uttered this stanza: — </p>

					<p class="f4 in2">[511] Befriend a villain, aid him in his need,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, like that tiger which <span class="mozp">Sañjīva</span>&nbsp;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> raised<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To life, he straight devours you for your pains.</p>

					<p><span class="f3 g"><i>[322]</i></span> Such was the Bodhisatta's lesson to the young brahmins, and after a life of almsgiving and other good deeds he passed away to fare according to his deserts.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>His lesson ended the Master identified the Birth by saying, "Ajātasattu was the young brahmin of those days who brought the dead tiger to life, and I the world-famed teacher."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> See <i>Vinaya</i>, <i>Cullav</i>. vii. 3. 4-- (translated in <i>S. B. E.</i> XX. pp. 242 etc). In the <span class="mozp"><i>Sāmaññaphala Sutta</i></span>, the Dīgha Nikāya gives the incidents of this introductory story and makes the King confess to having killed his father (Vol. I. p. 85).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> These exclamations are misprinted as verse in the <span class="mozp">Pāli</span> text. It is curious that the order is somewhat transposed here, as compared with the opening words of the <i>Sāmaññaphala Sutta</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> See p. 49 of Vol. I. of the <span class="mozp">Dīgha Nikāya</span> for the list.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> In the Dīgha Nikāya there is no division of the Sutta into two bhāṇavāras or sections.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Unlike the preceding sentence, this last sentence does not occur in the <span class="mozp">Dīgha Nikāya.</span> The interpolation is interesting as suggesting the license with which words were put into the Master's mouth by Buddhist authors.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The gloss suggests that <i>sañjīviko</i>, (='of or belonging to Sañjīva') is an acrid pun on the meaning of Sañjīvo, which means 'alive,'--the tiger having been restored to life by Sañjīva, whom it bereft of life by way of reward.</p>
