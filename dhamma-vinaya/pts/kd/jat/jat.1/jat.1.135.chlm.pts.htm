					<p>"<i><b>Who sagely meditates</b></i>." — This story too was told by the Master while at Jetavana about the interpretation of a problem by the Elder <span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span> at the gate of <span class="mozp">Saɱkassa</span>.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time when Brahmadatta was reigning in Benares, the Bodhisatta, as he expired in his forest-home, answered his disciples' enquiries with the words — "Moonlight and Sunlight." With these words he died and passed to the Radiant Realm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when the chief disciple interpreted the Master's words his fellows did not believe him. Then back came the Bodhisatta and from mid-air recited this stanza:—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Who sagely meditates on sun and moon,<br />
					      Shall win (when Reason unto Ecstasy<br />
					      Gives place) his after-lot in Radiant Realms.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Such was the Bodhisatta's teaching, and, first praising his disciple, he went his way back to the Brahma Realm.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>His lesson ended, the Master identified the Birth by saying, "<span class="mozp">Sāriputta</span> was the chief disciple of those days, and I <span class="mozp">Mahā-Brahmā</span>."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> These technical lines imply that, by taking the Sun and Moon as his <span class="mozp"><i>kammaṭṭhāna</i></span>, or subject for meditation, a Buddhist, by attaining <span class="mozp">Jhāna</span> (or Insight) in the second (<i>i.e.</i> supra-rational) degree, can save himself from re-birth in a lower sphere of existence than the <span class="mozp">Ābhassaraloka</span> or Radiant Realm of the corporeal Brahma-world.</p>
