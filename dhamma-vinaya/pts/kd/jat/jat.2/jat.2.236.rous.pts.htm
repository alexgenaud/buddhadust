					<p>"<i><b>See that twice-born bird</b></i>," <i>etc</i>. — This story the Master told while staying in Jetavana, about a hypocrite. When he was brought before the Master, the Master said, "Brethren, he was a hypocrite of old just as he is now," and told the following story.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta became a Fish in a certain pond in the Himalaya region, and a great shoal went with him. Now a Crane desired to eat the fish. So in a place near the pond he drooped his head, and spread out his wings, and looked vacantly, vacantly at the fish, waiting till they were off their guard.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> At the same moment the Bodhisatta with his shoal came to that place in search of food. And the shoal of fish on seeing the crane uttered the first stanza:—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"See that twice-born<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> bird, how white —<br />
					      Like a water-lily seeming;<br />
					      Wings outspread to left and right —<br />
					      Oh, how pious! dreaming, dreaming!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bodhisatta looked, and uttered the second stanza:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"What he is ye do not know,<br />
					      Or you would not sing his praises.<br />
					      He is our most treacherous foe;<br />
					      That is why no wing he raises."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the fish splashed in the water and drove the crane away.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>When this discourse was ended, the Master identified the Birth: — "This hypocrite was the Crane, and I was the chief of the shoal of fish."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> A crane's sleep" is an Indian proverb for trickery.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>dijo</i> is used of a bird as born in the egg and from the egg. It is also applied to Brahmins, and so conveys an additional notion of piety.</p>
