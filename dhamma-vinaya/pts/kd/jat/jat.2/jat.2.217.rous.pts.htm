					<p>"<i><b>All the world's on pleasure bent</b></i>," <i>etc</i>. — This story the Master told, while dwelling at Jetavana, about a greengrocer who was a lay-brother.</p>

					<p>The circumstances have been already given in the First Book.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Here again the Master asked him where he had been so long; and he replied, "My daughter, Sir, is always smiling. After testing her, I gave her in marriage to a young gentleman. As this had to be done, I had no opportunity of paying you a visit." To this the Master answered, "Not now only is your daughter virtuous, but virtuous she was in days of yore; and as you have tested her now, so you tested her in those days." And at the man's request he told an old-world tale.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was king of Benares, the Bodhisatta was a tree-spirit.</p>

					<p class="f4">This same pious greengrocer took it into his head to test his daughter. He led her into the woods, [180] and seized her by the hand, making as though he had conceived a passion for her. And as she cried out in woe, he addressed her in the words of the first stanza:—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"All the world's on pleasure bent;<br />
					      Ah, my baby innocent!<br />
					      Now I've caught you, pray don't cry;<br />
					      As the town does, so do I."</p>

					<p class="f4">When she heard it, she answered, "Dear Father, I ant a maid, and I know not the ways of sin:" and weeping she uttered the second stanza:—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"He that should keep me safe from all distress,<br />
					      The same betrays me in my loneliness;<br />
					      My father, who should be my sure defence,<br />
					      Here in the forest offers violence."</p>

					<p class="f4">And the greengrocer, after testing his daughter thus, took her home, and gave her in marriage to a young man. Afterwards he passed away according to his deeds.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>When the Master had ended this discourse, he declared the Truths and identified the Birth: — at the end of the Truths the greengrocer entered on the Fruit of the First Path: — "In those days, father and daughter were the same as now, and the tree-spirit that saw it all was I myself."</p>
