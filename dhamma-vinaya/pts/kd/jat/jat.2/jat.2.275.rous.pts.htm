					<p>[365] "<i><b>Who is this pretty Crane</b></i>," etc. — This story the Master told at Jetavana about some greedy Brother. The two stories are just the same as the last. And these are the verses:—</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Who is this pretty Crane, and why<br />
					      Does he in my Crow's basket lie?<br />
					      An angry bird, my friend the Crow!<br />
					      This is his nest, I'd have you know!"</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Do you not know me, friend, indeed?<br />
					      Together we were used to feed!<br />
					      I would not do as I was told,<br />
					      So now I'm plucked, as you behold."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"You'll come to grief again, I know—<br />
					      It is your nature to do so.<br />
					      When people make a dish of meat<br />
					      'Tis not for little birds to eat."</p>

					<p class="f4">As before, the Bodhisatta said — "I can't live here any more," and flew away some whither.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>When this discourse was ended, the Master declared the Truths and identified the Birth: — at the conclusion of the Truths, the greedy Brother attained the Fruit of the Third Path: — "The greedy Brother was the Crow, and I was the Pigeon."</p>
