       			<h4><a id="preface">Translator's Preface</a></h4>

					<p>This short collection of eighty suttas consists of verses of a more or less cryptic nature, to explain which in their proper context prose stories have been composed, just as is the case with what are called <i>Jātaka</i> Tales,compositions of the 'after-men,' the essential part being the verses ascribed to the Teacher. In the case of the <i>Udāna</i> the verses may well be genuine, but it does not follow that the prose part is right in its application in each case. As to the <i>Jātaka</i> verses, which progress in number like the <i>Aṇguttara</i> or <i>Gradual Sayings,</i> it is doubtful whether they are genuine utterances, with the exception of the very brief ones, while the stories applied to them, with their commentary, are romances, and in some cases folk-lore common to most nations.</p>
					
					<p>Why was the name <i>Udāna</i> given to this collection? As readers of the Upanishads are aware, the word <i>udāna</i> signifies one of the 'vital airs' <i>(prāṇa, apāna, samāna, vyāna, udāna)</i>, which has its plexus in the throat, controls the other four, passes up and out at the crown of the head. This throat-plexus is probably the origin of the 'lump in the throat' felt by some under strong emotion. Thus at <i>Brihad Ārany. Upan.</i> I, v, 3, 'the vital air (<i>udāna</i>) which goes upwards also at IV, ii, 4; at <i>Chand. Up.</i> III, xiii, 5, 'the upper aperture is <i>udāna</i>, which is the wind, which is the sky5; id. V, xxiii,'by the satisfaction of <i>udāna</i> the wind <i>(vayu</i>) is satisfied; also at <i>Praśna Up.</i> III, v, 7. In the (later) <i>Anugīta,</i> ch. V, the control of this centre, which governs the organs of speech, destroys <i>saṃsāra</i> and leads to the Supreme Self.</p>
					
					<p>It refers then to drawing in, controlling and breathing out. The usual interpretation is 'out-breathing,' 'solemn or ecstatic utterance' and the phrase <i>imaṃ</i> <a id="pgvi" href="#pgvi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[vi]</b></span></a> <i>udānam udānesi</i> becomes 'breathed forth this solemn utterance.' In another sense it may be taken as 'inspired words.' Mrs Rhys Davids originally suggested 'cries of the soul,' or 'cries or sighs of heart.' As, however, it is evident that the verses, if not 'inspired,' are 'inspiring,' uttered with a view to human uplift, we have agreed to call <i>Udāna</i> 'verses of uplift.'</p>
					
					<p>The traditional explanation of the commentators may be read in the Commentary of Dhammapālācariya (c. 500 A.D.) on <i>Udāna (Paramaṭṭha-dīpanī</i> or <i>UdA.</i> <i>P.T.S.</i> ed., p. 2): 'In what sense is the word <i>udāna</i> used? It is the expiration of an accumulated thrill-wave of strong emotion <i>(pīṭi).</i> Just as oil and such-like material for measurement, when it cannot occupy the measure <i>(māna)</i> oozes out, and that is called 'the overflow'; and as the water which a reservoir cannot hold runs out, and that is called 'flood-water,' even so that accumulated thrill-wave of strong emotion, of thought directed and diffused <i>(vitakka-vipphāra),</i> which the heart cannot contain, when it grows to excess cannot stay within, but bursts forth by way of the door of speech, regardless of who receives it — in fact an extraordinary expiration <i>(udāhāra-viseso)</i> — that is called <i>udāna</i>. Thus Dhammapāla, slightly adding to what is attributed to Buddhaghosa, who a little earlier had copied the ancient Commentaries. See also <i>DA.</i> i, 140; <i>SA.</i> i, 60, 80; ii, 273; <i>AA.</i> on <i>A.</i> III, 238 (abbreviations explained in the last index to this volume).</p>
					
					<p>The commentator goes on to say that the ecstatic verses of monks and nuns (in <i>Thera-therī-gāthā</i>) are not to be termed <i>udāna</i> but <i>sīha-nādā,</i> lion-roars or bold assertions; that the majority of what are to be termed <i>Buddha-udāna</i> are collected in <i>Dhammapada;</i> that the prose part, introduced in each case by the words 'thus have I heard,' was the work of Ānanda, who recited the verses and supplied the context of each set at the first 'chanting-together' — i.e., at the First Convention after the Teacher's death.</p>
					
					<p>The collection is divided into eight vaggas or chapters of ten suttas each, several of which occur in <i>Vinaya</i> <a id="pgvii" href="#pgvii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[vii]</b></span></a> <i>Pitaka</i> (<i>Mahā-</i> and <i>Culla-vagga</i>) and one in the <i>Mahā-parinibbāna-sutta</i> of <i>Dīgha Nikāya.</i></p>
					
					<p>A glance at the index will show that the scene of the majority of these little stories was laid at Sāvatthī. I therefore judge that it is an independent collection of the reciters of the school of monks there; for which subject my Preface to <i>Kindred Sayings</i>, v (<i>Saṃyutta-Nikāya</i>) may be consulted. It forms one of the Fifth or Short Collection <i>(Khuddaka-Nikāya)</i>, of which the first two works, <i>Dhammapada</i> and <i>Khuddaka-pāṭha</i>, have appeared in the previous volume of this Series, translated by Mrs. Rhys Davids. The other works of this collection are <i>Itivuttaka</i> (of the present volume), <i>Sutta-nipāta,</i> lately translated by Lord Chalmers (Harvard Univ. Series), <i>Vimāna-vatthu</i> (poems on the heaven world), <i>Peta-vatthu</i> (stories of ghosts), <i>Thera-therī-gāthā</i> (Psalms of the Brethren and Sisters, translated by Mrs. Rhys Davids), <i>Jātaka</i> (verses and tales), <i>Niddesa</i> (a commentary on part of <i>Sutta-nipāta</i>), together with works of an evidently later date, which must have been added subsequently-viz., <i>Paṭisambhidā-magga</i> (way of analysis), <i>Apadāna</i> (legendary verses of monks and nuns), <i>Buddhavaṃsa</i> (a history of the Buddhas), and <i>Cariyā-piṭaka</i> (verses on the Buddha-perfections).</p>
					
					<p>In the present volume and the fifth of <i>Gradual Sayings</i> I have used 'Wayfarer' for Tathāgata and adopted Lord Chalmers' word 'cankers' for <i>āsava.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, with the deva-sight, purified and more than that of humans, beheld such rudeness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> as this on the part of the former mate of Sangāmaji, and at that time, seeing the meaning of it, he gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion Bāhiya of the Bark Garment<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> was staying at Suppāraka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span> on the seashore, being esteemed, honoured, thought much of, worshipped and with deference paid to him, and he got plenty of robes and alms-food, bed and seat, comforts and medicines for sickness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now consideration arose in the mind of Bāhiya of the Bark Garment thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'I wonder whether I am one of those who in the world are arahants or have attained the arahant path.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{7}</span> Then a devatā<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> who was formerly a blood-relation of Bāhiya of the Bark Garment, out of compassion and desire for his welfare, knowing with his own mind the consideration of his mind, came to where he was and said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Garment:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Bāhiya, <a id="pg9" href="#pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>{9}</b></span></a> neither are you arahant nor have you reached the arahants'path.</p>

					<p class="f4">'But,' asked Bāhiya, 'who in the world with its devas are arahants or have reached the arahants' path?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There is a town, Bāhiya, in the far-of£ districts named Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There now dwells that Exalted One who is arahant, a rightly awakened One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He indeed, Bāhiya, is arahant and teaches dhamma for reaching arahantship.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Bāhiya of the Bark Garment, stirred by that devatā, left Suppāraka, and, staying only a single night throughout the journey,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> came to where the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion a great number of monks were walking about in the open air.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Bāhiya of the Bark Garment went up to them and said this to those monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Pray, sirs, where now is the Exalted One dwelling, he who is arahant, a rightly awakened One?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> are desirous of seeing that arahant who is a rightly awakened One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him he went up to the Exalted One, fell with his head at his feet and said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, let the Exalted One teach me dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg10" href="#pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>{10}</b></span></a> At these words the Exalted One said this to Bāhiya of the Bark Garment:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time Bāhiya of the Bark Garment said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then yet a third time Bāhiya of the Bark Garment said to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One teach me dhamma!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let the Wellfarer teach me dhamma, such as may be to my profit and happiness for a long time!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Then, Bāhiya, thus must you train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you must train yourself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, Bāhiya, when in the seen there will be to you just the seen, in the heard just the heard, in the imagined just the imagined, in the cognized just the cognized, then, Bāhiya, as you will have no "thereby," you will have no "therein."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As you, Bāhiya, will have no "therein," it follows that you will have no "here" or "beyond" or "midway between."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is just the end of Ill.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg11" href="#pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>{11}</b></span></a> Thereupon Bāhiya of the Bark Garment, thanks to this concise dhamma-teaching of the Exalted One, by not clinging, thenceforth released his mind from the cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him he said to the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Monks, take up the body of Bāhiya of the Bark Garment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bring a litter, carry it away and burn it and pile a cairn thereon.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, monks, a fellow in the Brahma-life has met his end.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Yes, sir,' replied those monks to the Exalted One, and they took up the body, brought a litter, set it thereon and burned it, and when they had piled a cairn they came to the Exalted One, saluted him and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then as they sat at one side those monks said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, the body of Bāhiya of the Bark Garment is burned and a cairn set up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pray what is his bourn, what is his future destiny?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'A sage, monks, was Bāhiya of the Bark Garment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He went in accordance with dhamma, and he vexed me not in the matter of dhamma-teaching.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bāhiya of the Bark Garment, monks, has won utter freedom.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{9}</span> Thereupon the Exalted One, seeing the meaning of it, at that time gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, seeing the meaning of it, at that time gave utterance to this verse of uplift:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Nanda, brother to the Exalted One, the son of the Exalted One's aunt,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn91" href="#n91">91</a>]</sup></span> thus addressed a great number of monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Good sirs, without zest I follow the Brahma-life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I cannot endure the Brahma-life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Giving up the training, I will go back to the low.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg26" href="#pg26"><span class="f2 g"><b>{26}</b></span></a> Then a certain monk went to the Exalted One ... as he sat at one side that monk repeated the words of the venerable Nanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{22}</span> Then the Exalted One called to a certain monk, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come thou, monk!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In my name summon the monk Nanda, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Nanda, good sir, the Teacher summons you."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Yes, sir,'replied that monk to the Exalted One, and went (and gave Nanda the message of the Exalted One).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, good sir,' said the venerable Nanda, and went to the Exalted One. ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he sat at one side the Exalted One said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Is it true, as they say, Nanda, that you addressed a great number of monks, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Good sirs, without zest I follow the Brahma-life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I cannot endure the Brahma-life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Giving up the training, I will go back to the low."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is true, sir.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'But how is it, Nanda, that you have no zest for the Brahma-life, that you cannot endure it, that you will give up the training and return to the low?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, when I left my home, a Sakyan girl, the fairest in the land, with hair half combed, looked back at me and said this, "May you soon be back again, young master."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, as I am always thinking of that, I have no zest for the Brahma-life, I cannot endure the Brahma-life, I will give up the training and return to the low.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, taking the venerable Nanda by the arm, just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend it when stretched out, even so did the Exalted One vanish from Jeta Grove and appear among the devas of the Thirty-Three.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time as many as five hundred nymphs were come to minister to Sakka, lord of the devas, and they were called 'dove-footed.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One said to the venerable Nanda,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Nanda, do you see those five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed"?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Yes, sir.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Now what think you, Nanda?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which are the more lovely, more worth looking at, more charming, the Sakyan girl, the loveliest in the land, or these five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed"?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg27" href="#pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>{27}</b></span></a> '0, sir, just as if she<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn92" href="#n92">92</a>]</sup></span> were a mutilated monkey with ears and nose cut off, even so, sir, the Sakyan girl, the loveliest in the land, if set beside these five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed," is not worth a fraction of them, she cannot be compared with them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{23}</span> Why, these five hundred nymphs are far more lovely, far more worth looking at, far more charming!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One, taking the venerable Nanda by the arm, just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm, or bend it when stretched out, even so did he vanish from the devas of the Thirty-Three and reappear in Jeta Grove.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the monks heard the rumour:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They say that the venerable Nanda, brother of the Exalted One, the son of the Exalted One's aunt, leads the Brahma-life for the sake of nymphs.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They say the Exalted One has assured him of getting five hundred nymphs called 'dovefooted.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereafter the monks who were comrades of the venerable Nanda called him by the name of 'hireling' and 'menial,' saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'A hireling surely is the venerable Nanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A menial surely is the venerable Nanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He leads the Brahma-life for the sake of nymphs.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Tis said the Exalted One is surety to the venerable Nanda for getting five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Nanda being thus worried, humiliated and despised since he was called 'hireling' and 'menial' by his comrades, living alone, remote, energetic, ardent, making the self strong,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn93" href="#n93">93</a>]</sup></span> in no long time attained in this very world, himself realizing it by full comprehension, that for which the clansman rightly goes forth from home to the homeless, even that unsurpassed goal of the Brahma-life, and so abode (realizing):</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ended is birth,<br />
					lived is the life,<br />
					done is what was to be done;<br />
					<a id="pg28" href="#pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>{28}</b></span></a> there is no more of being here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus the venerable Nanda was one of the arahants.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now a certain devatā, as night was waning, lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with surpassing radiance, came to see the Exalted One, and on coming to him saluted him and stood at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So standing that devatā said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, the venerable Nanda, the Exalted One's brother and son of his aunt, by ending of the cankers has in this very world, himself realizing it by full comprehension, won the heart's release, the release by insight, which is canker-free, and so abides.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{24}</span> Then in the Exalted One also arose that knowledge that the venerable Nanda, by ending of the cankers had in this very world, himself realizing it by full comprehension, won the heart's release, the release by insight, which is canker-free, and so abode.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then at the end of that night the venerable Nanda came to the Exalted One and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took a seat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he thus stood he said this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, as to the Exalted One's standing surety for me for the getting five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed," I release the Exalted One, sir, from that promise.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'I also, Nanda, grasping your thought with my own, have seen that standing surety for you for the getting five hundred nymphs called "dove-footed," you have released me from that promise.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, a devatā informed me of the matter, saying,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, the venerable Nanda, the Exalted One's brother and son of his aunt, by ending of the cankers has in this very world, himself realizing it by full comprehension, won the heart's release, the release by insight, which is canker-free, and so abides.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But since, Nanda, by not grasping your heart is released from the cankers, I too am released from my promise.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn94" href="#n94">94</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One, seeing the meaning of it, gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Who hath o'erpassed the slough,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn95" href="#n95">95</a>]</sup></span> crushed down the thorn<br />

					<p class="f4">These new arrivals, greeting the resident monks and arranging about bed and lodging and bestowing their bowls and robes, caused a great noise and hubbub.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, Ānanda, do you go and in my name say to those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, your reverence,' said those monks to the venerable Ānanda, and went to the Exalted One and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they sat thus the Exalted One thus addressed those monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ye deserve not to dwell with me!'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn97" href="#n97">97</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, sir,'replied those monks to the Exalted One, and they rose up, saluted the Exalted One with the right side, put their lodgings in order, took bowl and robe and went away on their alms-round to the Vajjians.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After finishing their alms-round there, they came to the <a id="pg30" href="#pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>{30}</b></span></a> river Vaggumudā.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn98" href="#n98">98</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">There they set up leaf-huts and began to spend the rainy season.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Yasoja, at the beginning of the rainy season, thus addressed those monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Reverend sirs, we have been dismissed by the Exalted One for our own good and profit, out of compassion for us, because he felt compassion for us.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come now, reverend sirs, let us so dwell that the Exalted One may be well pleased with our way of dwelling.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, reverend sir,' replied those monks to his reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly those monks, living remote from men, energetic, ardent, with the self made strong,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn99" href="#n99">99</a>]</sup></span> in that very interval of the rainy season realized all the threefold lore.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn100" href="#n100">100</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, after staying as long as he wished at Sāvatthī, set out on his rounds for Vesālī, and later on in the course of his rounds reached Vesālī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One took up residence at Vesālī in Great Grove at the Hall with Peaked Roof.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One, grasping with his thought the thoughts of those monks living on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, on paying attention to it, called to the venerable Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{26}</span> Ānanda, you might send a message to those <a id="pg31" href="#pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>{31}</b></span></a> monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher is anxious to see your reverences.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, sir,' replied the venerable Ānanda to the Exalted One, and went to a certain monk, and on coming to him said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come thou, good sir!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Go to where are those monks dwelling on the bank of the river Vaggumudā, and on coming to them say,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The Teacher calls for your reverences.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Teacher is anxious to see your reverences."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, sir,' replied that monk to the reverend Ānanda, and just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his arm stretched out, even so did he vanish from the Hall with the Peaked Roof at Great Grove and appear before those monks on the bank of the river Vaggumudā where he said this to those monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Teacher calls for your reverences.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Teacher is anxious to see your reverences.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, good sir,' replied those monks and setting their lodgings in order and taking bowl and robe, just as a strong man might stretch out his bent arm or bend his arm stretched out, even so did they vanish from the bank of the river Vaggumudā and appear at Great Grove in the hall of the peaked roof and face to face with the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then concluding that he was in motionless concentration they also one and all sat down in motionless concentration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the venerable Ānanda, when the night was far spent, the first watch now drawing out, rose from his seat and, throwing his robe over one shoulder,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn103" href="#n103">103</a>]</sup></span> put his hands together and raising them, said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, the night is far spent; the first watch is drawing out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The newly arrived monks have long been seated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, may the Exalted One exchange greetings with the newly arrived monks?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At these words the Exalted One remained silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg32" href="#pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>{32}</b></span></a> Then as the night was far spent and the second watch was drawing out, the venerable Ānanda rose from his seat and <span class="f2">{27}</span> repeated his words, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">The newly arrived monks have long been seated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, may the Exalted One exchange greetings with the newly arrived monks?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And for the second time also the Exalted One remained silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then again, as the night was far spent, and the last watch drawing out, dawn being already at hand and the night wearing a face of gladness,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn104" href="#n104">104</a>]</sup></span> the venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat and, throwing his robe over one shoulder, put his hands together and raising them, said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">The newly arrived monks have long been seated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let the Exalted One exchange greetings with the newly arrived monks?'</p>
							
					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One roused himself from that concentration and said to the venerable Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying near Rājagaha in Bamboo Grove at the Squirrels' Feeding-Ground.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the venerable Kassapa the Great was staying at Figtree Grotto, and for seven days was seated in cross-legged posture, having attained a <a id="pg35" href="#pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>{35}</b></span></a> certain concentration of mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Kassapa the Great, at the end of the seventh day, roused himself from that concentration of mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having done so he thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Suppose I were to enter Rājagaha for alms-food.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion as many as five hundred devatās were busy at work getting alms-food for the venerable Kassapa the Great.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the venerable Kassapa the Great, rejecting those five hundred devatās, robing himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe, entered Rājagaha for alms-food.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sakka, lord of the Devas, was desirous of giving alms-food to the venerable Kassapa the Great.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he took upon him the likeness of a weaver and plied his thread, while Suja,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span> daughter of the Asuras, filled up the shuttle.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Kassapa the Great, as he went on his rounds from house<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span> to house, came to the dwelling of Sakka, lord of the Devas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And Sakka, lord of the Devas, from afar saw the venerable Kassapa the Great as he came.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On seeing him he went out of the house to meet him, took the bowl from his hand, entered the house, took rice from the pot, filled the bowl and gave it back to the venerable Kassapa the Great.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That alms-food was of various broths, various sauces, a mixture of various broths, flavourings and sauces.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{30}</span> Then this thought occurred to the venerable Kassapa the Great:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'I wonder who this being is,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span> that has such magic power?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It must be Sakka, lord of the Devas.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Being sure of it he said to Sakka, lord of the Devas:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is your deed, Kosiya!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do not so again!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg36" href="#pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>{36}</b></span></a> 'But, Kassapa, sir, we too have need of merit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We too have use<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span> for merit!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sakka, lord of the Devas, did reverence to the venerable Kassapa the Great, saluting him with his right side, and mounting into the air thrice uttered this verse of uplift in the sky:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Ah! best of gifts!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On Kassapa the gift is well conferred!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, with deva-hearing, purified and passing that of men, heard Sakka, lord of the Devas, thrice uttering this verse of uplift in the sky.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And at that time, seeing the meaning of it, he gave utterance to this verse of uplift:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">The monk who quests for alms, supporting self,<br />

					<p class="f4">At the sight of it he thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Exalted One gives me leave, I would go to that mango-grove to strive for concentration.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So at eventide he arose from his solitude and went to the Exalted One, and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took a seat to one side, and as he sat thus he told the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, Meghiya, who is conscious of impermanence the consciousness of what is not the self is established.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He who is conscious of what is not the self wins the uprooting of the pride of egoism in this very life, namely, he wins Nibbāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the venerable Sāriputta and Moggallāna the Great were staying at Pigeons' Grotto, and the venerable Sāriputta on a moonlight night, having just had his head shaved, was sitting in the open air, and had won access to a certain stage of concentration.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn167" href="#n167">167</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{40}</span> So also a third time.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then that yakkha, disregarding the other's advice, gave the venerable Sāriputta a blow on the head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Moggallāna the Great with clairvoyant sight, purified and more than human, beheld the blow on the head of the venerable Sāriputta given by that yakkha.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the sight he approached the venerable Sāriputta, and on coming to him asked,</p>

					<p class="f4">It is indeed a wonder, — the great power and majesty of the venerable Sāriputta!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, Sāriputta, my good sir, just now a certain yakkha gave you a blow on the head; so mighty was the blow that one might have felled an elephant seven to eight cubits high or cleft a mountain peak therewith.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And yet the venerable Sāriputta says,</p>

					<p class="f4">I have support, but I do feel a trifling pain in my head.'"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'But it is wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita Park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Exalted One was worried by monks and nuns, lay-followers, both men and women, by rājahs and royal ministers, by sectarians and their followers, and lived in discomfort, not at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe, entered Kosambī to quest for alms-food; and having done his rounds for alms-food in Kosambī, after returning and eating his meal, he himself set his bed and lodging in order, and taking bowl and robe, without informing his attendant or giving notice to the order of monks, alone and unattended, started on his rounds for Pārileyya village, and later on, while on his rounds, reached that place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There the Exalted One took up his dwelling in Guarded Forest Glade, at the foot of a lovely<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn176" href="#n176">176</a>]</sup></span> sal tree.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now a certain bull-elephant was living worried by elephants and she-elephants, by calf-elephants<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn177" href="#n177">177</a>]</sup></span> and sucklings, and had to feed on grass already cropped by them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They ate the bundles of branches as he broke them off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He had to drink muddied water, and when he crossed over by the ford the she-elephants went pushing against his body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he lived in discomfort, not at ease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So this bull-elephant thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Here am I living worried by elephants and she-elephants, by calf-elephants <a id="pg50" href="#pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>{50}</b></span></a> and sucklings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the Exalted One lived in seclusion and solitude, and there arose in him this thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Formerly I dwelt worried by monks and nuns, lay-followers, both men and women, by rājahs and royal ministers, by sectarians and their followers, and lived in discomfort, not at ease.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">But now here am I dwelling unworried by monks and nuns, lay-followers, both men and women, by rājahs and royal ministers, by sectarians and their followers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Unworried, I dwell in comfort and at ease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Likewise that bull-elephant thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I dwell unworried, in comfort and at ease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One, observing his own seclusion and knowing with his mind the thought of that bull-elephant, at that time gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Wanderers holding other views were not esteemed or honoured, thought much of, worshipped; they had no deference paid to them, and got not supplies of robes and alms-food, bed and lodging, comforts and medicines for sickness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn187" href="#n187">187</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then those Wanderers holding other views, unable to bear the honour done to the Exalted One and the order of monks, went to Sundarī the Woman-wanderer, and said this to her:</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{44}</span> 'Sister, you can do a good turn to your kinsmen.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn188" href="#n188">188</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What can I do, brothers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is it possible for me to do?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My very life is a sacrifice<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn189" href="#n189">189</a>]</sup></span> for the sake of my kinsmen.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Then, sister, go you oft and oft to Jeta Grove.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, brothers,' replied Sundarī to those wanderers of other views, and went oft and oft to Jeta Grove.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now when those Wanderers of other views were assured that it was rumoured abroad thus,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sundarī the Woman-wanderer has been clearly seen<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn190" href="#n190">190</a>]</sup></span> by many folk going oft and oft to Jeta Grove,'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">they killed her, and there and then buried her in a hole in a ditch, and went to Pasenadi the Kosalan rājah and said,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Maharājah, that Sundarī the Woman-wanderer is nowhere to be seen.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Well, where do you suspect that she is?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'In Jeta Grove, mahārājah.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Then scour Jeta Grove for her.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So those Wanderers of other views, after scouring Jeta Grove, pulled her body out of the ditch where it had been buried, put it on a litter, and had it taken into Sāvatthī and paraded about from cart-road to cart-road, from <a id="pg53" href="#pg53"><span class="f2 g"><b>{53}</b></span></a> crossways to crossways; and when they met folk they roused their indignation by saying,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Behold, brothers, the deed of the Sakya sons!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Shameless are these recluses!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Sakya sons are wicked, evildoers, liars, no livers of the Brahma-life!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They will claim to be<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn191" href="#n191">191</a>]</sup></span> livers of dhamma, livers at peace, Brahma-livers, truth-tellers, virtuous, men of the lovely life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But there is in them no recluseship, no Brahmahood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their recluse-ship is spotted, their Brahmahood is spotted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could they have recluseship?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could they have Brahmahood?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They have abandoned their recluseship, they have abandoned their Brahmahood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pray, how could a man, after playing a man's part,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn192" href="#n192">192</a>]</sup></span> take the life of a woman?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that time also in Sāvatthī, when folk saw the monks, they assailed, abused, annoyed, and harassed them with vile and bitter words, saying,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Shameless are these recluses!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Sakya sons are wicked, evildoers, liars, no livers of the Brahma-life!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They will claim to be livers of dhamma, livers at peace, Brahma-livers, truth-tellers, virtuous, men of the lovely life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But there is in them no recluseship, no Brahmahood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their recluse-ship is spotted, their Brahmahood is spotted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could they have recluseship?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could they have Brahmahood?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They have abandoned their recluseship, they have abandoned their Brahmahood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pray, how could a man, after playing a man's part, take the life of a woman?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">Now a great number of monks, robing themselves in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī in quest of alms-food, and <span class="f2">{45}</span> having ranged Sāvatthī, after returning from their alms-round and eaten their meal, came to the Exalted One and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they thus sat they said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'In Sāvatthī now, sir, when folk see the monks, they assail them with vile and bitter words, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">How could they have recluseship?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could they have Brahmahood?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They have abandoned their recluseship, they have abandoned their Brahmahood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pray, how could a man, after playing a man's part, take the life of a woman?</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">'This noise, monks, will not last for long.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It will last for just seven days.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the end of seven days it will vanish away.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn193" href="#n193">193</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, monks, do ye with this verse reprimand those folk who, on seeing the monks, assail them with vile and bitter words:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Who speaks untruth to purgatory goes;<br />
							He too who, doing, says: 'I do it not';<br />
							Both these, in passing on, equal become,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg54" href="#pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>{54}</b></span></a> So those monks got this verse by heart in the presence of the Exalted One, and when folk, on seeing the monks, assailed them with vile and bitter words, they reprimanded them with this verse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then people thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'These recluses, the Sakya sons, are not guilty.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn195" href="#n195">195</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">These recluses, the Sakya sons, are on oath.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn196" href="#n196">196</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">And sure enough that noise lasted no long time.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It lasted just seven days.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the end of seven days it vanished away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a number of monks went to the Exalted One and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took seats to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they thus sat they said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is a wonder, sir!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is marvellous, sir, how truly spoken were the Exalted One's words, to wit:</p>

					<p class="f4">It will last for just seven days.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the end of seven days it will vanish away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sir, that noise has vanished away.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One at that time, seeing the meaning of it, gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This one here is of growth to understand dhamma.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So for the sake of Suppabuddha, the leper, he gave a talk dealing in due order<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn213" href="#n213">213</a>]</sup></span> with these topics: on almsgiving, virtue, the heaven world, of the danger, meanness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn214" href="#n214">214</a>]</sup></span> and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of getting free of them.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn215" href="#n215">215</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And Suppabuddha, the leper, saw dhamma, reached dhamma, understood dhamma, plunged into dhamma, crossed beyond doubting, was free from all questionings, won confidence, and needing none other<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn219" href="#n219">219</a>]</sup></span> in the Master's message, rose from his seat, advanced to the Exalted One and on reaching him saluted the Exalted One and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he sat thus, Suppabuddha, the leper, exclaimed to the Exalted One,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Excellent, sir!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as if, sir, one should lift up the fallen, discover the hidden, point out the way to one bewildered, show a light in the gloom, saying, "Now they that have eyes to see can see shapes," — even so in divers ways has the Exalted One expounded dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I, even I, sir, do go for refuge to the Exalted One, to dhamma and the order of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the Exalted One accept me as a follower, as one who from this time forth even to life's end takes refuge in him.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon Suppabuddha, the leper, after being taught, established, roused and made happy by the Exalted One's talk according to dhamma, delighted with what was said, returned thanks, rose from his seat, saluted the Exalted One with his right side and went away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now a young calf rushed upon Suppabuddha,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn220" href="#n220">220</a>]</sup></span> the leper, and caused his death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppabuddha, the leper, monks, by breaking three fetters is a stream-winner, one not doomed to the downfall; he is assured, he is bound for enlightenment.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At these words a certain monk said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Pray, sir, what is the reason, what is the cause why Suppabuddha, the leper, was a poor, mean, miserable creature?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Once upon a time, monk, Suppabuddha, the leper, was a rich man's son in this same Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) Just as, monks, the mighty ocean flows down, slides and tends downward gradually, and there is no abrupt precipice, so also in this dhamma-discipline the training is gradual, the action<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn243" href="#n243">243</a>]</sup></span> is gradual, the procedure<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn244" href="#n244">244</a>]</sup></span> is gradual; there is no abrupt penetration of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{55}</span> (ii) Just as, monks, the mighty ocean is of a stable nature, since it overpasses not its boundary, even so, monks, my disciples transgress not, even at cost of life,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn245" href="#n245">245</a>]</sup></span> the training enjoined on them by me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the second strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as, monks, the mighty ocean consorts not with a dead body; for when a dead body is found in the mighty ocean it quickly wafts it ashore, throws it up on the shorer; even so, monks, whatsoever person is immoral, of a wicked nature, impure, of suspicious behaviour, of covert deeds, one who is no recluse though claiming to be such, one who is no liver of the Brahma-life though claiming to be such, one rotten within, full of lusts, a rubbish — heap of filth, — with such the order consorts not, but gathering together quickly throws him out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Though, monks, he be seated in the midst of the order, yet is he far away from the order; far away is the order from him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the third strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iv) Just as, monks, whatsoever great rivers there are — namely, Gangā, Yamunā, Aciravatī, Sarabhū, Mahi — these, on reaching the mighty ocean, abandon their former names and lineage, and henceforth go by the name of just "mighty ocean," even so, monks, the four castes-namely, the nobles, the brāhmins, the merchants and the serfs — on going forth from home to the homeless in the dhamma-discipline proclaimed by the Wayfarer, abandon their former names and lineage and go by the name of just "recluses who are Sakya sons."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the fourth strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) Just as, monks, whatsoever streams flow into the mighty ocean and whatsoever floods fall from the sky, there is no shrinkage nor overflow seen thereby in the mighty ocean, — even so, monks, though many monks

					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the fifth strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{56}</span> (vi) Just as, monks, the mighty ocean is of one flavour, the flavour of salt, even so, monks, this dhamma is of one flavour, the flavour of release.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the sixth strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vii) Just as, monks, the mighty ocean has many gems, divers gems; therein are the pearl, crystal, lapis lazuli, chank, quartz, coral, silver, pure gold, ruby, catseye; even so in this dhamma are many gems, divers gems; therein are the four arisings of mindfulness, the four best efforts, the four bases of psychic power, the five faculties, the five powers, the seven limbs of wisdom, the Ariyan eightfold way.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn246" href="#n246">246</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Since this is so, monks, this is the sevnth strange and wonderful thing, seeing which again and again monks take delight in this dhamma-discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">(viii) Just as, monks, the mighty ocean is the abode of great creatures, therein are these creatures, — the leviathan, the fish-eater, the monster, Asuras, Nāgas and Gandharvas; even so monks, this dhamma-discipline is the abode of great creatures, therein are these creatures: the stream-winner, he who fares on<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn247" href="#n247">247</a>]</sup></span> by realizing the fruits of stream-winning; the once-returner, he who fares on by realizing the fruits of once-returning; the no-retumer, he who fares on by realizing the fruits of no-return; the arahant, he who fares on by arahantship.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn248" href="#n248">248</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat he said to him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'After keeping the rain-season alone and in seclusion, this chance thought arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">Go thou, Soṇa!<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn257" href="#n257">257</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thou shalt behold that Exalted One, who is delightful and causes delight, calm in faculties and calm of mind; who has attained the uttermost peace and self-control; that naga who is tamed, guarded and controlled in sense.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On seeing him do thou in my name worship with thy head the feet of the Exalted One, and enquire of his health and weal, lightsomeness, vigour and pleasant living.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And say, "Sir, my private teacher, the venerable Kaccāna the Great, worships with his head the Exalted One's feet and enquires of his health and weal, lightsomeness, vigour and pleasant living."'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn258" href="#n258">258</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Very well, sir,' replied the venerable Soṇa, rejoicing at the words of the venerable Kaccāna the Great, and returning thanks, rose from his seat, saluted with his right side, set his bed and lodging in order, took bowl and robe and started off on his rounds for Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After going his rounds in due order he reached Jeta Grove and Anāthapiṇḍika's Park at Sāvatthī.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">

					<p class="f4">Then he came to where the Exalted One was and on reaching him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies, took a seat at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he thus sat he said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Sir, my private teacher, the venerable Kaccāna the Great, worships with his head the Exalted One's feet and enquires of his health and weal, lightsomeness, vigour and pleasant living."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One asked:</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{59}</span> 'Are you bearing up, monk?</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not worn with alms-questing.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One called to the venerable Ānanda, saying, 'Ānanda, get ready bed and lodging for this monk just arrived!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Ānanda thought:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As to the order of the Exalted One that I should get ready bed and lodging for this monk just arrived, the Exalted One wishes to lodge along with the venerable Soṇa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he got ready bed and lodging for the venerable Soṇa in the same dwelling-place with the Exalted One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now the Exalted One, after spending a great part of the night seated in the open air, had his feet washed and entered the residence; so likewise did the venerable Soṇa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then in the night, rising up towards early dawn, the Exalted One said this to the venerable Soṇa:</p>

					<p class="f4">When the venerable Soṇa had finished his recital, the Exalted One thanked him, saying,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Well done, monk!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well done, monk!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well got by heart, well considered and reflected on, monk, are these sixteen sections of the Eights.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You are blest with charming speech, distinctly and clearly enunciated, so as to make your meaning clear.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn261" href="#n261">261</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it that you delayed so long (in wandering forth)?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'For long, sir, I had seen the danger in the passions, <a id="pg72" href="#pg72"><span class="f2 g"><b>{72}</b></span></a> but the household life with its many claims and things to do kept me back.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, seeing the meaning of it, at that time gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>

					<p class="f4">On a certain occasion the Exalted One was going his rounds among the Mallas together with a great company of monks, and came to Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he thus sat the Exalted One taught, established, roused and made happy Cunda the smith with a discourse according to dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Cunda the smith, being thus taught, established, roused and made happy, said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Cunda the smith, when that night had passed, got ready in his own house choice food, both hard and soft, together with a generous dish of truffles,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn362" href="#n362">362</a>]</sup></span> and <a id="pg100" href="#pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>{100}</b></span></a> announced the time for the meal, saying to the Exalted One,</p>

					<p class="f4">I am weary.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will sit down.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Yes, sir,' said the venerable Ānanda, and in obedience to the Exalted One made ready the robe folded in four.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One sat down on the seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the Exalted One can drink and cool his limbs.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a second time the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">I am thirsty, Ānanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I would drink.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Ānanda said this to the Exalted One:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the Exalted One can drink and cool his limbs.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And yet a third time the Exalted One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Ānanda, saying, 'Very well, sir,' in obedience to the Exalted One, took the bowl and went towards that rivulet.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now that rivulet, stirred by the wheels and being shallow, was flowing foul and muddied.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But, as soon as the venerable Ānanda approached, it flowed bright and pure, fresh and unmuddied."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn371" href="#n371">371</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Why, this rivulet which, stirred by the cart-wheels, being shallow, was flowing foul and muddied, on my approach flowed bright and pure, fresh and unmuddied!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So taking water in the bowl he went to the Exalted One, and on coming to him said this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, it is a wonder!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is a miracle wrought by the mighty power and majesty of the Wayfarer!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Ānanda, pray who is building a town at Pāṭaligāma?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Sir, it is Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, who are building a town at Pāṭaligāma for keeping off the Vajjians.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It would seem, Ānanda, that they are doing so after taking counsel with the devas of the Thirty-three.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have just seen, Ānanda, with deva-sight purified and more than human, a great number of devatās in companies

					

					<a id="pg108" href="#pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>{108}</b></span></a> of a thousand occupying sites at Pāṭaligāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">In whatsoever place devatās of less power occupy sites, they bend the thoughts of lesser rulers and officials to build dwelling-places.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ānanda, as far as the sphere of Ariyans extends, as far as merchants travel, this shall become the chief of towns, the place where men shall open up their bales of merchandise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But, Ānanda, three misfortunes shall befall Pāṭaligāma — namely, by fire, by water or by breaking of alliances.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn385" href="#n385">385</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, came to visit the Exalted One, and on coming to him greeted him courteously, and after the exchange of greetings and courtesies stood at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they thus stood <span class="f2">{89}</span> Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, said this to the Exalted One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Let the worshipful Gotama accept our invitation to this day's meal along with the order of monks.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One accepted by silence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, seeing the consent of the Exalted One, returned to their own house, and on getting there made ready in their own house choice food, both hard and soft, and then announced the time to the Exalted One saying,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is time, Master Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The meal is cooked.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One, robing himself in the forenoon and taking bowl and robe, started to go to the house of Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, and on getting there sat down on a seat made ready.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sunīdha and Vassakāra served and satisfied the order of monks, headed by the Buddha, with choice food, both hard and soft.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, seeing that the Exalted One had eaten his fill and had rinsed hand and <a id="pg109" href="#pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>{109}</b></span></a> bowl,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn386" href="#n386">386</a>]</sup></span> took a low seat and sat down at one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they sat thus the Exalted One returned thanks to them in these verses:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">In whatsoever place the prudent man shall make his home,<br />
							Here let him feed good men controlled who live the Brahma-life.<br />
							To all the devas dwelling there<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn387" href="#n387">387</a>]</sup></span> let him make offerings.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn388" href="#n388">388</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Thus honoured, they will honour him: revered, they'll him revere.<br />
							As a mother doth compassionate the child that she hath borne,<br />
							He whom devas compassionate doth ever see good luck.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the Exalted One, after returning thanks with these verses to Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, rose from his seat and went away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time Sunīdha and Vassakāra, great officials of Magadha, were following behind in the footsteps of the Exalted One with this idea:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By whatsoever gate Gotama the recluse shall depart, that gate shall become Gotama Gate.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By whatsoever landing-stage he shall cross the river Ganges, that shall become Gotama Landing-stage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly the gate by which the Exalted One departed was so called.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><span class="f2">{90}</span> Then the Exalted One reached the river Ganges.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time the river Ganges was brimful, level with the banks, so that a crow might drink therefrom.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And some men were hunting for a boat, others for a raft of logs, while some were binding together a bundle of reeds, desirous of crossing to the further shore.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn389" href="#n389">389</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the Exalted One, just as a strong man might <a id="pg110" href="#pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>{110}</b></span></a> straighten out his bent arm or bend his arm outstretched, — even so did he vanish from the hither shore of the river Granges and land upon the further shore together with the company of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One saw those men, some hunting for a boat, others for a raft of logs, others binding together a bundle of reeds, desirous of crossing to the further shore.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One at that time, seeing the meaning of it, gave utterance to this verse of uplift:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">To cross the pool, the flood, to span the swamps they make a bridge.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn390" href="#n390">390</a>]</sup></span><br />

Each action means a different sum, and when the transaction is over no one else is any the wiser as to the value of that gem. The merchant can then turn to another customer and possibly sell it for twice or thrice the amount he paid the dealer for it.' <i>Cf.,</i> also note p. 289 of <i>Nānatiloka's German trans.</i> of <i>Mil.
