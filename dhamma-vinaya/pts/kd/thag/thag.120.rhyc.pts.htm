					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Avanti at Veḷugama,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> as the son of a caravan guide, he became (by correspondence) the unseen friend of Citta, a house-father at Macchikasaṇḍa. The latter wrote to him on the excellence of the Buddha, and sent him a copy of the system. This so moved him that he sought ordination under the Thera Kaccāna the Great. In due course he acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i> Thereupon he had a mind to visit the Buddha, and taking leave of the Thera, came in course of time to the Middle Country,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and had an interview with the Master. The latter asked him the question, 'How goes <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> it with you, bhikkhu? Are you prospering?' And he replied: 'Exalted One, from the time when I was admitted into your Rule, all sorrow and pain left me, all sense of peril was calmed.' And he declared <i>aññā</i> in making that confession, uttering this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v120"><span class="f2 c"><b>[120]</b></span></a> The factors of my life well understood<br />
							Stand yet a little while with severed root.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Sorrow is slain! that quest I've won, and won<br />
							Is purity from fourfold Venom's stain.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Avanti lay north of the Vindhya Mountains, north-east of Bombay. It was one of the four chief monarchies in India when Buddhism arose, and was later absorbed into the Moriyan Empire. Its capital was Ujjenī. Veḷugāma (Bamboo-village) is not, so far, met with in other works (see <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.001.kings.htm">Buddhist India, p. 1</a> ff.). Citta, whose home lay near Sāvatthī, was one of the most eminent lay-supporters of the Buddha. On this further instance, in the later tradition, of the doctrine being propagated by writing, cf. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p97">XCVII.</a> On Kaccāma, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p129">CXXIX.</a> Pronounced Chitta, Kacchāna.</p>
