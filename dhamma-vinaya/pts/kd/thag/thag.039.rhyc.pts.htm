					<p>He was born in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, as the son of the Exalted One's aunt, and named Tissa.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> He left the world to follow the Exalted One, and dwelling in a woodland settlement, was proud because of his rank, being <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> irritable and captious in his conduct, so that he did not do his duties with zeal. Then the Master, surveying him one day with celestial vision from afar, while he was sleeping with open mouth at siesta, came over him above, shedding glory down upon him, and wakening him with these words:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v39"><span class="f2 c"><b>[39]</b></span></a> As one downsmitten by impending sword,<br />
							As one whose hair and turban are aflame,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							So let the Brother, mindful and alert,<br />
							Go forth, all worldly passions left behind.</p>

					<p>When the Thera heard this, his heart was filled with anguish, and he abode intent on insight. Noting this, the Master taught him the 'Sutta of Thera Tissa,' which is in the Saɱyutta collection.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> At the close of it Tissa was established in arahantship. And to confess <i>aññā</i> and honour the Master, he uttered that same verse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> On this metaphor, see <i>Sisters,</i> p. 172, verse 7. The Commentary has a note on various sword-wounds, but the moral is simply the need of instant action, whether to heal or to extinguish. See verse 1, 162 <i>f.</i></p>

They bring him to the Master. The Homily, with catechism, is in keeping with the above. In the <i>Dhammapada</i> <i>Comy,</i> (i. 37) he is called Thulla-Tissa (Fat Tissa). <i>Cf.</i> <i>Saŋy.,</i> i. 13.</p>
