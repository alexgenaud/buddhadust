					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāketa as the son of a brahmin named Madhu-Vaseṭṭha, he was given the name of Mahā-nāga.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> He saw the wonder wrought by Thera Gavampati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> while the Exalted One was staying in the Añjana Wood, and receiving faith, he entered the Order under the Thera, winning arahantship through his counsels.</p>

					<p>Now while he abode in the bliss of emancipation, the Thera Mahā-nāga saw how the six bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> habitually failed to show respect to their co-religionists, and he admonished them in verses which became his confession of <i>aññā</i>:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v387"><span class="f2 c"><b>[387]</b></span></a> Who towards his fellows in the Rule<br />
							Showeth no reverence nor respect,<br />
							From the true Norm he wilts away,<br />
							Like fish where water runneth low.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v388"><span class="f2 c"><b>[388]</b></span></a> Who towards his fellows in the Rule<br />
							Showeth no reverence nor respect,<br />
							In the true Norm he doth not thrive,<br />
							Like rotten seed in furrow sown.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v389"><span class="f2 c"><b>[389]</b></span></a> Who towards, etc.<br />
							Far from Nibbāna standeth he<br />
							Within the Norm-Lord's cult and school.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v390"><span class="f2 c"><b>[390]</b></span></a> Who towards his fellows in the Rule<br />
							Showeth due reverence and respect,<br />
							From the true Norm falls not away,<br />
							Like fish where many waters be.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Nothing else is known of this Brother. His namesake 'of the Black Creeper Pavilion' is a muoh later personage (<i>Jāt.,</i> iv. 490; vi. 30 [text]; <i>JRAS</i>, 1901, p. 893). The name = great wondrous-being or spirit, applied equally to a serpent, an elephant, a thera, and to a class of fairies.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p38">XXXVIII.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> A notorious group of intriguers, whose doings severely tested the organization of the Saŋgha. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p5">Ps. V.;</a> <i>Vinaya Texts,</i> i. 218 n.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Who towards ... showeth (not) is, literally rendered: For whom with respect to his co-religionists reverence does (not) exist, or is not found, or seen (<i>cf.</i> <i>Kathāvatthu Commentary</i> on <i>n'upalabbhati,</i> p. 8; <i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 166, 'is [not] found'). The occasion of these verses as described by Dhammapāla above, let alone the religious consequences invoked, justify my differing hare from Dr. Neumann's rendering. For the similes, <i>cf.</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p207">CCVII.</a> Cult and school = <i>sāsana.</i></p>
