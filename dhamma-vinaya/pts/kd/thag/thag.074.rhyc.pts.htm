					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sālī, as the son of a certain brahmin, he grew up expert in the Three Vedas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Feeling repelled by domestic life, and inclined to jhāna, he met the Exalted One at Sālī, believed, was ordained, and attained arahantship as soon as his head was shaved.</p>

					<p>Thereupon he signalized his putting away the hindrances, and confessed aññā in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v74"><span class="f2 c"><b>[74]</b></span></a> With sensuous desires, with enmity,<br />
							With sloth of mind and torpor of the flesh<br />
							A brother hath no truck, and in his heart<br />
							Turmoil of any kind and doubt are dead.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> It is noteworthy that whereas there were in Dhammapāla's day Four Vedas (including the later Atharva-veda), the Buddhist schools of Eastern India - <i>e.g.,</i> Conjevaram - either did not know of this increment in brahmin literature, or observed sufficient historical accuracy to associate these original Theras with three Vedas only (see <i>Dialogues,</i> i. 109, n. 2). Sāla, or Sālaɱ, a brahmin village in Kosala, is twice mentioned as visited by the Buddha in the <i>Majjhima</i> (Suttas 41, 62; <i>cf.</i> <i>Saɱy.,</i> v. 144); but Sālī has, so far, not been met with elsewhere.</p>
