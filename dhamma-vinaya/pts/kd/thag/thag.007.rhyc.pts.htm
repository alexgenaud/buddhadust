					<p>He, with his elder brother Tapussa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was born in the time of our Exalted One, in the city of Pokkharavatī, as the son of a caravan-driver. As they were conducting a caravan of carts in a pleasant glade, a muddy place checked their progress. Then a tree-fairy, one of their own kin, showed himself, and said: 'Sirs, the Exalted One hath just attained enlightenment, and for seven weeks abideth fasting in the bliss of emancipation, seated at the root of the King's <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> Stead tree.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Serve him with food; this will long make for your good and happiness.' They, with joyful eagerness, waited not to prepare food, but took rice-cakes and honey, and, leaving the high road, ministered to the Exalted One.</p>

					<p>Now when the Exalted One had set rolling the wheel of the Norm at Benares,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> he stayed in due course at Rājagaha. There Tapussa and Bhalliya waited on him and heard him teach. The former became a lay-follower, the latter left the world and mastered the six forms of abhiññā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>One day when Mara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> appeared to the Brother in fearsome terrifying shape, Bhalliya, manifesting how he had passed beyond all fear, uttered a psalm to Mara's discomfiture:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v7"><span class="f2 c"><b>[7]</b></span></a> Whoso hath chased away the Death-king and his host,<br />
							E'en as a mighty flood the causeway of frail reeds,<br />
							Victor is he, self-tamed. Fear cometh never more.<br />
							His is the Goal supreme, and utter steadfastness.</p>

					<p>Thus verily did the venerable Bhalliya utter his psalm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In the Commentarial tradition, they were brothers in like circumstances, when Kassapa Buddha lived, and rendered like service then to Kassapa, entreating that they might repeat it in a future life.</p>
