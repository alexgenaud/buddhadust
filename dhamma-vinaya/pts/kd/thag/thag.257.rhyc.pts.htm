					<p>His story has been recorded above<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Now those verses he spoke in the Master's lifetime, himself not yet arahant, touching the governance of the six powers (five senses and mind). But these verses he uttered after the Master had passed away, and when his own passing away was at hand. And in them he declared the future of bhikkhus under a perverted Norm.</p>

					<p>Now the first stanza was placed by the Compilers.</p>

								<p class="f4 in4"><a id="v920"><span class="f2 c"><b>[920]</b></span></a> These be the thoughts that came to a Brother,<br />
								Seated beneath the great forest's<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> fair blossoms,<br />
								Lone and aloof, in deep contemplation: -</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v921"><span class="f2 c"><b>[921]</b></span></a> How is the conduct of the Brethren changed<br />
							Since when the Sovereign of the world, the Man<br />
							Supreme, was yet abiding on the earth!</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v922"><span class="f2 c"><b>[922]</b></span></a> Raiment to shield from chilly winds, to hide<br />
							What should be hid, enough, no more, they sought,<br />
							Enjoyed contentedly whatever came.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v923"><span class="f2 c"><b>[923]</b></span></a> Whether the food was excellent or poor,<br />
							Whether 'twas much or little, they partook<br />
							To keep life going, free from greedy whims.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v924"><span class="f2 c"><b>[924]</b></span></a> <a id="pg332"><span class="f2 g"><b>[332]</b></span></a> The requisites for men as living things,<br />
							And medicine too as means to live: - for these<br />
							Not fervently they cared, as care they did<br />
							How to destroy the poisons of the mind.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v925"><span class="f2 c"><b>[925]</b></span></a> In the deep forests 'neath the shade of trees,<br />
							In caverns, in the bosom of the rocks,<br />
							Detachment studying and developing: -<br />
							So lived they making that their instant quest.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v926"><span class="f2 c"><b>[926]</b></span></a> Of lowly, humble soul and frugal ways,<br />
							Gentle of heart, pliant and apt in mind,<br />
							Of gracious manner, speech not scurrilous,<br />
							Intent on good [for others and for self].<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v927"><span class="f2 c"><b>[927]</b></span></a> Pleasant and lovely therefore in their lives: -<br />
							Their goings, their enjoyments, their pursuits, -<br />
							Like the smooth tenour of a stream of oil.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v928"><span class="f2 c"><b>[928]</b></span></a> For them every intoxicant was dead,<br />
							Mighty in Jhāna they, mighty for good:<br />
							Now are those Elders wholly passed away.<br />
							Few now-a-days there be like unto them.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v929"><span class="f2 c"><b>[929]</b></span></a> From dearth of good conditions and insight,<br />
							The Conqueror's Rule, compact of all that's best<br />
							In plan and mode, crumbles and wears away.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v930"><span class="f2 c"><b>[930]</b></span></a> Bad the conditions and corrupt the age,<br />
							Wherein e'en they, who for the life detached<br />
							Had made good start, and to the higher things<br />
							That yet remain [might follow on], - e'en they</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v931"><span class="f2 c"><b>[931]</b></span></a> From the swift growth of all that doth corrupt,<br />
							Do influence for evil many folk.<br />
							Methinks they juggle with [the consciences<br />
							Of] fools as devils sport with the insane.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v932"><span class="f2 c"><b>[932]</b></span></a> By the corruptions overcome, such men, -<br />
							Pursuing here and there what doth corrupt,<br />
							As one who calleth loud what he hath got, -<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v933"><span class="f2 c"><b>[933]</b></span></a> <a id="pg333"><span class="f2 g"><b>[333]</b></span></a> They quarrel 'mongst themselves, forsaking quite<br />
							The blessed Norm, and, after errors gone,<br />
							Do ween: - Lo! this is better, this is best.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v934"><span class="f2 c"><b>[934]</b></span></a> They who have turned their back on wealth and wife<br />
							And child, and left their home, if they but get<br />
							Spoon-alms, will do things that beseem them not.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v935"><span class="f2 c"><b>[935]</b></span></a> They eat until they are replete, then down<br />
							They lie supine, and when awake, discourse<br />
							Concerning matters which the Master blamed.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v936"><span class="f2 c"><b>[936]</b></span></a> All arts and handicrafts they highly rate<br />
							And practise: - such are bhikkhus' duties deemed,<br />
							The while from inner conquest they abstain.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v937"><span class="f2 c"><b>[937]</b></span></a> And clay and oil and powder for the bath,<br />
							Water and food and lodging they present<br />
							To laymen, in the hope of richer alms;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v938"><span class="f2 c"><b>[938]</b></span></a> Yea, toothsticks also and <i>kapiṭṭha</i> fruit,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Petals of flowers to chew, and curries choice,<br />
							Mangoes<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> and cocoanut, myrobalan.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v939"><span class="f2 c"><b>[939]</b></span></a> In drug-purveying they as doctors be,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
							In business matters like the laity,<br />
							Like courtezans do they parade their gear,<br />
							And play the lord like any noble squire.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v940"><span class="f2 c"><b>[940]</b></span></a> <a id="pg334"><span class="f2 g"><b>[334]</b></span></a> Adulterators they, tricksters and cheats,<br />
							Unscrupulous, by many stratagems,<br />
							In things of this world freely they indulge,</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v941"><span class="f2 c"><b>[941]</b></span></a> Pursuing ways and methods fit for fraud,<br />
							Seeking a livelihood<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> by cunning craft,<br />
							They draw together plenteous store of wealth.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v942"><span class="f2 c"><b>[942]</b></span></a> To settle business is the Chapter called,<br />
							Not in the interests of the holy Norm.<br />
							And when they preach to others, 'tis but gain<br />
							That is their motive not the good of men.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v943"><span class="f2 c"><b>[943]</b></span></a> Many there be without the Order's fold<br />
							Who brawl and quarrel o'er the Order's gains:<br />
							Insolent spirits they, all unashamed<br />
							To live on offerings to others given.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v944"><span class="f2 c"><b>[944]</b></span></a> Some too there are who lacking piety,<br />
							Though with head shaved, and with the yellow robe,<br />
							Yearn all the while to be revered,<br />
							And hanker after favours, treats, and gifts.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v945"><span class="f2 c"><b>[945]</b></span></a> Thus when so much as now is fallen away,<br />
							No easy thing it is, as it was then,<br />
							Either to touch and win the unattained,<br />
							Or to hold fast what hath been touched and won.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v946"><span class="f2 c"><b>[946]</b></span></a> As one who shoeless walks in thorny brake,<br />
							Calling up heedfulness at every step,<br />
							So should the sage in township make his tour.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v947"><span class="f2 c"><b>[947]</b></span></a> Remembering the saints of other days,<br />
							And recollecting how it was they lived,<br />
							E'en though to-day be but the after-time,<br />
							He may yet win the Ambrosial Way of Peace.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v948"><span class="f2 c"><b>[948]</b></span></a> <i>Thus in the sal-wood spake the good Friar,<br />
							Well-trained and practised as to his faculties.<br />
							Then to the Saint came the Peace of the Passing-<br />
							Came to the Seer for whom was no rebirth.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> In the great wood of <i>sāl</i> trees (Commentary, 948). There was a 'Mahavana' at Kapilavatthu, at Vesālī, and on the Nerañjara in Magadha. Pārāpariya was a Sāvatthī Thera; hence one cannot identify the wood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> So the Commentary. Ver. 926-8 show the <i>Ariyavaṃsapaṭipadā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The three foregoing <i>gāthās</i> are full of difficulties, which, for me, are not always made intelligible by the Commentary, <i>Upaṭṭhita-vivekīya</i> is <i>suvisuddhasīlacārā pi samānā. Sesadhammakā</i> is, lit. 'remainder-of-Norm-ish.' 'Consciences' is interpolated. For <i>sayaṃgahe,</i> etc., <i>sasangāme</i> is <i>suggested,</i> as the battle-cry of Māra, captain of the <i>kilesas.</i> These, standing for evil or sin in general are greed, hate, dullness, conceit, error, perplexity, sloth, distraction, impudence, imprudence. Dr. Neumann cites only the first, over-simplifying the evil conditions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Abstemiousness, lying on the side only, and avoidance of certain topics belonged to a bhikkhu's duties. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Bud. Psy.,</i> p. 858; <i>Dialogues,</i> i. 245 (for 'heroes,' understand 'champions, athletes'); <i>Ang. Nik.,</i> i. 114; <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/mn.016.rhyt.bs_5.htm#pg227"><i>Bud. Suttas,</i> 227.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Apparently a kind of apple. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Milinda,</i> i. 202. Identified in Childers's Dictionary as <i>Feronia elephantum.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Mangoes, the Commentary says, typify many fruits, such as citrons, cocoanuts, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The practice of medicine and surgery for gain is disallowed for bhikkhus (<i>Dialogues,</i> i. 25 <i>f.</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Jīvikattha</i> (where Dr. Neumann's rendering is ingenious, if strained) is paraphrased by <i>jīvikappayojanā; ājīvahetukā.</i></p>
