					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī as the son of a certain very eminent brahmin, he was called, when adult, after his family name Pārāpara, 'the Pārāpariya' <i>(Pārā-parite)</i>.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Well educated in brahmin lore and accomplishments, he went one day into the Jeta Grove Vihāra, at the Master's preaching hour, and took his seat at the fringe of the assembly. The Master, contemplating his character, <a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> taught the Sutta, called 'Practice of Faculties,'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> whereupon Pārāpariya found faith and entered the Order. After learning the Sutta by heart, he pondered over the meaning, thinking: 'In verses the meaning would appear so and so.' Thus pondering on the subject of sense-perception he established insight, and in due time won arahantship. Later he expressed his meditations in verse as follows:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v726"><span class="f2 c"><b>[726]</b></span></a> To a Brother came these musings,<br />
							To the bhikkhu Pārāpariya,<br />
							As he sat alone, secluded,<br />
							World-detached and meditating:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v727"><span class="f2 c"><b>[727]</b></span></a> What is there of course or order,<br />
							What is there in rite, or conduct,<br />
							Which may make a man accomplish<br />
							That which to himself is owing,<br />
							Nor work harm on any other?</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v728"><span class="f2 c"><b>[728]</b></span></a> Lo! the parts and powers of humans<br />
							Make for welfare and for evil:<br />
							Powers unguarded make for evil,<br />
							Guarded powers make for welfare.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v729"><span class="f2 c"><b>[729]</b></span></a> One who guardeth parts and powers,<br />
							One who tendeth parts and powers,<br />
							He may do to self his duty,<br />
							Nor work harm on any other.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v730"><span class="f2 c"><b>[730]</b></span></a> If he go with unrestrained<br />
							Power of sight among sense-objects, <a id="pg296"><span class="f2 g"><b>[296]</b></span></a> All the evil ne'er discerning,<br />
							He doth not escape from sorrow.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v731"><span class="f2 c"><b>[731]</b></span></a> If he go with unrestrained<br />
							Power of hearing sounds about him,<br />

							He doth not escape from sorrow.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v732"><span class="f2 c"><b>[732]</b></span></a> If in divers kinds of odours<br />
							He indulge, voluptuously,<br />
							Way of refuge ne'er discerning,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							He doth not escape from sorrow.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v733"><span class="f2 c"><b>[733]</b></span></a> Taste of sour and sweet and bitter<br />
							Relishing and pondering over,<br />

							Touching, feeling, pondering over,<br />

							Findeth divers forms of sorrow.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v735"><span class="f2 c"><b>[735]</b></span></a> Yea, who in these sense-impressions<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Connected with, perhaps, but not identical with, the Pārāpariya of <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p116">CXVI.</a> of the Rājagaha Pārāparas. This one is the Pārāpariya of <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p257">CCLVII.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The only Sutta I can discover with this title <i>(Indriya-bhāvana)</i> is <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p152">the last Sutta in the <i>Majjhima Nikāya.</i></a> This refers to the methods used by the brahmin teacher Pārāsariya, and then gives the method of 'faculty-training' taught in the 'Ariyan Vinaya,' the Buddha speaking (at Kajangalā, not Sāvatthī), and the interlocutors being Uttara, the brahmin's pupil, and Ānanda. Identity of subject is the one thing connecting Sutta and poem. There is no identity of treatment, and the two problems are set up: (1) Was Pārāpariya paraphrasing another version? (2) Was Pārāpariya Pārāsariya himself?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The Commentary supports the reading <i>na hi muccati,</i> altered by Neumann.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Dr. Neumann's 'Und nicht die freie Höhe sieht' is perhaps unnecessarily free, and is scarcely a good antithesis to fragrant odours, as anyone knows who has left a malodorous Alpine village for the odours of the flower-covered uplands in June.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> 'As one greedy of sweet things licking the edge of a razor' (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Lit., streams - <i>i.e.,</i> her visible shape, etc., objects of sense (Commentary). The Pali is more refined than the Neumann German version, and the dragging in again of the maligned concrete 'Weib'- 'Wo nieder man zum Weibe sinkt' - is entirely unwarranted by the Pali.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The Commentary upholds the <i>atho</i> (in exegesis <i>tato</i>) <i>sīdati saññutaṃ.</i> adding 'if he lays hold of good of a temporal kind.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammagatā rati</i> - lit., set on the Norm.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Redundant <i>padas,</i> omitted in translating, have got into the Pali.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Here again the German translation misses the point. Satisfaction with the five modes of sensuous pleasure is to be ejected by the five modes of spiritual sense, sense-powers or faculties by spiritual powers. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p15">XV.,</a> n. 2, and <i>Compendium,</i> p. 180. <i>Cf.</i> above, verse 725, <i>n.</i> There is a play on words in <i>āṇi,</i> nail, <i>anīgho,</i> flawless, untranslatable in English.</p>
