					<p>Reborn in the time of our Exalted One at <i>Rājagaha,</i> as a brahmin, he was in his old age unable to perform his various duties. Being passed over,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he went to the Master and revealed his needs. The Master, contemplating his graduation in essential conditions, ordered Sāriputta to admit him. Soon after that he won arahantship. And thereafter, keeping near the Master, he became pre-eminent among those who, deriving from the Master's teaching,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> could speak impromptu.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg116"><span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span></a> Now one day seeing how want of self-training occasioned governance by the passions, he exhorted thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v133"><span class="f2 c"><b>[133]</b></span></a> E'en as into an ill-roofed house the rain<br />
							Doth pierce and penetrate continually,<br />
							So into mind by exercise untrained<br />
							Doth passion ever pierce and penetrate.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v134"><span class="f2 c"><b>[134]</b></span></a> And as into a well-roofed house no rain<br />
							Doth pierce and penetrate continually.<br />
							So into mind by calm and insight trained<br />
							Doth passion never pierce and penetrate.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The passage assigning him pre-eminence is then quoted from <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/01_ones/an01.188-295.pali.bd.htm#p233">Ang., i. 25.</a> <i>Cf.</i> with Vangīsa's similar but not identical pre-eminence, Ps. CCLXIV. This Thera is possibly identical with the 'venerable Rādha' addressed in many short discourses of the <i>Saɱyutta</i> (iii. 79, 188 <i>ff.;</i> iv. 48 <i>f.</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> 'Exercise,' 'calm and insight' - in the text <i>bhāvanā</i> - the collective name for the systematized effort in self training of the disciple who seeks perfection (<i>Bud. Psy.,</i> p. 261, n. 2). Specified as 'calm and insight' in the Commentary. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Compendium,</i> p. 202 <i>ff.</i></p>
