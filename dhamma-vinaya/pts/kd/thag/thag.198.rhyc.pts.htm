					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a caravan-leaders' family, his parents called him Rājadatta ('given by the king'), because they had obtained him through praying to Vessavana, the great firmament deity.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Come of age, he once took 500 carts of merchandise to Rājagaha. Now there he squandered all his money, spending a thousand a day on a beautiful courtesan, so that he was penniless and had not enough to eat, and wandered about in wretchedness. So he came with other laymen to the Bamboo Grove, where the Master sat teaching the Norm to a great congregation. And Rājadatta, seated at the fringe of the assembly, heard and believed, and entered the Order. Undertaking the Dhutangas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> he dwelt in a charnel-field.</p>

					<p>Now another caravan-leader also spent his thousand on the courtesan, and wore on his hand a ring of great value, which she coveted. She got men to steal it, but the owner's servants told the police,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and they raided her house, slew her, and cast her body into the charnel-field.</p>

					<p>The Thera Rājadatta, walking therein to find a foul object for meditation, noticed this corpse. For a while <a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> he concentrated his attention, but the portions of her yet unmangled by dogs and jackals distracted him and all but overmastered him. Much distraught, he exhorted his heart, and went away for a brief space; then recommencing, he induced <i>jhāna,</i> confirmed his insight, and so won arahantship.</p>

					<p>Thereupon, reflecting on his success and filled with zest and joy, he said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v315"><span class="f2 c"><b>[315]</b></span></a> A bhikkhu to the charnel-field had gone,<br />
							And there he saw a woman's body cast<br />
							Untended 'mid the dead, the food of worms.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v316"><span class="f2 c"><b>[316]</b></span></a> Most men had felt repugnance at the sight,<br />
							Seeing the corpse, the poor dead evil thing.<br />
							In me was sensual passion manifest,<br />
							And I became as blind and lost control.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v317"><span class="f2 c"><b>[317]</b></span></a> But swifter from that place than seething rice<br />
							Could boiling overflow, I turned and fled;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Aside elsewhere I took my seat cross-legged,<br />
							In heedful and discriminating mood.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v318"><span class="f2 c"><b>[318]</b></span></a> Thereon arose in me the deeper thought:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Attention to the fact and to the cause.<br />
							The misery of it all was manifest.<br />
							Distaste, indifference the mind possessed;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v319"><span class="f2 c"><b>[319]</b></span></a> And so my heart was set at liberty.<br />
							O see the seemly order of the Norm!<br />
							The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,<br />
							And all the Buddha bids us do is done.</p>
