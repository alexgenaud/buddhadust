					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, as a son of King Bimbisāra, he was named Sīlavat. When he was come of age, his brother Ajātasattu was king, and wished to put him to death, but was unable, because Sīlavat was in his last span of life, and had not won arahantship.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Then the Exalted One, discerning what was going on, sent Moggallāna the Great to fetch him. And Prince Sīlavat alighted from his elephant, and did obeisance to the Exalted One. Then the latter taught him, adapting the doctrine to his temperament, so that the youth won faith, entered the Order, and in due time became an arahant. He dwelt in Kosala, and when Ajātasattu sent men to murder him, he taught them and converted them, so that they, too, joined the Order. And he preached to them thus:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> I was tempted to retain the pretty word <i>sīla</i> for our more cumbrous 'morality,' etc. 'Virtue' is more elegant, but a little vague. <i>Sīla</i> is moral <i>habit,</i> habitual good, or moral conduct - the conduct of one who does not hurt or rob living things, is sexually straight, truthful, and gentle of speech, and sober as to drink. That is all. Such conduct is only the essential basis of the higher life. The sermon is addressed to hired assassins, not to bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Success as man, as god, or in Nibbāna (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Abhibhāsanaɱ</i> means either; the Commentary reads the latter meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> 'In fording the great river (or sea) of Nibbāna' (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The Commentary maintains that <i>abbhutay,</i> wondrous, means <i>abhejjaɱ,</i> unbreakable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Lit., from one quarter (of the compass) to another, so acceptable to all men are virtuous qualities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Sambalaɱ</i> is illustrated by the <i>puṭabhattaɱ,</i> or leaf-wrapped pudding taken by a traveller.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> See note 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Dummano</i> and its opposite are usually rendered 'gloomy' and 'cheerful,' but the context demands an ethical rendering. The Commentary paraphrases by <i>pāpadhammo,</i> etc., and <i>kalyānadhammo.</i></p>
