					<p>His story (in this life) is like that of Añjana-vaniya, with this difference: while striving for insight he was walking by the fields, and took shelter from the rain in the little empty hut of the field-watchman, and there won arahantship. Thereupon the watchman came and said: 'Who is in the hut?' The answer was: 'A bhikkhu is in the hut,' and the rest of the verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v56"><span class="f2 c"><b>[56]</b></span></a> Who's in my little hut? A brother 'tis,<br />
							Who in thy little hut, all passions tamed,<br />
							Hath throughly set his mind. Know this, O friend,<br />
							'Twas not for naught thou mad'st thy little hut!</p>

					<p>Then the watchman said: 'Luck indeed for me, good luck indeed is mine, that your honour should have come into my little hut and be sitting there!'</p>

					<p>And the Exalted One heard their converse by his celestial <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> hearing, and discerned the watchman's pleasure. And he addressed these verses to him:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Within the hut a brother dwells, peace in his heart, purged of all taint.<br />
							Fruit of this deed shall be to thee: lord of the gods thou'll come to be<br />
							Six times, ay, seven, lord of the gods, ruler over celestial realms,<br />
							Thereafter all thy passions tamed, a Silent Buddha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> thou shalt be.</p>

					<p>From that time the Thera began to be called Kuṭivihārin.</p>
