					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age, in Aṇguttarāpa,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> in a brahmin family, at the brahmin village of Āpaṇa, he was named Sela. And he dwelt there when adult, proficient in the three Vedas and in brahmin arts, teaching mantras to 300 brahmin youths. Now at that time the Master, leaving <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a>, toured in Anguttarāpa with 1,250 bhikkhus. And divining the maturity of insight in Sela and his pupils, he halted at a certain wood. Then Keniya, the ascetic, having invited the Master and his band for the following day, made preparation of much food. And Sela with his 300 visited the hermitage and asked: 'What now, Keniya, is a minister of the King expected?' and so on. Keniya replied: 'I have invited the Buddha, the Exalted One for to-morrow.' Now Sela, thrilled with joyful enthusiasm at the word 'Buddha,' sought out the Master straightway with his youths, and after exchange of courtesies seated himself at one side. Contemplating the Exalted One, he thought: 'He has all the marks of one who is either a world-emperor, or a Buddha rolling back the veil of the world; yet I know not whether this religious Brother be a Buddha or not. But I have heard that they who are Exalted 0nes, Arahants, Buddhas supreme, reveal themselves when their praises are uttered; for one who is not such a Buddha, when some one in his presence praises the virtues of a Buddha, is irritated and dissatisfied, because he has not won the <a id="pg311"><span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span></a> serene confidence of Buddhas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and cannot endure the allusions.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> What if I were now to praise the Samana Gotama to his face with suitable verses? So he began:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v818"><span class="f2 c"><b>[818]</b></span></a> O thou of perfect form and beauty rare,<br />
							Of fairest parts<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> and lovely to behold,<br />
							Exalted One! thy colour like fine gold,<br />
							Thou valiant spirit, with the dazzling teeth,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v819"><span class="f2 c"><b>[819]</b></span></a> Whose body shows the features that betray<br />
							The man of perfectly adjusted parts,<br />
							Yea, all the traits that mark the Super-Man;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v820"><span class="f2 c"><b>[820]</b></span></a> Thou with the eyes so clear, thy countenance<br />
							So fair, broad,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> straight, majestic, thou dost shine<br />
							As doth the sun, the centre thou of all<br />
							The chosen band of brethren gathered round.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v821"><span class="f2 c"><b>[821]</b></span></a> Thou bhikkhu noble of aspect, whose skin<br />
							Resembleth gold, say, what is friar's life<br />
							To thee with presence so supremely fair?</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v822"><span class="f2 c"><b>[822]</b></span></a> A Prince thou dost deserve to be, a Bull<br />
							Drawing the chariot of the world's empire;<br />
							Lord of the earth from end to end foursquare,<br />
							A conqueror, of Jambudīpa chief.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v823"><span class="f2 c"><b>[823]</b></span></a> Nobles and wealthy lords thy vassals be,<br />
							Thou sovran lord of lords, thou king of men,<br />
							Take thou thy power, O Gotama, and reign!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, fulfilling Sela's wish, replied:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v824"><span class="f2 c"><b>[824]</b></span></a> 'A king, O Sela, verily am I;<br />
							King of the Norm, above me there is none.<br />
							<a id="pg312"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span></a> And by my doctrine<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> do I turn the wheel<br />
							Of sovereignty, wheel irreversible.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela to win confirmation spoke again:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v825"><span class="f2 c"><b>[825]</b></span></a> Wholly enlightened thou dost own thyself:<br />
							'King of the Norm, above me there is none<br />
							And by my doctrine do I turn the wheel<br />
							Of sovereignty' - so sayst thou, Gotama.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v826"><span class="f2 c"><b>[826]</b></span></a> Who is the general of my lord the King,<br />
							Disciple following in the Master's steps?<br />
							Who after his example turns the wheel?</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/sariputta.htm">Sāriputta</a> was Beated at the right of the Exalted One, his head shining in beauty like a pile of gold. And showing him the Exalted One said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v827"><span class="f2 c"><b>[827]</b></span></a> 'The wheel I set a-going of the Norm,<br />
							Above which, Sela, there is none, that wheel<br />
							Doth Sāriputta after my example<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> turn,<br />
							Who hath become like Him-who-Thus-hath-Come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v828"><span class="f2 c"><b>[828]</b></span></a> All that which should be known is known by me,<br />
							All culture of the mind, that have I wrought,<br />
							Whate'er should be renounced I have renounced,<br />
							Hence, brahmin! am I Buddha - one Awake.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v829"><span class="f2 c"><b>[829]</b></span></a> <a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> Subdue thy doubts regarding me, brahmin!<br />
							Have faith in me. Hard, hard it is to win<br />
							Repeated seeing - [as thou mayest now] -<br />
							Of them who rise on earth Buddhas Supreme.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v830"><span class="f2 c"><b>[830]</b></span></a> And 'tis of such whose advent in the world<br />
							Is difficult and rare, that I in sooth<br />
							Am one, 0 brahmin! yea, a Buddha I,<br />
							Surgeon and Healer,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> over whom there's none.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v831"><span class="f2 c"><b>[831]</b></span></a> Supreme my place and past compare my work,<br />
							In crushing the assaults of Māra's hosts.
							All that is hostile lieth 'neath my sway,<br />
							And I rejoice for no whence cometh fear.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sela the brahmin, so convinced by the Exalted One as to wish to take orders, said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v832"><span class="f2 c"><b>[832]</b></span></a> 'Now pay good heed, sirs, to the words that He<br />
							Who sees, Healer and Hero, speaks to us,<br />
							Impressive as a forest lion's roar.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v833"><span class="f2 c"><b>[833]</b></span></a> Supreme in place and past compare in work,<br />
							Who crusheth the assaults of Māra's hosts: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v834"><span class="f2 c"><b>[834]</b></span></a> Who that hath seen him would not feel convinced,<br />
							And were he never so obscure of birth?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> He who is fain for me may follow me;<br />
							And whoso is not fain may go his way;<br />
							But I will in this Rule renounce the world,<br />
							'Neath him who is so noble and so wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin youths also, because they had attained to the requisite conditions, replied:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v835"><span class="f2 c"><b>[835]</b></span></a> 'If to thy judgment, sir, this Rule of him.<br />
							The Supreme Buddha, doth commend itself,<br />
							We too will in that Rule renounce the world,<br />
							'Neath him who is so noble and so wise.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> Then Sela, delighted because those youths shared in his resolve, showed them to the Master and asked for ordination:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v836"><span class="f2 c"><b>[836]</b></span></a> These thrice one hundred brahmins with clasped hands<br />
							Beseech thee, O Exalted One, that we<br />
							May lead the holy life beneath thine eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, inasmuch as in past ages Sela, as teacher of just those 300, had sown the root of merit, and now in the last life had produced both his own insight and their maturity, discerned that they were ripe for ordination and said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v837"><span class="f2 c"><b>[837]</b></span></a> 'Well, Sela, is the holy life set forth,<br />
							Clear to be seen and heard; swift is the fruit,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Wherein not futile is the coming forth<br />
							For one who earnestly doth train himself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Exalted One said: 'Come ye, bhikkhus!' And they, by his mystic power endued with the robes and bowl of bhikkhus of long-standing,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> did obeisance and began their studies for insight, attaining arahantship on the seventh day. Thereat they came to the Master and confessed <i>aññā</i> thus, Sela speaking:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v838"><span class="f2 c"><b>[838]</b></span></a> Lo! thou who seest all, 'tis eight days since<br />
							We came and refuge found. In one se'nnight,<br />
							Exalted One! we're trainèd in thy Rule.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v839"><span class="f2 c"><b>[839]</b></span></a> Thou art Buddha! our Master thou! and thou<br />
							The mighty Seer who Māra didst o'erthrow.<br />
							Thou who all evil tendencies hast purged,<br />
							And crossed [the flood of life's eternal sea],<br />
							'Tis thou dost aid the sons of men to cross.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> <a id="v840"><span class="f2 c"><b>[840]</b></span></a>  Thou hast transcended every cause of birth,<br />
							And shattered every poison-growth within,<br />
							Thou even as a lion, grasping nought,<br />
							Hast banished every source of fear and dread.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v841"><span class="f2 c"><b>[841]</b></span></a> Three hundred bhikkhus lo! before thee stand,<br />
							With clasped hands outstretched to honour thee,<br />
							Stretch forth thy feet, O hero! suffer them,<br />
							Thine arahants,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> their Master to salute.</p>
