					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī of a brahmin family, he entered the Order, but from want of mental balance could not concentrate on a given idea.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Now one day going to the town for alms, he saw men conducting running water wherever they wished by digging channels. Within the town he marked out of the corner of his eye<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> how the fletcher fixed the arrow-shaft in his lathe, and leaving with full bowl he saw the chariot-makers planing axle and tire and hub. So entering the Vihāra he dined; then during siesta he pondered on these three modes of taming things, making them his goad, and applying them to his own need of self-mastery. So striving he not long after won arahantship. And connecting those object-lessons with his own heart's taming, he confessed aññā in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v19"><span class="f2 c"><b>[19]</b></span></a> The conduit-makers lead the stream,<br />
							Fletchers coerce the arrow-shaft,<br />
							The joiners mould the wooden plank;<br />
							The self-'tis that the pious tame.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This verse recurs in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p255">CCLV.,</a> and occurs twice in the <i>Dhammapada,</i> being assigned, in the Commentary on that work, to one Paṇḍita-sāmanera at verse 8O, and to Sukha-sāmanera at verse 145. Both are of Sāvatthī also, and both are described as making object-lessons of human skill over matter in the crafts alluded to. But in the former instance the story is much expanded.</p>
