					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age in the country of the Kurus, in the township of Thullakoṭṭhika, as the son of a councillor named Raṭṭhapāla,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>and was called by his family name. Brought up in a large establishment of retainers, he was united, when adolescent, to a suitable wife, and enjoyed a prosperity resembling that of the devas. Now the Exalted One, touring in the Kuru country, came to Thullakoṭṭhika, and Raṭṭhapāla went to hear him teach. Receiving faith, he with great difficulty obtained his parents' leave to renounce the world. Going to the Master, he received ordination from a bhikkhu at the Master's command, and studying diligently developed insight and won arahantship. Thereupon he obtained permission to visit his parents, and went to Thullakoṭṭhika, going from house to house for alms. At his father's house he obtained rancid gruel, but ate it as if it were ambrosia. Invited by his father, he went next day to his home. And <a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> when the ladies in fine array asked him: 'What are the celestial nymphs like, my lord, for whose sake you live the holy life?' he taught them the Norm in connection with impermanence, etc., repulsing their insinuating conduct:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v769"><span class="f3 c"><b>[769]</b></span></a> Behold the tricked-out puppet-shape, a mass<br />
							Of sores, a congeries diseased, and full<br />
							Of many purposes and plans, and yet<br />
							In whom there is no power to persist!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> (769)</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v770"><span class="f3 c"><b>[770]</b></span></a> Behold the tricked-out form, bejewelled, ringed,<br />
							Sheathèd in bones and skinny envelope,<br />
							By help of gear made fine and fair to see!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v771"><span class="f3 c"><b>[771]</b></span></a> Feet dyed with lac, with rouge the lips besmeared:<br />
							All good enough for dull wit of a fool,<br />
							But not for him who seeketh the Beyond!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v772"><span class="f3 c"><b>[772]</b></span></a> The locks in eightfold plait, eyes fringed with black:<br />
							All good enough for dull wit of a fool,<br />
							But not for him who seeketh the Beyond!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v773"><span class="f3 c"><b>[773]</b></span></a> Like a collyrium-pot,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> brand new, embossed,<br />
							The body foul within is bravely decked:<br />
							All good enough for dull wit of a fool,<br />
							But not for him who seeketh the Beyond.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v774"><span class="f3 c"><b>[774]</b></span></a> The trapper set his snare. The deer came not<br />
							Against the net.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> We've eaten of the bait -<br />
							Let's go!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> the while deer trappers make lament.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v775"><span class="f3 c"><b>[775]</b></span></a> Snapt is the hunter's snare! The deer came not<br />
							Against the net. We've eaten of the bait -<br />
							Let's go; the while deer catchers weep and wail.</p>

					<p>Raṭṭhapāla thereupon went through the air<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> to the Antelope Park of King Koravya, and seated himself on a stone slab. Now the Thera's father had had bolts put on <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> his seven doors, and had sent men to prevent him from getting out, and to take off his yellow robes and clothe him in white.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> Hence the Thera's going through the air. Then the king, hearing where he was seated, went to him, and with courteous greeting asked him thus: 'Master Raṭṭhapāla, in this world men renounce it for some kind of misfortune - illness, loss of king, wealth or family. But you who have suffered no such thing, why have you left the world?' Then the Thera replied: 'The world passes away, is transient; the world is without refuge or providence; the world has no stronghold; the world is wanting and destitute, dissatisfied, the slave of craving.' Thus showing his separate condition, he recited a parallel in verse :</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v776"><span class="f3 c"><b>[776]</b></span></a> Men<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> of much wealth I see in the world:-<br />
							Riches acquiring they err in not giving.<br />
							Make out of greed a great hoard of their wealth,<br />
							Yea, hankering yet after ever more pleasures.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v777"><span class="f3 c"><b>[777]</b></span></a> The king having forcibly conquered the earth,<br />
							To the shore of the ocean, holding the land<br />
							This side of the sea, may yet all unsatisfied<br />
							Hanker after the further side also.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v778"><span class="f3 c"><b>[778]</b></span></a> See where both king and full many another man<br />
							Nursing their cravings come to their dying.<br />
							Paupers becoming,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> they put off this body,<br />
							For never content lies in pleasures of this world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v779"><span class="f3 c"><b>[779]</b></span></a> Kinsfolk bewail him with tresses dishevelled,<br />
							Crying: 'Alas! would our kin were immortal!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Him in his shroud envelopt they bear away;<br />
							Raising a pyre they forthwith cremate him.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg305"><span class="f2 g"><b>[305]</b></span></a> <a id="v780"><span class="f3 c"><b>[780]</b></span></a> He lies a-buming, by forks being prodded,<br />
							Clad in one garment, stripped of all riches.<br />
							Never to one who is dying are kinsfolk<br />
							Refuge, nor friends, nay, nor even neighbours.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v781"><span class="f3 c"><b>[781]</b></span></a> His wealth is annexed by his heirs, but the being<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Goeth according to all his past actions.<br />
							Never doth wealth follow after the dying,<br />
							Nor children, nor wife, nor wealth, nor a kingdom.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v782"><span class="f3 c"><b>[782]</b></span></a> Never is long life gotten through riches,<br />
							Nor is old age ever banished by property.<br />
							Brief is this life, all the sages have told us;<br />
							Transient it is, and essentially changing.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v783"><span class="f3 c"><b>[783]</b></span></a> All feel the Touch,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> both the poor and the wealthy;<br />
							Touched is the wise man no less than the fool.<br />
							But the fool, smitten down by his folly, lies prostrate;<br />
							The wise man, when feeling the Touch, never trembles.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v784"><span class="f3 c"><b>[784]</b></span></a> Wherefore far better than riches is wisdom,<br />
							Whereby we arrive even here at the terminus.<br />
							For from not reaching the goal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> the dull-minded<br />
							Work wicked deeds in delusion, reborn<br />
							In spheres whether high or whether of no account.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v785"><span class="f3 c"><b>[785]</b></span></a> Cometh a man to the womb and in other worlds<br />
							Findeth rebirth, being caught in <i>Saŋsāra,</i><br />
							Round sempiternal of livings consecutive;<br />
							Him one of little wit follows believing,<br />
							Cometh to birth both here and in other worlds.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v786"><span class="f3 c"><b>[786]</b></span></a> E'en as a thief who is taken in burglary,<br />
							By his own act is condemned as a criminal,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />
							<a id="pg306"><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span></a> So is the race, after death, in another world,<br />
							By its own doing condemned as a criminal.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v787"><span class="f3 c"><b>[787]</b></span></a> For by the charm, sweet and diverse, of sense-desire,<br />
							One way or other the mind is unbalanced;<br />
							And seeing the evil in sensuous pleasures,<br />
							Therefore, O King, have I gone all forsaking.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v788"><span class="f3 c"><b>[788]</b></span></a> Fall as fruit from the tree all the sons of men,<br />
							Youthful and aged, when breaks down the body,<br />
							This too seeing, O King, have I gone forth.<br />
							Better the safe, sure life of religion.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v789"><span class="f3 c"><b>[789]</b></span></a> Full of high confidence<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> I left the world<br />
							And joined the Order of the Conqueror.<br />
							Blameless my going forth has been, and free<br />
							From debt I live on my allotted share.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v790"><span class="f3 c"><b>[790]</b></span></a> Looking on sense-desires as fire alight.<br />
							On gold and silver as a [noxious] knife,<br />
							[On life] from entry in the womb as ill,<br />
							And on the fearsome peril of the hells: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v791"><span class="f3 c"><b>[791]</b></span></a> Seeing, I say, great evils everywhere,<br />
							Thereat was I with anguish sore beset.<br />
							Then to me, pierced and wounded as I was,<br />
							Came fourfold victory: o'er sense-desires,<br />
							O'er rebirth, error, ignorance, VICTORY!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v792"><span class="f3 c"><b>[792]</b></span></a> The Master hath my fealty and love,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And all the Buddha's bidding hath been done.<br />
							Low have I laid the heavy load I bore,<br />
							Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg307"><span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span></a> <a id="v793"><span class="f3 c"><b>[793]</b></span></a> The Good for which I bade the world farewell,<br />
							And left the home to dwell where home was not,<br />
							That highest Good have I accomplishèd,<br />
							And every bond and fetter is destroyed.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Then the Thera, having thus taught the Norm to King Koravya, went back to the Master. And He thereafter, in the assembly of the Ariyans, declared Raṭṭhapāla foremost of those who had left the world through faith.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span></p>
