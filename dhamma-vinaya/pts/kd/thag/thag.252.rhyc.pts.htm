					<p>The story of this venerable one is given in <a href="thag.214.rhyc.pts.htm">Canto VI. (CCXIV.),</a> wherein the Thera, established in arahantship, uttered a psalm by way of teaching his kinsfolk about the Path. But in this poem the Thera, not yet an arahant, had asked the Master for doctrine in brief, and he received this response: 'What think you, Mālunkyā's son, things which you have never seen, heard, smelt, tasted, touched, or perceived, of which you have no present impression, nor of which you wish you might have sensations and perception: - do you feel desire, or longing, or fondness for them?' 'No, lord.' 'Here, then, Mālunkyā's son, when you do get any sensation or perception of things, you will have just the sensations or perceptions only. And inasmuch as this is so, and you will get no [greed, ill-will, or illusion] thereby, or therein, either here or elsewhere, or hereafter, this, even this, is the end of pain.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg308"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span></a> And Mālunkyā's son, showing how well he had learnt that doctrine so summarized, expressed it in these verses:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> That is, you can use sense and intellect without craving being engendered. I have inserted the bracketed words from Buddhaghosa's Commentary on this passage in his <i>Sāratthapakāsinī. Cf.</i> the Thera's emphasis on <i>taṇhā</i> in his former poem. The Commentary follows almost verbatim the Sutta <i>Sangayha</i> in the <i>'Saḷātyatana-Saṃyutta'</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p95">(<i>Saṇy. Nik.,</i> iv. 72),</a> where the poem also occurs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/thag/thag.1-264.pali.bd.htm#p98">verse 98</a> and n. 'Lucid thought' is better for sati than 'self-control,' to which <i>sati</i> conduces.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Vihesā,</i> aroused, says the Commentary, when the object is the reverse of agreeable. More probably the enmity born of greed. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 55.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Each sense is given a separate stanza. [Ed. here included]</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammaṇ ñatvā - i.e.,</i> the aspect of cognition as an act of mind, supplementing, or, it may be, independent of, sense-impressions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The rest of consciousness follows its <i>gocara,</i> or normal procedure (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> As before, each sense is assigned a complete stanza. [Ed. here complete] The Buddha, according to the <i>Saṃyutta Nikāya,</i> accords warm praise to Mālunkyā's son's rendering.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> This is apparently what Mrs. Rhys Davids intends to be the object of the mind-sense.</p>
