					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in a burgess's family, he was named Sirimat (Faustus) because of his family's good fortune and constant success. His younger brother, as increaser of that good fortune, was named Sirivaḍḍha (growth of luck).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> They both saw the majesty of the Buddha when the Jeta Grove was presented, believed, and entered the Order. Sirivaḍḍha, though at first he won no abnormal powers, was honoured and fêted by laity and <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> recluses. But Sirimat, through defective karma, was little honoured; nevertheless, exercising himself in calm and insight, he soon won the sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i></p>

					<p>Now the ordinary bhikkhus and novices, not knowing Sirimat was an Ariyan, continued to disparage him and to honour his brother. Then the Thera, blaming their faulty judgment, said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v159"><span class="f2 c"><b>[159]</b></span></a> Others may laud and honour him<br />
							Whose self is uncontrolled.<br />
							Surely amiss their praise is given,<br />
							Since self is uncontrolled.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v160"><span class="f2 c"><b>[160]</b></span></a> Others may chide and censure him<br />
							Whose self is well controlled.<br />
							Surely amiss their blame is given,<br />
							Since self is well controlled.</p>

					<p>Then Sirivaḍḍha, hearing him, was agitated, and establishing insight, not long after he also completed his salvation. And they who had blamed the Thera sought his forgiveness.</p>
