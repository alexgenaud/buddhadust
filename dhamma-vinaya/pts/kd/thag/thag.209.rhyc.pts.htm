					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a Magadhan brahmin's family, he was called by his family name: Kosiya. Come of age, he often went to hear the General of the Norm teaching,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and thereby, believing in the doctrine, entered the Order, and in due course won arahantship. Thereupon reviewing his achievement, he extolled the venerableness and determining power for good of the wise in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v370"><span class="f2 c"><b>[370]</b></span></a> He that is valiant and learn'd in the word of the masters,<br />
							Therein can rest<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and therefor can cherish affection,<br />
							Him ye may call devoted<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and wise: thus he may be<br />
							One that winneth distinction in knowledge of doctrines.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg205"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span></a> <a id="v371"><span class="f2 c"><b>[371]</b></span></a> Him, whose steadfast philosophy hardship unparalleled<br />
							Testing has no power to disturb or bewilder,<br />
							Him ye may call strong-willed and wise: thus he may be<br />
							One that winneth distinction in knowledge of doctrines.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v372"><span class="f2 c"><b>[372]</b></span></a> He who abideth as ocean unyielding, unfathomed<br />
							As to his insight in problems subtle and delicate,<br />
							Him ye may call inexpugnable,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> wise: thus he may be<br />
							One that winneth distinction in knowledge of doctrines.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v373"><span class="f2 c"><b>[373]</b></span></a> Erudite, one who beareth the Word in his memory,<br />
							Practiser he of all doctrine, greater and lesser,<br />
							Him ye may call all this and wise: thus he may be<br />
							One that winneth distinction in knowledge of doctrines.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v374"><span class="f2 c"><b>[374]</b></span></a> He who knoweth the meaning of that which is spoken,<br />
							Knowing the meaning, shapeth his actions accordingly.<br />
							'Meaning-within-side '<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> call him and wise: thus he may be<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Bhattimā,</i> meaning either this, or one who can distinguish (<i>vide</i> Childers). The former meaning seems required by 'can cherish affection,' but I doubt if this (later very prevalent) meaning occurs elsewhere in the <i>Piṭakas.</i> The Commentary's remark is: <i>So ti so gaūnaɱ vacaññā dhīro, so yathānusiṭṭkaɱ paṭipattiyā, tattha, bhattimā ca nāma hoti.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sutta-Nipāta,</i> iv. 13, 11, where the line occurs. It does not seem to me to require the alteration suggested by Dr. Neumann. <i>Visesi assa: viaesavā siyā.</i> <i>Cy.</i></p>
