					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, in a family of caravan-leaders, he was named Godatta. After his father's death he arranged his estate, and taking 500 carts full of wares travelled about, maintaining himself by trading. One day an ox fell on the road while drawing its cart, and his men could not raise it, so he himself went and smote <a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> it severely. Then the ox, incensed at his ruthlessness, assumed a human voice and said: 'Godatta, this long time have I unreservedly given my strength to draw your burdens, but to-day when I was unable and fell, you hurt me badly. Well then! Wherever henceforth you are reborn, may I be there as your enemy able to hurt you!' Godatta was thrilled at hearing this, and thought: 'What do I in this way of life who have thus hurt living things?' And he divested himself of all his property, and took orders under a certain great Thera, in due course attaining arahantship.</p>

					<p>Now one day as he was abiding in the bliss of fruition, he discoursed to Ariyan groups, both lay and religious, on worldly wisdom:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v659"><span class="f2 c"><b>[659]</b></span></a> E'en as the mettled brute of noble breed,<br />
							Yoked to his load, drawing his load along,<br />
							Though worn by burden past his powers, [unfair],<br />
							Breaks not away, revolting from his bonds,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v660"><span class="f2 c"><b>[660]</b></span></a> So they in whom, as water in the sea,<br />
							Wisdom abounds, despise not other men;<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v661"><span class="f2 c"><b>[661]</b></span></a> Living in time, come 'neath the power of time;<br />
							Subject to dread concerning future life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Men go their ways to pain and misery,<br />
							Yea, here below the sons of men do mourn.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v662"><span class="f2 c"><b>[662]</b></span></a> Elated by some pleasant hap, by ill<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> It is interesting to contrast the protest of the Indian ox with that of the Hebrew ass of Balak. According to the Commentary, the gist of the 'Ariyan rule' is the sporting maxim that, whether we do or do not congratulate ourselves on our successes, we are not to belittle <i>(avambhanaŋ)</i> others when we fail. Herein, in either case, rich wisdom makes a man happy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> More literally, subject to becoming and not becoming.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.,</i> craving <i>(taṇhā),</i> who sews life on to life (<i>Bud. Psy.,</i> p. 278).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This last <i>(metri causá)</i> from the Commentary: <i>anabhibhavaniyato.</i></p>
