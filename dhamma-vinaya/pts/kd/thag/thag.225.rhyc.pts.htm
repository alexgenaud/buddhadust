					<p>Reborn in the time of our Master at Sāvatthi in a wealthy family, he was named Bhaddiya, but from his extreme shortness, he was known as Lakuntaka (Dwarf)-Bhaddiya. Hearing the Master preach, he entered the Order, and becoming learned and eloquent, he taught others their work with a sweet voice. Now on a festival-day, a certain woman of the town, driving with a brahmin in a chariot, saw the Thera and laughed, showing her teeth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The Thera, taking that row of teeth as an object-sign, evoked jhāna, and on that basis established insight and became a Non-Returner.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> And after practising mindfulness regarding the body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> admonished by the Captain of the Norm,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> he was established in arahantship. Later he thus confessed <i>aññā:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v466"><span class="f2 c"><b>[466]</b></span></a> Beyond the gardens of Ambataka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							In woodland wild, craving and craving's root<br />
							Withdrawn, and rapt in deepest reverie,<br />
							There happy sits fortunate Bhaddiya.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v467"><span class="f2 c"><b>[467]</b></span></a> <a id="pg231"><span class="f2 g"><b>[231]</b></span></a> And some are charmed by cymbals,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> lutes and drums,<br />
							And I in leafy shadow of my trees<br />
							Do dwell entranced by the Buddha's Rule.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v468"><span class="f2 c"><b>[468]</b></span></a> Let but the Buddha grant one boon to me,<br />
							And if that boon were mine, I'd choose for all<br />
							Perpetual study in control of self.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v469"><span class="f2 c"><b>[469]</b></span></a> They who decry me for my shape, and they<br />
							Who listen spell-bound to my voice, such folk<br />
							In toils of lust and impulse know me not.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v470"><span class="f2 c"><b>[470]</b></span></a> The fool hemmed in on every side knows not<br />
							The inner life, nor sees the things without,<br />
							And by a voice forsooth is led away.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v471"><span class="f2 c"><b>[471]</b></span></a> And if the inner life he knoweth not,<br />
							Yet can discern the things that are without,<br />
							Watching alone the outer fruits that come,<br />
							He also by a voice is led away.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v472"><span class="f2 c"><b>[472]</b></span></a> He, who both understands the inner life,<br />
							And doth discern the things that are without,<br />
							Clear-visioned, by no voice is led away.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Mutingehi</i> means a variety of drum. Our drum nomenclature is insufficient for the number of Indian species of this instrument. The sweet voice probably went with a musical ear, and this is why he ranks music as second only to his own supreme source of delight.</p>

This distinction is said to have been the result of an aspiration made in past ages, before Padumuttara Buddha. The evolutionary momentum of this caused him rebirth, under Vipassi Buddha, as a 'variegated-feathered cuckoo' <i>(citta-pattakokila),</i> a sweet warbler in India. The Cy. does not allude to the realization of his wish, but the poem betrays it. 'Study in control of self': <i>kāyagatāsatiŋ.</i></p>
