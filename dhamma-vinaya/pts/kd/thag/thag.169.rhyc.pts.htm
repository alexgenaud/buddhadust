					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a wealthy family of Kosala and named Sandhita, he heard, when come of age, a sermon on impermanence, and this alarmed him so that he entered the Order. Through the maturity of his knowledge he established insight, and acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i> Recalling his own former life, how after the passing away of Sikhi Buddha he had worshipped at the Bo-tree and acquired discernment of impermanence,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he declared his winning of the goal, by that efficient cause, in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v217"><span class="f2 c"><b>[217]</b></span></a> Beneath the tree-the holy Bodhi-tree-<br />
							Clad in the glory of its vernal green,<br />
							To me musing and mindful came a thought -<br />
							A Buddha-burdened thought.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v218"><span class="f2 c"><b>[218]</b></span></a> 'Tis one and thirty aeons since it came.<br />
							Natheless so fruitful proved that thought in me,<br />
							By dint thereof o'er the intoxicants<br />
							The victory is wrought!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In lamenting that he only heard of that Buddha just as he had passed away. On Sikhi, see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm#pg6"><i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 6.</a> 'Bodhiṁtree' is <i>assatthe,</i> or the species of fig-tree which was Gotama Buddha's Bo-tree. Sikhi's was a kind of mango (see Childers's 'Puṇḍarīka'), and the Commentary is at some pains to explain that <i>assattha</i> had come to stand for Bo-tree associations in general. 'Thought' - <i>saññā, aperçu</i> - is repeated thrice in the text.</p>
