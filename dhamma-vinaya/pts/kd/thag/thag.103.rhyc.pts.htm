					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at the town of Sīlavatī<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> as the son of a councillor, he was named Bandhura.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> And going one day on some business to Sāvatthī, he went with the laity to the Vihāra, heard the Master, believed and entered the Order, and in due time won arahantship. Now to render service to his <i>rāja</i> and so show his gratitude for his success, he went to Sīlavatī and preached the Norm to the <i>rāja,</i> declaring to him the Four Truths. The <i>rāja</i> became a convert, built a great Vihāra in the township, calling it Sudassana, and bestowed it on the Thera with many honours and offerings. The latter handed over everything to the Order, and going on his rounds as before, conceived the wish to go to Sāvatthī. The bhikkhus said: 'Sir, stay with us. If you lack in what you require, we will make it good.' He replied: 'I have no need, friends, of anything out of the way; I keep going on anything I get. I am content with the savour of the Norm,' and uttered this psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Nay, 'tis not this I need, who live in bliss,<br />
							Regaled by sweetest nectar of the Norm.<br />
							Drinking those drops peerless, supreme, shall I<br />
							Forsooth my tongue with poison now acquaint?</p>
