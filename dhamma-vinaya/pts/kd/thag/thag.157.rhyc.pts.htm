					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, as the son of the zemindar<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Poṭiriya, he was named Soṇa. Come of age, he became chief captain of the forces of Bhaddiya, a Sākiyan rāja. Now Bhaddiya having left the world, as will be described below, Soṇa thought: 'If even the rāja has left the world, what have I to do with domestic life?' <a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> So he took orders, but remained sluggish, not given to meditative exercise. On him the Exalted One, dwelling in the Mango Grove at Anupiyā, sent forth his glory, and arousing him to mindfulness uttered admonitory verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v193"><span class="f2 c"><b>[193]</b></span></a> Nay, not for this that thou mayest slumber long,<br />
							Cometh the night in starry garlands wreathed.<br />
							For vigil by the wise this night is here.</p>

					<p>Hearing him, Soṇa was exceedingly agitated, and keeping his shortcomings before the mind, adopted the open-air practice, exercising himself for insight. And he uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v194"><span class="f2 c"><b>[194]</b></span></a> If in the fight my warrior-elephant<br />
							Advanced, 'twere better, fallen from his back,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Dead on the field [and trampled I should lie],<br />
							Than beaten live a captive to the foe.</p>

					<p>So saying, he stirred up insight and won arahantship, and thereupon repeated the Master's words and his own as his confession of <i>aññā.</i></p>

On the vision, <i>cf.</i> several of the first Sisters' psalms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Commentary confirms the reading <i>avapatitaṃ</i> (<i>vide</i> Neumann). The figure is a very natural one for an Indian soldier, and its application is easy. Metaphors from warfare are less frequent in Buddhist than in Christian literature, and the few contained in this work almost exhaust them. 'Trampled' (by the elephant is a Commentarial gloss.</p>
