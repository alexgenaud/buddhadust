					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a wealthy family at Sāvatthī, he found faith, and entering the Order took an exercise, and joined another bhikkhu, both dwelling in the forest. Not far from where they abode, a doe in the thicket had <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> given birth to a fawn. Tending it, her love kept her from going far from it, and lacking grass and water close by she was famished. Seeing her the Thera said: 'Ah, surely this world bound in the bonds of craving suffers sore, unable to cut them!' And taking this feeling as a goad, he developed insight and won arahantship. Thereupon, discerning that his companion was cherishing many wrong thoughts, he admonished him through the parable of the doe, and uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v109"><span class="f2 c"><b>[109]</b></span></a> Not yet doth he, though in retreat he dwell,<br />
							Con o'er the system by that Blest One (planned)<br />
							Who showed compassion for our highest good.<br />
							Still are his powers relaxed and uncontrolled,<br />
							Like woodland doe all tender grown and weak.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Now hearing these words that bhikkhu grew agitated, and expanding insight, in due course won arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This stanza is a notable example, among others, of the extraordinary difficulty attending translation in the absence of the Commentary. Lack of the simple little narrative has landed Dr. Neumann in a very different interpretation, with a strained use of the word <i>pākatindriyo. Pākata = asaŋvuta</i> (Commentary). <i>Cf.</i> <i>Milinda,</i> ii. 72.</p>
