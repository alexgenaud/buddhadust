					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu in a clan of Sākiyan rajas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he was named Bhaddiya. And when adult, he left the world together with Anuruddha and the other four nobles, while the Master was staying at the Mango Grove of Anupiyā. And entering the Order, he won arahantship. Him (as the result of a primeval vow and efforts on his part), the Master in conclave at Jeta Grove, ranked as the best among those bhikkhus who were of aristocratic birth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> And he, dwelling in the bliss of fruition, in the bliss of Nibbāna, while in the forest, beneath a tree, in any lonely spot, was ever breathing forth the exclamation: 'Ah, what happiness! ah, what happiness!' Now bhikkhus hearing him told the Master; to whom Bhaddiya, when summoned, admitted the habit, adding:'Formerly,	lord, <a id="pg316"><span class="f2 g"><b>[316]</b></span></a> when I was ruling my principality, I was well provided with protection, yet even so I was ever fearful, nervous, distrustful. But now that I have renounced all, I am no longer in that state.' And before the Master he uttered his 'lion's roar,' thus:</p>
