					<p>His story resembles that of the Añjana Wood Thera, with this difference: When he had left the world under similar circumstances, he pursued his religious studies in a very old hut. And he thought: 'This old hut is now rotten; I ought to make another.' So he turned his mind to new action.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Then a spirit, seeking salvation, sought to agitate him by uttering this verse, simple in words but profound in meaning:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v57"><span class="f2 c"><b>[57]</b></span></a> This was an ancient hut, say'st thou? To build<br />
							Auother hut, a new one, is thy wish?<br />
							O cast away the longing for a hut!<br />
							New hut will bring new pain, brother, to thee.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>When he heard these words, the Thera grew anxious, and with effort and endeavour establishing insight, soon won arahantship. Thereupon he repeated the verse as that which had spurred him on to victory, and as the confession of his aññā. Because he had attained while in the hut, he, too, became known as Kuṭivihārin.</p>
