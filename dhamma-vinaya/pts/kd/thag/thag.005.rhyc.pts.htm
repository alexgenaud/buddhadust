					(Of the Mallas)</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the Pali by Mrs. C.A.F. Rhys Davids.</p>

					<p>He came to birth in the family of a clansman of the Mallas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at Anupiyā. As a child of seven, he saw the Master when the latter visited his country and home, and was so attracted that he asked his grandmother, his mother having died at his birth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> if he might leave the world under the Master. She brought him to the Master, who bade a bhikkhu ordain him. And the boy, being one in whom past causes and an aspiration were taking effect, realized the Four Paths in succession, in the very act of having his curls cut off.</p>

					<p><a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a>  And when the Master left the Mallas' country for Rājagaha, Dabba, meditating alone, and desirous of devoting his body to the service of the Order, considered that he might both apportion night's lodging and direct to meals. The Master sanctioned his doing so, and his success herein, and his supernormal power herein, lighting the brethren to their lodgings with his shining finger, is told in the Pali narrative.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>But it was after the baseless calumny,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> wherewith the bhikkhas who followed Mettiya and Bhummajaka sought to ruin him, had been condemned by the Order, that the Brother, conscious of his virtuous compassion for others, uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v5"><span class="f2 c"><b>[5]</b></span></a> Once hard to tame, by taming tamed is now<br />
							Dabba, from doubts released, content, serene.<br />
							Victor is Dabba now, and void of fears;<br />
							Perfected<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> he and staunch in steadfastness.</p>

					<p>Thus verily did the venerable Brother Dabba utter his psalm.</p>

Here the former species is meant, inasmuch as there had been an entire putting away by the Path of everything that should be put away.' <i>Cf.</i> <i>Compendium of Philosophy,</i> p. 108: my <i>Buddhism,</i> p. 191.</p>
