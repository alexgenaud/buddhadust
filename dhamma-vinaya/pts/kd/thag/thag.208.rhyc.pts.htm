					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the country of Avanti in the family of a very wealthy councillor, he was given the name of Soṇa. Wearing ear-jewelry worth a crore, he became known as <i>Koṭi-,</i> or <i>Kuṭi-kanna</i> (Crore-ears).<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Grown up, he became a landowner, and when the venerable Kaccāna the Great<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> stayed near his house, he ministered to his wants, learned the Norm, and finally growing disturbed, entered the Order through him. Collecting with <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> great difficulty a company of ten, he soon took leave of the Thera to go to <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> and salute the Master. Being admitted to pass the night in the Master's portion, and in the morning invited to recite, he was commended for the sixteen <i>Aṭṭhakas.</i> And when the verse -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>'Seeing the evils of a worldly life,'</i></p>

					<p>was finished, he developed insight and won arahantship.</p>

					<p>And when he had obtained the Master's consent to the three matters which Kaccāna the Great had commissioned him to ask, he returned to his own dwelling-place, and told the Thera his instructor. This is recorded more fully in the <i>Udāna</i> and <i>Aŋguttara Commentaries,</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> but there it is said that he attained arahantship while studying under his teacher.</p>

					<p>Anon, while dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, he reviewed his achievement, and full of joy he breathed out these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v365"><span class="f2 c"><b>[365]</b></span></a> Not only did I ordination win,<br />
							Emancipated am I, sane, immune;<br />
							Yea, him have I now seen, th' Exalted One,
							And where he dwelt, there with him did I lodge.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v366"><span class="f2 c"><b>[366]</b></span></a> Far through the night he stayed beneath the sky,<br />
							Then, versed in everything's abiding-place,<br />
							The Master in his chamber went to rest.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v367"><span class="f2 c"><b>[367]</b></span></a> His robe spread Gotama<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and laid him down,<br />
							Like unto lion in a rocky cave,<br />
							For whom all fear and dread have passed away.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v368"><span class="f2 c"><b>[368]</b></span></a> Thereafter in the presence of the Chief,<br />
							The Wake, did Soṇa, framing goodly speech,<br />
							Disciple of the Buddha, speak the Norm.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg204"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></a> <a id="v369"><span class="f2 c"><b>[369]</b></span></a> Well doth he know the factors of this life,<br />
							Well doth he cultivate the [Ariyan] Way,<br />
							So, having won to that most perfect Peace,<br />
							Shall he complete becoming,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> sane, immune.</p>
