					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthi,</a> in a brahmin's family, he was named Upavāna. He saw at the Jeta Grove presentation the majesty of the Buddha, and entering the Order, practised for insight, and won sixfold abhinna.</p>

					<p>Now Upavāna. became attendant on the Exalted One.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> And at that time the Exalted One was attacked by cramp. And Devahita, a brahmin lay-friend of the Thera, living at Sāvatthi, was supplying him with the four necessaries. Seeing him come with bowl and robe, Devahita discerned that he needed something different and said: 'Let your reverence be supplied. What do you need?' And Upavāna. answered:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v185"><span class="f2 c"><b>[185]</b></span></a> The Arahant, the Well-Come of all men,<br />
							The Holy Sage, he suffereth sore with wind.<br />
							If there be any water heated here,<br />
							O give it to me, brahmin, for the Sage.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v186"><span class="f2 c"><b>[186]</b></span></a> Revered by them to whom we reverence owe,<br />
							Cherished by them who claim our pious care,<br />
							Honoured by them to whom honour is due,<br />
							For Him I do beseech it may be brought.</p>

					<p>Thereat the brahmin offered both hot water and suitable medicine. Thereby the Master's sickness was healed, and to him the Exalted One rendered thanks.</p>
