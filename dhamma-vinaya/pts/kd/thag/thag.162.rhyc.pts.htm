					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age, when the Master had passed away, in the kingdom of Avanti,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> as a hrahmin's son, he was named Dhammapāla. As he was returning from Takkasilā, his schooldays finished, he saw on his way a certain Thera in a single cell,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and hearing from him the Norm, he believed, left the world, and acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i></p>

					<p>Now, as he was ruminating in the bliss of his achievement, two novices climbed a tree at the Vihāra to pick blossoms, and a branch breaking, they were falling. Seeing them, the Thera caught them with his hand, and by his <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> iddhi-power<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> placed them unhurt upon the ground. And he taught them, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v203"><span class="f2 c"><b>[203]</b></span></a> The brother who while young hath given himself<br />
							Wholly to carry out the Buddha's plan,<br />
							Who keepeth vigil in a sleeping world,<br />
							Not vainly, not for naught he spends his days.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v204"><span class="f2 c"><b>[204]</b></span></a> So let the wise man, so let him who aye<br />
							Remembereth that which Buddhas have enjoined,<br />
							Devote himself to faith and righteousness,<br />
							To know the blessedness They brought to us,<br />
							And the true vision of the holy Norm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
