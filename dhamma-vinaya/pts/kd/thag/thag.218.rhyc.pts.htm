					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> as the son of the King of Kosala's chaplain, he was named Jenta. When grown up he became intoxicated with his advantages of birth, wealth, and position, despising where he should have honoured, and stiff with pride. One day he approached the Master, who was teaching in the midst of a great company, and be thought: 'If the Samana Gotama  will first address me, I will also speak; I will not voluntarily address him.' Thus the Exalted One not addressing him, and he through pride not speaking either, he showed the motive for his coming as he stood there. Him the Exalted One then addressed in a verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">To dwell on proud, vain fancies is not well.<br />
							Cultivate, brahmin, that which profiteth.<br />
							The good which thou dost seek in coming here -<br />
							That, and that only shouldst thou dwell upon.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> Jenta thinking, 'He knows my thoughts!' was greatly drawn to him, and fell at his feet, paying the highest degree of homage. And he asked the Master, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">For whom is one to cultivate no pride?<br />
							Whom should one honour? Whom should one revere?<br />
							To whom if one show reverence is it well?</p>

					<p class="f4">To him the Exalted One:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">For mother and for father too, likewise<br />
							For eldest brother, for the teacher, for<br />
							The brahmin and for them of yellow robe:<br />
							For these is one to cultivate no pride,<br />
							These should one honour, these should one revere,<br />
							To these if one show reverence it is well.<br />
							The arahants cool, adept, sane, immune,<br />
							For whom pride perished as they crossed the goal,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							To them beyond all others homage pay.</p>

					<p class="f4">Jenta by that teaching became a Stream-winner, entered the Order, and in due course won arahantship. Thereupon in celebrating his achievement he thus declared <i>aññā:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v423"><span class="f2 c"><b>[423]</b></span></a> Infatuated with my birth, my wealth<br />
							And influence, with the beauty of my form<br />
							Intoxicated, thus I led my life.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v424"><span class="f2 c"><b>[424]</b></span></a> O'ermuch I fancied none was like to me.<br />
							A poor young fool by overweening spoilt,<br />
							Stubborn with pride, posing and insolent.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v425"><span class="f2 c"><b>[425]</b></span></a> Mother and father, ay, and others too<br />
							Claiming respect and honour, never one<br />
							Did I salute, discourteous, stiff with pride.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg220"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></a> <a id="v426"><span class="f2 c"><b>[426]</b></span></a> Then saw I Him the Guide, Leader Supreme,<br />
							The peerless Chief 'mong drivers of mankind,<br />
							In glory shining like the sun, with all<br />
							The company of brethren in his train.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v427"><span class="f2 c"><b>[427]</b></span></a> Casting away conceit and wanton pride,<br />
							A pious gladness filling all my heart,<br />
							Lowly I rendered homage with the head<br />
							To Him among all creatures Best and Chief.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v428"><span class="f2 c"><b>[428]</b></span></a> Well extirpated now and put away<br />
							Is both o'erweening and hypocrisy;<br />
							The what and that 'I am' is snapt in twain,<br />
							Yea, every form of self-conceit is slain.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>
