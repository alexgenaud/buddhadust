					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Vesālī, in a brahmin's family, he was named Kaṇhamitta. Come of age, he saw the majesty of the Buddha when the latter came to Vesālī, <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> and believing, he took orders under Mahā-Kaccana. Dull of insight, and beginning to make effort, he was so long dependent upon the wisdom of his co-religionists that they called him Valliya (Creeperling), saying, 'Like ivy and such plants, that cannot grow leaning on nothing, so he cannot get on without leaning on someone who is wise.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And it came to pass that he went to hear Thera Veṇudatta preach, and becoming thereby heedful and intelligent and ripe in knowledge, he asked that proficient teacher, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v167"><span class="f2 c"><b>[167]</b></span></a> All that by earnest work has to be done,<br />
							All that one fain to wake to truth must do.<br />
							All that shall be my work nor shall I fail.<br />
							O see my forward strides in energy!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v168"><span class="f2 c"><b>[168]</b></span></a> And do thou show me how and where to go -<br />
							The Path that's founded on Ambrosia -<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> So I in silent study pondering<br />
							Shall to the silence of the seers attain,<br />
							As glides great Gangā's river to the main.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Then Veṇudatta gave him an exercise for study, and he, working at it, not long after won arahantship. Declaring aññā, he uttered those same verses.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Apparently a different Thera from the Valliyas of <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p53">LIII.</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p123">CXXIII.,</a> in whose case Valliya would seem to be no nickname. I have called <i>valli</i> (creeper) 'ivy,' because of its typically representing for us such a character. On Mahā-Kaccana, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p229">CCXXIX.</a> Veṇudatta is not met with elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Nibbāne paṭiṭṭhitattā (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The quarter verse <i>ahaṃ monena monissaṃ</i> has been perhaps unduly expanded, but it was to do justice to the association, for classic Indian literature, between the seer or sage <i>(muni)</i> and silence (<i>cf.</i> <i>Chāndogya Upanishad,</i> viii. 5, 2). The simile of the Ganges illustrates both silent progress and attainment. Nevertheless, the Commentary will have nothing to do with silence; for it, <i>monena</i> is 'by wisdom or insight,' and <i>monissaṃ</i> is 'I shall know or discern (Nibbāna).'</p>
