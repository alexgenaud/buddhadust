					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Magadha, as the son of a district rāja, he was named Visākha. But because he was the son of the daughter of the king of the Pañcālas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he became known afterwards as the Pañcālī's son.</p>

					<p>At his father's death he succeeded to his title, but when the Master came to his neighbourhood he went to hear him, and believed, and left the world. Following him to Sāvatthī, he established insight, and acquired sixfold abhiññā.</p>

					<p>Thereupon, in kindness to his own folk, he visited his native place. And as people kept coming to hear him, he was one day asked: 'How many qualities, your reverence, should a man acquire to be a preacher of the Norm?' The <a id="pg153"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></a> Thera taught them the essential feature of such an one as follows:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v209"><span class="f2 c"><b>[209]</b></span></a> Let him not be puffed up, nor other folk<br />
							Belittle, nor despise nor yet molest<br />
							The victor who hath overcome the world.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Nor let him drag the praises of himself<br />
							Before the public; let him be<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> sober, meek,<br />
							And moderate in speech and virtuous.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v210"><span class="f2 c"><b>[210]</b></span></a> Is there a man who can the truth discern,<br />
							Tho' it be very subtle and refined?<br />
							Who skilled to measure spiritual growth,<br />
							Is yet of lowly, and of gentle mind.<br />
							Who shapes his life by rule of Them that Wake:<br />
							For him, Nibbāna is not hard to find.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
