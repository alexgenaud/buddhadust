					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, in the family of a Sākiyan raja, he was named Meghiya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> When grown up, he entered the Order and ministered to the Exalted One while he was residing at Calika on the River Kimikālā. And seeing a pleasant mango-wood he desired to dwell there. Twice the Exalted One refused, but at his third request, let him go. There, however, being consumed by evil thoughts as by flies, he got no concentration of mind, so he returned and told the Master. The latter said, 'When the heart, Meghiya, is not ripe for emancipation, five things conduce thereto,' and admonished him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> Whereupon Meghiya attained arahantship, and announced his aññā in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v66"><span class="f2 c"><b>[66]</b></span></a> He, the great Hero, counselled me, whose mind<br />
							Hath all transcended that our minds may know.<br />
							And I, hearing the Norm, held close to Him<br />
							In loving pupillage and piety.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The threefold wisdom have I made my own,<br />
							And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Meaning 'cloudy,' 'cloud-like,' a name of happier augury in India than in more humid climates. Told more fully in <i>Udāna,</i> IV., i.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> More literally, 'dwelt near him having loved, or being devoted to.' But the idiom, to leave the world dwelling 'near' a Teacher implies the relation of pupillage.</p>

A Dhamma friend; 2. mastering ethical conduct; 3. talk on wanting little, contentment, solitude, effort, ethical conduct, serenity, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and freedom; 4. living whole-heartedly single-mindedly intent on attainment of awakening; 5. penetrating knowledge of the orgin and passing away of phenomena and the 8-fold Way.</p>
