					<p>Now he was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthi, as the son of a councillor, and was named Ātuma. When he was adolescent his mother proposed to find him a wife, and consulted with kinsfolk. But he, being impelled by the fullness of conditions, said: 'What have I to do with house-ways? Now will I leave the world.' But though he went <a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> to the Brethren and was ordained, yet did his mother seek to corrupt his pious wish. Then he declared his inclination in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v72"><span class="f2 c"><b>[72]</b></span></a> As the new bamboo-stem, even when grown<br />
							To its full knotted height, can scarce emerge,<br />
							So I by all this bringing home of brides -<br />
							Give me your leave! Gone forth e'en now am I.</p>

					<p>And even as he stood speaking to his mother, insight grew in him, and casting off the defilements,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he became an arahant.</p>
