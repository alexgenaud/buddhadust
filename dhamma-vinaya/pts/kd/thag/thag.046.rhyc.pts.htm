					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha,</a>, in a clansman's family.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> From the time he was born the wealth of his family increased, and he himself, handsome and virtuous, became known as Samiddhi (Prospero). He saw the power of the Buddha when the latter was met by Bimbisāra,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> won faith in him, and left the world, abiding devoted to meditation. When the Exalted One was staying at the Tapoda Park,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Samiddhi one day was musing in exquisite joy on his good fortune as a bhikkhu. Then Māra the Evil One, unable to bear it, made a fearful noise near him, as if the very earth were splitting. The Thera told this to the Exalted One. The latter bade him persist where he was and think no more about it. He obeyed, and soon after won arahantship. Māra, unaware of it, once more created a fearful noise. But the Thera felt no fear: 'Undaunted by all such Māras, not once have I turned a hair!' And confessing <i>aññā,</i> he uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v46"><span class="f2 c"><b>[46]</b></span></a> In trust and hope forth from my home I came<br />
							Into the homeless life. And there in me<br />
							Have mindfulness and insight grown, and tense<br />
							And well composed my heart and mind. Make thou<br />
							Whatever shams thou list, thou'lt harm me not.</p>

					<p>And Mara, thus rebuked, said, 'The recluse knows me,' and vanished from that place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This episode is related in nearly the same words, and with the same gāthā, in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_04_marasamyutta.htm"><i>Māra-Saṃyutta</i></a> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.001-025.rhyc.pts.htm#sn.1.4.22">(<i>Saṇy.,</i> i. 119 f., p. 91),</a> but the geography is a little halting. In the Nikāya the locality is Silāvatī of the Sākiyans; the Tapoda Park was on the river of that name at Rājagaha. Samiddhi, in the double rôle of Adonis and Galahad, is the subject of the 'Samiddhi-jātaka' <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.2/jat.2.167.rous.pts.htm">(Jātaka ii., No. 167).</a></p>
