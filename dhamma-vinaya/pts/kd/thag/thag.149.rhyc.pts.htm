					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha in a brahmin's family, he came to be designated by his gens-name of Bhāradvāja.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Living the domestic life, a son was born to him, and he named him Kaṇhadinna. When the boy was of proper age, his father said, 'Come, dear boy, and study under such and such a teacher,' and sent him to Takkasilā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> On his way thither he made friends with a great Thera, a disciple of the Master, heard him teach the Norm, took orders, and after due training won arahantship.</p>

					<p>Now his father Bhāradvāja heard the Exalted One teach the Norm at the Bamboo Grove Vihāra, and he, too, left the world and realized arahantship. But Kaṇhadinna came to salute the Master at Rājagaha, and with joy he saw his father seated near the latter. And he asked himself: 'My father, too, has gone forth. Has he, I <a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> wonder, attained the end of the religious life?' Then he discerned that his father was an arahant, and wishing to make him utter a lion-roar, asked him: 'Hast thou succeeded in attaining the end of that for which we leave the world?' Then Bhāradvāja showed his attainment in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v177"><span class="f2 c"><b>[177]</b></span></a> 'Tis thus th' enlightened lift their triumph-song,<br />
							Like lions roaring in the hill-ravine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Heroes who in the holy war have won,<br />
							And conquered evil, Māra and his host.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v178"><span class="f2 c"><b>[178]</b></span></a> The servant of the blessed Master I,<br />
							A votary of the Norm and Brotherhood;<br />
							And glad and gratified my heart to see<br />
							My son purged of the poisons, sane, immune.</p>
