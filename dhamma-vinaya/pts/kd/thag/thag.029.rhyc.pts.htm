					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, as the son of a wealthy brahmin,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> his parents wedded him to a brahmin's daughter suitable in birth, beauty and every other respect. And he, enjoying his lot with her, was one day, while he contemplated the perfection of her beauty, admonished by <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> the order of things,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> that such beauty must needs ere long be crushed out by decay and death. Nay, when but a few days had passed by, his wife was bitten by a black snake and died. Overwhelmed by anguish he sought the Master and, hearing the Norm, severed his domestic ties and left the world. Now while he was training himself ethically, he could not make straight his heart.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> And going for alms into the village,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> he saw a fletcher applying his tools and making straight the shaft of an arrow. Then, he thought: 'These men make even a senseless thing straight; why do I not make straight my heart?' So he turned back and, seated for siesta, stirred up insight. And lo! the Exalted One, seated in the air above him, admonished him by this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v29"><span class="f2 c"><b>[29]</b></span></a> Now bend aloft thyself; e'en as his bolt<br />
							The fletcher, so do thou, O Hārita,<br />
							Make straight thy heart and ignorance cut away.</p>

					<p>Hearing him, the Thera developed insight, and soon became an arahant. He thereupon confessed <i>aññā</i> with this same verse.</p>
