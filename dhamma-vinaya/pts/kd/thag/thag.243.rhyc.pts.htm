					<p>He got rebirth, in the lifetime of our Exalted One, at the city of Campā, in the family of a distinguished councillor. From the time when his birth was expected, his father's great wealth increased even more, and on his birthday the whole town kept festival. Now because of his generosity in a previous birth to a Silent Buddha, his body was as fine gold and most delicately soft, wherefore he was named Soṇa (golden). On the soles of his feet and the palms of bis hand grew fine down of golden colour, and he was reared in luxury, in three mansions suited to each of the three seasons.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Now when our Master had attained omniscience and begun rolling the wheel of the Norm, and was staying at Rājagaha, King Bimbisara sent for Soṇa. He, having arrived with a great company of fellow-townsmen, heard the Master teach the Norm, and, winning faith, obtained his parents' consent to enter the Order. He received a subject of study from the Master, but was unable to concentrate, owing to his maintaining intercourse with people while he stayed in Cool Wood. And he thought: 'My body is too delicately reared to arrive happily at happiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> A <a id="pg276"><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></a> recluse's duties involve bodily fatigues.' So he disregarded the painful sores on his feet got from pacing up and down, and strove his utmost, but was unable to win. And he thought: 'I am not able to create<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> either path or fruit. Of what use is the religious life to me? I will go back to lower things and work merit.' Then the Master discerned, and saved him by the lesson on the Parable of the Lute,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> showing him how to temper energy with calm. Thus corrected, he went to Vulture's Peak, and in due course won arahantship. Reflecting on his achievement, he thus declared his <i>aññā:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v632"><span class="f2 c"><b>[632]</b></span></a> Who once in Anga's realm was passing rich,<br />
							A squire to Anga's king,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> lo! he to-day<br />
							Is of fair wealth in spiritual things.<br />
							Yea, past all ill hath Soṇa won his way.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v633"><span class="f2 c"><b>[633]</b></span></a> Five cut thou off; Five leave behind, and Five beyond these cultivate!<br />
							He who the Fivefold Bond transcends - a Brother Flood-crossed is he called.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v634"><span class="f2 c"><b>[634]</b></span></a> Seest thou a Brother with a rush-like mind,<br />
							[Stuck-up and empty],<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> trifler, keen to taste<br />
							External things? Never will he attain<br />

							In mental training, or in insight's grasp.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v636"><span class="f2 c"><b>[636]</b></span></a> In whom the constant governance of sense<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v637"><span class="f2 c"><b>[637]</b></span></a> In the straight Path, the Path that is declared,<br />

							That so to highest Good I might attain.<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v640"><span class="f2 c"><b>[640]</b></span></a> He who hath compassed yielding up the world.<br />

 							And trembleth never in the windy blast,<br />
 							So all the world of sights and tastes and sounds,<br />
 							Odours and tangibles, yea, things desired,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v644"><span class="f2 c"><b>[644]</b></span></a> And undesirable can ne'er excite<br />
 							A man like him. His mind stands firm, detached.<br />
 							And of all that<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> he notes the passing hence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Unnaḷo</i> is thua derived by Buddhists. <i>Cf. s.v.</i> Childers' Dictionary.
