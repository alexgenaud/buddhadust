					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age as one of a family of flower-scavengers,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he earned his living as a road-sweeper, not making enough to still his hunger. Now in the first watch of the night the Exalted One, attaining that mood of great pity so largely practised by Buddhus, surveyed the world. And he marked the conditions of arahantship in the heart of Sunīta, shining like a lamp within a jar. And when the night paled into dawn he rose and dressed, and with bowl and robe, followed by his bhikkhu train, walked to Rājagaha for alms, and sought the street where Sunīta was cleaning. Now Sunīta was collecting scraps, rubbish, and so on into heaps, and filling therewith the baskets he carried on a yoke. And when he saw the Master and his train approaching, his heart was filled with joy and awe. Finding no place to hide in on the road, he placed his yoke <a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> in a bend of the wall, and stood as if stuck to the wall saluting with clasped hands. Then the Master, when he had come near, spoke to him in voice divinely sweet, saying: 'Sunīta! what to you is that wretched mode of living? Can you endure to leave the world?' And Sunīta, experiencing the rapture of one who has been sprinkled by ambrosia, said: 'If even such as I, Exalted One, may in this life take orders, why should I not? May the Exalted One suffer me to come forth.' Then the Master said: 'Come, bhikkhu!' And he, by that word receiving sanction and ordination, was by magic power invested with bowl and robes. The Master, leading him to the Vihāra, taught him an exercise, and he won first the eight attainments<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and fivefold abhinna; then developing insight, the sixth. And Sakka and the Brahmā gods came and did homage to him, as it is written:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Those deities seven hundred, glorious,<br />
							Brahmas and Indra's following drew nigh<br />
							And gladly paid Sunīta homage due,<br />
							As high-bred victor over age and death.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Exalted One saw him surrounded by gods, and smiled and commended him, teaching the Norm by the verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'By discipline of holy life! ...<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now many bhikkhus, desirous of raising their 'lion's roar,' asked Sunīta: 'From what family did you come forth? Or why did you leave the world? And how did <a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> you penetrate the truths?' Then Sunlta told them the whole matter thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v620"><span class="f2 c"><b>[620]</b></span></a> Humble the clan wherein I took my birth,<br />
							And poor was I and scanty was my lot;<br />
							Mean task was mine, a scavenger of flowers.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v621"><span class="f2 c"><b>[621]</b></span></a> One for whom no man cared, despised, abused,<br />
							My mind I humbled and I bent the head<br />
							In deference to a goodly tale of folk.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v622"><span class="f2 c"><b>[622]</b></span></a> And then I saw the All-Eulightened come,<br />
							Begirt and followed by his bhikkhu-train,<br />
							Great Champion ent'ring Magadha's chief town.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v623"><span class="f2 c"><b>[623]</b></span></a> I laid aside my baskets and my yoke,<br />
							And came where I might due obeisance make,<br />
							And of his lovingkindness just for me,<br />
							The Chief of men halted upon his way.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v624"><span class="f2 c"><b>[624]</b></span></a> Low at his feet I bent, then standing by,<br />
							I begged the Master's leave to join the Rule<br />
							And follow him, of every creature Chief.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v625"><span class="f2 c"><b>[625]</b></span></a> Then he whose tender mercy watcheth all<br />
							The world, the Master pitiful and kind,<br />
							Gave me my answer: Come, bhikkhu! he said.<br />
							Thereby to me was ordination given.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v626"><span class="f2 c"><b>[626]</b></span></a> Lo! I alone in forest depths abode,<br />
							With zeal unfaltering wrought the Master's word,<br />
							Even the counsels of the Conqueror.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v627"><span class="f2 c"><b>[627]</b></span></a> While passed the first watch of the night there rose<br />
							Long memories of the bygone line of lives.<br />
							While passed the middle watch, the heav'nly eye,<br />
							Purview celestial, was clarified.<br />
							While passed the last watch of the night, I burst<br />
							Asunder all the gloom of ignorance.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> <a id="v628"><span class="f2 c"><b>[628]</b></span></a> Then as the night wore down at dawn<br />
							And rose the sun, came Indra and Brahmā,<br />
							Yielding me homage with their clasped hands:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v629"><span class="f2 c"><b>[629]</b></span></a> Hail unto thee, thou nobly born of men!<br />
							Hail unto thee, thou highest among men!<br />
							Perished for thee are all th' intoxicants;<br />
							And thou art worthy, noble sir, of gifts.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v630"><span class="f2 c"><b>[630]</b></span></a> The Master, seeing me by troop of gods<br />
							Begirt and followed, thereupon a smile<br />
							Revealing, by this utterance made response:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v631"><span class="f2 c"><b>[631]</b></span></a> 'By discipline of holy life, restraint<br />
							And mastery of self: hereby a man<br />
							Is holy; this is holiness supreme!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
