					<p>This Thera's verse has already been recorded in the first Canto,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> where is incorporated the admonition to his sisters' sons to be mindful. Here are incorporated the verses he published during his life in the Order. This is the point of them: When he had won arahantship, he went from time to time with the great Theras, Sāriputta and the rest, to visit the Master, and after staying for a while, returned to the Acacia Wood, dwelling in the bliss of fruition won and in the Sublime Moods.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> And thus he continued till he was an aged man. Going thus one day to visit the Buddha, he stayed not far from Sāvatthī in a forest. Now the police came round on the track of thieves. The thieves running by the Thera dropped their booty near him and ran. And the police, running up, arrested the Thera, dragged him before the king, and said: 'This, Sire, is the thief!' The king<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> had him released, and asked him: 'Has your reverence committed this robbery or not?' Then the Thera, who had never from his birth done anything of the sort, taught the Norm, by way of showing his incapacity for such an act, in these verses:</p>

							Ne'er have I harboured conscious wish or plan<br />
							Un-Ariyan or linked with enmity.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v646"><span class="f2 c"><b>[646]</b></span></a> Ne'er mine the quest, all this long interval; -<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v647"><span class="f2 c"><b>[647]</b></span></a> Nay, love I do avow, made infinite,<br />
							Well trained, by orderly progression grown,<br />
							Even as by the Buddha it is taught.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v648"><span class="f2 c"><b>[648]</b></span></a> With all am I a friend, comrade to all,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v649"><span class="f2 c"><b>[649]</b></span></a> A heart that cannot drift or fluctuate<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p42">XLII.</a> Revata is a brother of Sāriputta, and hence a brother of Upasena (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p238">CCXXXVIII.</a>) and of Cunda (CXXXI.). The summary reference is in Dhammapāla's own words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See	verse 286, <i>n.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Pasenadi, King of Kosala, was a warm lay-adherent, and was alive in the Buddha's last years (<i>Majjh.,</i> ii. 124). <i>Cf.</i> the similar episode, with a very different judge, on p. 109.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p48">XLVIII.;</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p240">CCXL.,</a> verse 603.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> - verses 999 <i>ff.</i> in his brother's poem.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Namely, in the second stage of <i>Jhāna</i> (Commentary). The Commentary cites <i>Majjh. Nik.,</i> i. 161. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Saɱy. Nik.,</i> ii. 273.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p146">CXLVI.</a> and preceding Ps., verse 643.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> verses 231, 403, and <i>Sisters,</i> verse 5, and <i>note</i>. Here the Commenitary pertinently adds being born in the 'Middle Country' (p. 107) to the great 'conjuncture.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> = verses 606, 607, 604, 605.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Cf.</i> the Buddha's last words (<i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 173), and Sāriputta's, below, verse 1017.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The Chronicle relates that he then and there passed away — lit., 'became extinct' — like a flame going out. There is no 'passing hence' in the Pali term <i>parinibisṃ,</i> as originally conceived.</p>
