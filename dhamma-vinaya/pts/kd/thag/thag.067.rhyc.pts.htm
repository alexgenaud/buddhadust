					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Setavyā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in the family of a councillor. When the Exalted One visited Setavyā, and stayed in the Singsapa Wood, he went to listen <a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> to him, saluting, and sitting down at one side. The Master contemplated his inclinations, and taught him the Norm in the verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Impermanent indeed are all component things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And he, influenced by his past resolve (to leave the world when the Norm was revived), discerned the truth more plainly, left the world, and studying the notions of ill and of the absence of soul, acquired insight and won arahantship. And because, by one hearing of the Norm alone, his destiny was fulfilled, he acquired the name of Once-Norm-hearer <i>(Ekadhammasavanīya)</i>. His <i>aññā</i> he confessed in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v67"><span class="f2 c"><b>[67]</b></span></a> Burnt up in me is all that doth defile,<br />
							And rooted out all life's continuance;<br />
							Slain utterly the cycle of re-birth:<br />
							Now is there no more coming back to be.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This phrase and that of 'life's continuance' are in the Pali both <i>bhava,</i> first plural, then singular with prefix of <i>puna,</i> 'again'; lit., 'becomings' and 'becoming-again.' By the plural form the three chief modes of rebirth are understood - <i>kāma-</i>, <i>rūpa</i> and <i>arūpa-bhava</i> - as well as both <i>kammabhava,</i> or that continuity of action or character which determines future <i>bhava,</i> and the <i>uppatti-bhava,</i> or resultant rebirth itself (so the Commentary). This doctrine is explained in the <i>Compendium of Philosophy,</i> especially pp. 262-264.</p>
