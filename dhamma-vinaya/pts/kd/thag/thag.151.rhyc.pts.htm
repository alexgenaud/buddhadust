					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the family of a brahmin of Kosala, he was named Migasira<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> after the constellation under which he obtained birth. And having acquired brahmin culture, he practised the skull-spell,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> so that, when he had muttered the spell and tapped with his nail on the skull, he would declare, 'This person is reborn in such a sphere,' even with respect to those who had been dead three years. Disliking domestic life, he became a Wanderer,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and through his art won favour and respect. Coming to Sāvatthī and going before the Master, he declared his power, saying: 'I, master Gotama, can tell the destiny of dead persons.' 'How do you tell it?' He let a skull be brought, and, muttering his rune and tapping with his nail, he asserted purgatory or some other sphere to be the place of rebirth.</p>

					<p>Then the Exalted One had the skull of a bhikkhu brought, who had attained complete outgoing <i>(parinibbāna)</i>, and said: 'Tell now his destiny to whom this skull belonged!' Migasira muttered and tapped, but saw neither the beginning nor the end. Then the Master said: 'Art not able, Wanderer?' He replied, 'I must first make sure,' and turning the skull round never so much - for how should he know the goings of an arahant?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> - stood ashamed, <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> perspiring, dumb. 'Art tired, Wanderer?' 'Ay, I am tired; I cannot discern the destiny of this one. Do you make it known?'	'I know it, and more besides. He is gone to Nibbāna.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Then said the Wanderer: 'Give me this hidden lore!' 'Then do you take orders.' So Migasira was ordained, and was given exercises in calm. Well grounded in <i>jhāna</i> and <i>abhiññā,</i> he practised insight, and not long after won arahantship. He then confessed <i>aññā</i> thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v181"><span class="f2 c"><b>[181]</b></span></a> Since I went forth and entered on the Rule<br />
							Ordained by the Enlightened One Supreme,<br />
							Emancipated as I went, I rose<br />
							Transcending all these things of sense-desire.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v182"><span class="f2 c"><b>[182]</b></span></a> While He, that Very Brahmin,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> looked on me,<br />
							O then my heart was set at liberty!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Yea, since all bonds are broke for evermore,<br />
							For me Emancipation's fixed and sure!</p>
