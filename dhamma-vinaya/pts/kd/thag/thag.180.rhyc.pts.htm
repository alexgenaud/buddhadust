					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a barber's family, he was named Upāli. Come of age he left the world, following Anuruddha and the other five nobles, when the Exalted One was staying at Anupiyā Grove, as is recorded in the Pali.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Now when he was taking a subject for exercise from the Master, he said: 'Send me not away, Lord, to dwell in the forest.' 'Bhikkhu, you dwelling in the forest, will develop one subject<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> only; if you dwell with us, you will become proficient in both book-knowledge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and insight.' The Thera, consenting to the Master's word, practised for insight, and in due time won arahantship.</p>

					<p><a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> Moreover, the Master himself taught him the whole <i>Vinaya-Piṭaka</i>. And later, after Upāli had won the Master's commendation of his decision in the three cases of Ajjuka, the Kurukacchaka bhikkhu and Kumāra-Kassapa, he was ranked first among those who knew the Vinaya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>One feast-day, when he was reciting the Pātimokkha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> he thus admonished the brethren:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v249"><span class="f2 c"><b>[249]</b></span></a> He who for faith's sake<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> hath renounced the world,<br />
							And stands a novice in the Order new,<br />
							Friends let him choose of noble character,<br />
							Pure in their lives, of zeal unfaltering.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v250"><span class="f2 c"><b>[250]</b></span></a> He who for faith's sake hath renounced the world,<br />
							And stands a novice in the Order new,<br />
							Among the Order let that bhikkhu dwell,<br />
							And wisely<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> learn its code of discipline.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v251"><span class="f2 c"><b>[251]</b></span></a> He who for faith's sake hath renounced the world,<br />
							And stands a novice in the Order new,<br />
							Skilled in what should be done, or left undone,<br />
							Let him uncompanied hold on his way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> See <i>Vinaya,</i> iii. 66; 39, and above <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p161">CLXI.</a> respectively.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This-the 'Rules of Disburdenment' - constituted, and still constitutes, a fortnightly ritual (<i>Vinaya Texts</i>. i. 1-69).</p>

Upāli's own beginning was not so single-minded, he having joined precisely in order to protect his life. The young nobles gave him their effects to take home, and he, fearing that the Sākiyans might suspect him of murder, hung up the bundle on a tree and followed them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Budho.</i> The Commentary interprets: <i>buddhā ti ca pathan ti; so ev'attho.</i> The iteration 'novice ... new' is in the text.</p>
