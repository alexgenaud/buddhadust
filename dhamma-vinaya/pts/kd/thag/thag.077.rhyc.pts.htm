					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthi, in the family of an elephant-driver, as he grew up, he became proficient in managing elephants. One day, as he was training an elephant by the river, he was impelled by maturing conditions to think: 'What is all this elephant-taming to me? Better is it to tame one's self.' So he went to the Exalted One, heard the Norm, believed, entered the Order, and exercised himself in insight on a basis of ethical meditation. And as a skilful elephant-trainer restrains savage ways by his hook, so he by meditation suffered not his thoughts to wander away from his exercise, saying this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v77"><span class="f2 c"><b>[77]</b></span></a> Once roamed this heart a field, a wanderer<br />
							Wherever will, or whim, or pleasure led.<br />
							To-day that heart I'll hold in thorough check,<br />
							As trainer's hook the savage elephant.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And so acting, his insight expanded, and he realized arahantship.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This goes to form one verse in the interesting poem ascribed to Tālapuṭa <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.262.rhyc.pts.htm#v1130">(CCLXII, 1130).</a> 'Trainer's hook,' more accurately 'grasper of the hook.'</p>
