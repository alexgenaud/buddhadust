					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a clan of Magadha brahmins, as the brother of Uruveḷa-Kassapa, hie religious inclination made him dislike domestic life, and he became an <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> ascetic. With 300 ascetics he carried on a hermit's life on the banks of the River Nerañjarā, and thus he became known, by his habit and the name of his gens, as Kassapa of the River. Now how the Exalted One ordained him and his company by the summons, 'Come, bhikkhu,' is recorded in the Khandaka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> He was confirmed in arahantship by the Exalted One's sermon on Burning. Thereafter reflecting on his achievement, he confessed <i>aññā</i> by way of extolling his rooting out of error:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v340"><span class="f2 c"><b>[340]</b></span></a> 0 truly for my good it was that He,<br />
							The Buddha came to the Nerañjarā,<br />
							Whose doctrine hearing, I renounced wrong views.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v341"><span class="f2 c"><b>[341]</b></span></a> The celebrant in many a sacrifice,<br />
							I fostered sacred fire, oblations made;<br />
							'These be the pure and holy rites!' methought -<br />
							0 blind and average worldling that I was!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v342"><span class="f2 c"><b>[342]</b></span></a> Errant in wilderness of heresies,<br />
							By their contagion dazed and led astray,<br />
							I deemed that pure religion which was false.<br />
							And blinded was I, shiftless, ignorant.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v343"><span class="f2 c"><b>[343]</b></span></a> Now is all error put away for me;<br />
							Broken the line of comings back to be.<br />
							Worth every gift, the Fire I celebrate:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							I worship 'Him who on This Wise hath Come.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v344"><span class="f2 c"><b>[344]</b></span></a> Illusions all have I put far away.<br />
							Crushed is the thirst for going on to be,<br />
							And shattered is the endless round of life.<br />
							Now cometh nevermore rebirth for me!</p>
