					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at the village of Nālaka as the son of Rūpasārī, the brahminee, he was named Upasena.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg262"><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></a> Having come of age and learnt the three Vedas, he renounced the world after hearing the Master teach the Norm. Ordained but one year, he thought, 'I will multiply the breed of the Ariyas,' and himself ordained another bhikkhu, and with him went to wait upon the Master. The latter, having heard of this, rebuked his hasty procedure. Then Upasena thought: 'If now, on account of having a following, I am blamed by the Master, on that same account will I earn his praise.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> And studying for insight, he won in due course arahantship. Thereafter, himself adopting the austerer practices,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> he persuaded others to do likewise, and with such success that the Exalted One ranked him foremost among those who were generally popular.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>At another time he was asked by that other bhikkhu, when at Kosambī, what was to be done during the dissensions and the schism there?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Upasena taught him thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v577"><span class="f2 c"><b>[577]</b></span></a> Lonely the spot and far away where noise<br />
							Scarce comes, the haunt of creatures of the wild:<br />
							'T is there the Brother should his couch prepare<br />
							For purposes of studious retreat.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v578"><span class="f2 c"><b>[578]</b></span></a> From rubbish-pile, or from the charnel-field,<br />
							Or from the highways let him take and bring<br />
							Worn cloths and thence a cloak of patchwork make,<br />
							And in such rough apparel clothe himself.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v579"><span class="f2 c"><b>[579]</b></span></a> In lowliness of mind from house to house,<br />
							In turn unbroken<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> let the Brother fare<br />
							<a id="pg263"><span class="f2 g"><b>[263]</b></span></a> Seeking his alms, sense guarded, well controlled;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v580"><span class="f2 c"><b>[580]</b></span></a> With any fare content rough though it be,<br />
							Nor fain for other than he gets, or more,<br />
							For if he once indulge in greed for tastes,<br />
							Ne'er can his mind in jhāna take delight.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v581"><span class="f2 c"><b>[581]</b></span></a> In great content, with very sparse desires,<br />
							Remote, secluded: so the sage should live,<br />
							Detached from housefolk and the homeless, both.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v582"><span class="f2 c"><b>[582]</b></span></a> Let him so show himself as he were dull<br />
							And dumb, nor let the wise man speech prolong<br />
							Unduly, when in midst of gathered folk.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v583"><span class="f2 c"><b>[583]</b></span></a> Let him not any man upbraid; let him<br />
							Refrain from hurting; let him be in rule<br />
							And precept trained, and temperate in food.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v584"><span class="f2 c"><b>[584]</b></span></a> Let him be one who concentrates upon<br />
							The symbol, skilled in genesis of thought.<br />
							To practise Calm let him devote himself,<br />
							And Intuition also in due time.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v585"><span class="f2 c"><b>[585]</b></span></a> With energy and perseverance armed,<br />
							Let him be ever to his studies yoked;<br />
							Nor till he have attained the end of I11,<br />
							Let the wise man go forth in confidence.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v586"><span class="f2 c"><b>[586]</b></span></a> Thus if the Brother, fain for purity<br />
							[Of knowledge and of vision]<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> shall abide,<br />
							The working of th' Intoxicants shall cease,<br />
							And he shall reach and find Nibbāna's peace.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Now the Thera, in so admonishing that bhikkhu, showed his own attainment, and confessed <i>aññā.</i></p>
