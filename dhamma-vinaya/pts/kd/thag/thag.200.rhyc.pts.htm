					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha as the son of King Bimbisara's chaplain, he was named Girimānanda. He saw the power and majesty of a Buddha when the Master attended the meeting at Rājagaha, and he entered the Order. During his studies he stayed awhile at a village, then came back to the town to salute the Master. And Bimbisāra the maharāja heard of his coming, and going to him, said: 'Do you dwell here, your reverence; I will supply your needs.' But from his much business he forgot, so that the Thera dwelt in the open. And the weather-gods held off the rain for fear of wetting the Thera. Then the king, noting the drought, built him a hermitage. And the Thera, sheltered in his hut, put forth all his efforts, and combining energy and calm, conjured up insight and won arahantship. Then, delighted at its advent, he confessed <i>aññā</i> while the rain fell from above:</p>
