					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the country of the Sunāparantas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in the family of a councillor, he was named Isidinna. Grown up, he saw the double miracle at the presentation of the Sandalwood Pavilion,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and coming with a satisfied mind to the Master, he heard the Norm, and became a Stream-winner. While still living a domestic life, a compassionate spirit urged him, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v187"><span class="f2 c"><b>[187]</b></span></a> I mark the pious laity who treasure on their lips the Norm;<br />
							How you may often hear them say: 'Transient are all this world's desires!'<br />
							But in their hearts lies love of pelf, of precious stones and jewelled rings,<br />
							And that which fills their thought is care of sons and daughters and of wives.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v188"><span class="f2 c"><b>[188]</b></span></a> Nay, verily, they do not know the inward meaning of the Norm;<br />
							E'en though you often hear them say: 'Transient are all this world's desires!'<br />
							To cut themselves from passions free, they lack the spiritual health,<br />
							And therefore cleaveth aye their heart to wife and children, and to wealth.</p>

					<p>When the layman heard this, he was thrilled with emotion, and leaving the world, he not long after won arahantship. In confessing <i>aññā,</i> he repeated these verses.</p>
