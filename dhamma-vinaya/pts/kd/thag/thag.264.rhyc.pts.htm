					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in a brahmin family, he was named Vaŋgīsa, and was taught the three Vedas. And he won favour as a teacher by tapping on skulls with his finger-nail, and discovering thereby where their former occupants were reborn.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> The brahmins saw in this a means of gain, and taking Vaŋgīsa, toured about in villages, townships and royal residences. And for three years Vaŋgīsa, had skulls brought to him and divined. Persuading the people to believe in him, he won fees of 100 and even 1000 (? <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/weights_and_measures/weights_and_measures.htm#kahapana"><i>kahāpaṇas</i></a>). And the brahmins took him about wherever they chose to go. Now he heard of the Master's virtues, and wished to visit him, but the brahmins objected, saying: 'Gotama the recluse will pervert you by his craftiness.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> But Vaŋgīsa heeded them not and went, seating himself at one side. The Master seeing him asked: 'Vaŋgīsa, do you know any art or craft?' 'Yes, Master Gotama, I know the skull-spell. By that, tapping <a id="pg396"><span class="f2 g"><b>[396]</b></span></a> on a skull with my finger-nail, have I, for three years past ascertained where rebirth has taken place.' The Master let him be shown the skulls of individuals reborn in purgatory, as man, as god, and of one who had passed utterly away. Divining concerning all but the last, of that he could make nothing. Then the Master: 'Art not able, Vaŋgīsa?' 'Let me make quite sure, said Vaŋgīsa, and he turned it round again and again till the sweat stood on his brow - for how will he know the going of the arahant? And he stood there silent and shamed. 'Art tired, Vaŋgīsa?' 'Ay, Master Gotama, I cannot find out where this one has been reborn. If you know, tell it.' 'Vaŋgīsa, both this I know, and I know more than this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who of every creature knoweth well<br />
							Whence they decease and where they come to be,<br />
							Enlightened, well come, freed from every tie:<br />
							- Him call I brahmin.<br />
							Whose destiny nor angel, god, nor man<br />
							Doth know, the arahant, sane and immune:<br />
							- Him call I brahmin.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then said Vaŋgīsa: 'Well then, Master Gotama, give me this hidden lore.' And doing obeisance, he seated himself as the Master's pupil. But the Master said: 'Let us give you the marks of a recluse.' Then Vaŋgīsa thought: 'I must at all costs learn this spell.' And he said to his fellow-brahmins: 'Do not think it amiss if I take orders. When I have learned this spell, I shall be first in all India, and that will bring you good fortune.' So he asked for ordination, and the Exalted One commanded Nigrodhakappa Thera, who stood near, to ordain Vaŋgīsa. The Thera did so, and then saying: 'You must first learn the accessories of the spell,' gave him the exercise of the thirty-two constituents of the body,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and one on insight. Rehearsing the former, he established the latter faculty. And when brahmins came to ask whether he had acquired <a id="pg397"><span class="f2 g"><b>[397]</b></span></a> the art, he replied: 'What art-acquiring? Go ye hence; I have no more to do with you.' The brahmins said: 'There! he too has got into the power of Gotama the recluse, perverted by craftiness. What have we to do with you as teacher?' And they went away. But Vaŋgīsa realized arahantship.</p>

					<p class="f4">As arahant, he went to the Master's presence and magnified him in scores of verses, comparing him to the moon, the sun, space, ocean, mountains, the lion, the elephant. Him the Master, seated in conclave, pronounced foremost in facility of speech.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> But what he said in verse, both before and after he became arahant, was collected and recorded by Ānanda and the other Theras at the Council as follows:</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">I.</h4>

					<p class="f4">Spoken when a novice, after having been affected by the sight of many gaily dressed women, who had approached the Vihāra, a feeling which he suppressed:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1209"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1209]</b></span></a> Alas! that now when I am gone from home<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1211"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1211]</b></span></a> But women! Well, far more than those may come,<br />

					<h4 class="ctr">II.</h4>

					<p>Spoken when suppressing his own feelings, aversion, and bo forth:</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">III</h4>

					<p>Spoken when suppressing his own behaviour in connection with his facility of speech:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1219"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1219]</b></span></a> Renounce conceit, thou, Gotama's disciple!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<h4 class="ctr">IV</h4>

					<p>One day as a novice he attended the venerable Ānanda, whom one of the King's ministers had bidden to visit him. There they were surrounded by women highly adorned, who, saluting the Thera and asking questions, heard him preach the Norm. But Vaŋgīsa was excited and moved with desire. Then he, being a well-bred man of faith and integrity, thought: 'This my emotion growing is unsuitable for my present and future good.' And seated as he was, he confessed his state to the Thera, saying:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1223"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1223]</b></span></a> My sense with passion burns, my mind's aflame.<br />
							Take thou compassion on me, Gotamid!<br />
							O tell me truly of a putting out!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And the venerable Ãnanda replied:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1224"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1224]</b></span></a> Because thy judgment is upset, perverse,<br />
							Therefore thy mind's aflame. Thou shouldst avoid<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The seeiug lovely objects passion-linked.</p>

							Let there be heedfulness concerning sense.<br />
							And be thou fiilèd with a sane distaste.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1226"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1226]</b></span></a> Study the absence of the Threefold Sign;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span><br />

							Hath the mind mastered vain imaginings,<br />
							Then mayst thou go thy ways, calm and serene.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr">V</h4>

					<p>Spoken after the Exalted One had taught tho Sutta on 'Things Well-spoken'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> in praise of the Master:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1227"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1227]</b></span></a> Whoso can speak a word whereby<br />

							On Truth and Good and Norm, 'tis said,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1230"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1230]</b></span></a> That which th'Awakened speaks, the sure<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1232"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1232]</b></span></a> He teaches first in outline brief,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> A meeting terminating the rainy season, when confession was invited. See <i>Vinaya Texts,</i> i. 825 ff. The Master (in the Suttanta, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_08_vangisa-thera-samyutta.htm#p6"><i>Saɱy. Nik.,</i> i. 189</a>) invites complaints against himself, and Sāriputta, on behalf of the others, gives him a clean bill, then receives the same himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> In our text <i>palāpo,</i> or babbler; in Burmese manuscripts of text and Commentary <i>palāso, phalāso. Pālaso,</i> having leaves, not fruit, means presumably 'sterile.' Both Commentaries, ours and the <i>Sārattha-pakāsinī,</i> explain by <i>tuccho anto, sārarahito, dussīlo</i> (empty, deprived of pith, morally bad).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Vaŋgīsa again suggests that he should be allowed to speak <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.08.001-012.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.8.8">(<i>Saɱy. Nik.,</i> i. 192).</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> The Commentary quotes only the question and answer. The rest I take from the <i>Saɱy. Nik.</i> Dhammapāla only adds that the Master wished to show Vaŋgīsa's gift to the brethren.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> One might render this clause - <i>asitaɱ va bhāgaso pavibhajja[ɱ]</i> - as Dr. Neumann does, by 'as a sickle having divided off by sections' (or sheaves), but (1) I hesitate to liken the Saviour of the Buddhists, <i>for them,</i> to a sickle; (2) both Commentaries agree that <i>asitaɱ</i> is, as in other <i>gāthās,</i> <i>e.g.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.263.rhyc.pts.htm#v1184">(1184),</a> <i>anissitaɱ</i> (independent, himself needing nothing). I have taken <i>asita</i> as meaning <i>dhāta</i> (<i>cf.</i> <i>Jātaka Commentary,</i> vol. ii.,.p. 247, text, opposed to <i>chāta,</i> lacking). The main emphasis is on the Teacher's passing on to others what he has gained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> <i>Kāveyyamattā.</i> Wrongly translated by me elsewhere. Without the Commentary I had imagined Vaŋgīsa as having been a troubadour, a <i>naṭa</i> or mime, like Tālapuṭa <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thag/thag.262.rhyc.pts.htm">(CCLXII.)</a>. Imagination and a rhetorical facility he had, but one need not substitute a new legend for the old tradition. The term occurs again in <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.001-025.pali.bd.htm#sn.1.4.13"><i>Saɱy. Nik.,</i> i. 110,</a> where the Buddha, sitting, suppressing the pain arising from a splinter in his foot, Māra inquires why he sits apart with drooping head: Is he feeling 'blithered' or worried, <i>kāveyyamatto,</i> or only sleepy? The Commentary has 'as he were thinking of what he had to say, crazy by reason of what he had to do.' Both Commentaries here have <i>kāveyyana-kabba-(ous: -kavyā-) kārakena mattā, mānitā, sambhāvitā, garukodayaɱ āpannā.</i> Vaŋgīsa's story explains the choice of the term.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> For <i>chetvā</i> read <i>chettā,</i> as Oldenberg suggests. The Commentary paraphrases by <i>chedako:</i> 'cutter-off of doubts.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> A Vihāra at the <i>chetiya</i> (pre-Buddhistic shrine), so called, at Āḷavī, a town on the Ganges, 12 yojanas from Benares, 30 from Sāvatthī.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Our Comy. reads also <i>hi</i> and <i>va.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> <i>Paroparaɱ.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sutta-Nipāta,</i> p. 59, n. 2, with p. 193, n. Our Commentary condenses the paraphrase of that Commentary: <i>[lokuttara-] lokiyavasena sundaraɱ [asundaraɱ] dūre santikaɱ vā ariya-dhamman ti.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> Lit., 'rain the heard thing' - <i>i.e.,</i> speech.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Our Commentary, unlike the text, has <i>nibbāyi so anupādiseso.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> The interpolated references to the Buddha <i>loquitur</i> are by the Compilers, says the Commentary. I do not understand <i>pañca-settho</i> here any more than did the Commentators. The allusion in the <i>Sutta-Nipāta Commentary</i> is obviously inaccurate. The Buddha was not one of the five, nor a brahmin in the social sense. Our Commentary suggests the Five Indriyas or the Five Precepts, both inapposite here. Dr. Neumann's five divisions of Middle Country and four quarters of barbarians has a more plausible sweep of world-laudation but is, I think, without precedent. Conceivably, the original reading was simply some such compound as <i>puma-settho.</i> chief of men. The metre now turns to &#347;lokas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.,</i> seventh Buddha. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="#n37">403, n. 5.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> Lit., Brahmin, but used in its original sense: holy, excellent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Consistency between word and deed is expressly named as a quality of a Tathāgata. <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/iti/iti.4.than.ati.htm#p112"><i>Iti-vuttaka,</i> § 112.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> Nigrodha-Kappa is, of course, the 'son.' 'Men' is lit. bipeds. The last verse is not in the <i>Sutta-Nipāta.</i> The term <i>devadevaɱ</i> suggests a later source.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> <i>Nāga.</i></p>
