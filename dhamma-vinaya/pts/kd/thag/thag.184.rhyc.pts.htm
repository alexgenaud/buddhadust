					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a brahmin family, he fell into the habit, from pride of birth, of calling other men low-born. Even after he had heard the Norm, and believed and entered the Order, he persisted from the <a id="pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> cumulative force of the habit. But one day, after hearing the Master preach, he reviewed his own mental procedure, and was distressed to mark the surrender to conceit and arrogance. Expelling it all, he conjured up insight and won arahantship. Thereafter, dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, he testified to <i>aññā</i> in thus admonishing the bhikkhus:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v261"><span class="f2 c"><b>[261]</b></span></a> He who is fain to-morrow to perform<br />
							The things that he should yesterday have done,<br />
							Forfeit of happy opportunity,<br />
							He shall anon repent him fierily.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v262"><span class="f2 c"><b>[262]</b></span></a> Let him but talk of that which should be done;<br />
							Let him not talk of what should not be done!<br />
							Of him who talketh much but doeth not,<br />
							Wise men take stock, and rate him at his worth.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v263"><span class="f2 c"><b>[263]</b></span></a> O great, O wondrous is Nibbāna's bliss,<br />
							Revealed by Him, the Utterly Awake!<br />
							There comes no grief, no passion, haven sure,<br />
							Where ill and ailing perish evermore!</p>
