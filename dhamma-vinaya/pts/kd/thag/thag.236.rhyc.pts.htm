					<p>His previous story is told in the Eighth Canto, in the chronicle of Roadling major. The remainder is [told in the Commentary on the Cülasetthi-Jātaka.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>]</p>

					<p>He, on another occasion, uttered these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v557"><span class="f2 c"><b>[557]</b></span></a> Sluggish and halt the progress that I made,<br />
							And therefore was I held in small esteem.<br />
							My brother judged I should be turned away,<br />
							And bade me, saying: 'Now do thou go home.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v558"><span class="f2 c"><b>[558]</b></span></a> So I, dismissed and miserable, stood<br />
							Within the gateway of the Brethren's Park,<br />
							Longing at heart within the Rule to stay.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v559"><span class="f2 c"><b>[559]</b></span></a> And there he came to me, the Exalted One,<br />
							And laid his hand upon my head; and took<br />
							My arm, and to the garden led me back.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v560"><span class="f2 c"><b>[560]</b></span></a> To me the Master in his kindness gave<br />
							A napkin for the feet and bade me thus:<br />
							'Fix thou thy mind on this clean thing, the while<br />
							Well concentrated<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> thou dost sit apart.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v561"><span class="f2 c"><b>[561]</b></span></a> And I who heard his blessed Word abode<br />
							Fain only and alway to keep his Rule,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Achieving concentrated thought and will,<br />
							That I might win the crown of all my quest.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg260"><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></a> <a id="v562"><span class="f2 c"><b>[562]</b></span></a> And now I know the where and how I lived,<br />
							And clearly shines the Eye Celestial;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,<br />
							And what the Buddha bids us do is done.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v563"><span class="f2 c"><b>[563]</b></span></a> In thousand different shapes did Panthaka<br />
							Himself by power abnormal multiply;<br />
							And seated in the pleasant Mango-Grove,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Waited until the hour should be revealed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v564"><span class="f2 c"><b>[564]</b></span></a> Then did the Master send a messenger,<br />
							Who came revealer of the hour to me,<br />
							And at th' appointed time I flew to Him.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v565"><span class="f2 c"><b>[565]</b></span></a> Low at his feet I worshipped; then aside<br />
							I sat me down; and me so seated near<br />
							Whenas he had discerned, the Master <i>then</i><br />
							Suffered that men should do him ministry.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

							Receiver of th' oblations of mankind,<br />
							Meadow of merit for the sons of men,<br />
							He did accept the gifts of piety.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.1/jat.1.043.chlm.pts.htm"><i>Jāt.,</i> i., trans. p. 114.</a> Dhammapāla also gives the story, agreeing in all but a few details, in which his version is the simpler. The gist of the 'remainder' is contained in the verses above. He also mentions the double eminence (in mind-created forms and in mental evolution), defined by Buddhaghosa as skill in the fourfold <i>Rūpa</i> and <i>Arūpa jhāna,</i> assigned to Cūḷa-Panthaka and his brother respectively (<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/01_ones/an01.188-210.wood.pts.htm#p198">Ang., i. 24</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Svadhiṭṭhitaŋ</i> is paraphrased only by <i>manasikārena.</i> Panthaka handles the cloth while he muses, till it is no longer clean and smooth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Sisters, verses 187, 194, 202.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Above, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/thag/thag.1-264.pali.bd.htm#v516">verse 516.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The property of the court physioian and lay-adherent, Jīvaka. See Sisters, p. 139 n.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The story relates that, whereas Panthaka's elder brother, who was steward, had omitted his junior from the brethren entertained at lunch by Jīvaka, the Buddha (who had left Cūḷa-Panthaka studying impurity by the towel as object-lesson) closed his bowl with his hand when food was offered till Cūḷa had been sent for. How Cūḷa's new powers of magic mystify the messenger is told in the <i>Jātaka</i> Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This rendering of <i>āyāgo,</i> following Dr. Neumann, is supported by the Commentary's <i>yajitabba-ṭhānabhūto,</i> 'who is become the place where oblations should be made.'</p>
