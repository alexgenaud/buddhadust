					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, in the house of Amitodana the Sākiyan, he was named Anuruddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Thus his elder brother was Mahānānama the Sākiyan, the son of the Master's paternal uncle. And he was reared most delicately and luxuriously, in a different house for each of the seasons, <a id="pg326"><span class="f2 g"><b>[326]</b></span></a> and was surrounded with dancers and mimes, enjoying a divinely good fortune. And when he was summoned with the Sākiyan rajas to form a guard for the Master, he went to him in the Mango Wood at Anupiyā, took orders, and within the period of the rains, acquired celestial vision. Again, receiving an exercise under the tuition of the General of the Norm, he went into the East Bamboo Wood, and studying, mastered seven of the thoughts of a great man, but could not learn the eighth. The Master, discerning this, taught it to him, teaching him the great course of the lineage of the Ariyans.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Remembering this lesson, Anuruddha developed insight and realized arahantship, accompanied by supernormal and analytic powers.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Him the Master ranked foremost among those who had attained the celestial eye.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> And he, dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, reviewed one day his achievement. And thrilled with joy, he breathed forth this psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v892"><span class="f2 c"><b>[892]</b></span></a> Forsaking mother, father, all his kin,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v905"><span class="f2 c"><b>[905]</b></span></a> No heaving breath left as He lay;<br />
							The mind in Jhana's steadfast stay,<br />
							With thought from every craving free,<br />
							Fixed on the Peace incessantly:<br />
							So passed the Man Who Saw away.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v906"><span class="f2 c"><b>[906]</b></span></a> With mind unshaken, as they came,<br />

					      Touch and the other senses of the Sage -<br />
							No other conscious states<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> shall come to be,<br />
							When one that's wholly Wake doth pass away.</p>

					<p>Now, a spirit,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> who in a former birth had been his attendant, seeing the Thera old and feeble, came, out of <a id="pg329"><span class="f2 g"><b>[329]</b></span></a> her former love for him, and bade him aspire to rebirth among the gods. But he made answer:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v908"><span class="f2 c"><b>[908]</b></span></a> Sojourn amid the company of gods<br />
					      Never again, seducer,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> comes for me.<br />
							Destroyed is all renewal of rebirth.<br />
							Now is there no more coming back to be.</p>

					<p>Then the other bhikkhus, not seeing the goddess, were wondering to whom the Thera was speaking. To show his mystic power to them he said this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v909"><span class="f2 c"><b>[909]</b></span></a> He who e'en in a moment by a thousand ways can take<br />

							But here's a brother versed in power of magic who doth see<br />
							What time [both men and gods], thou goddess, die and come to be.</p>

					<p>He now unfolds his former Karma: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v910"><span class="f2 c"><b>[910]</b></span></a> Lo! I was Annabhara long ago,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />A poor man working for my daily bread,<br />
							Then I to Upariṭṭha, the recluse<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v912"><span class="f2 c"><b>[912]</b></span></a> But I beheld the Buddha, the Awake,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v913"><span class="f2 c"><b>[913]</b></span></a> I know my former lives, and where and how<br />
