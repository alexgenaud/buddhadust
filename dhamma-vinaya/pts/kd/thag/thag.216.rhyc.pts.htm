					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī as the son of a brahmin of the Kosiya family,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> but was named Kātiyāna after the family of his mother. Seeing his friend Sāmaññakāni<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> become a Thera, he, too, entered the Order. While at his studies he determined to discipline himself at night as to sleep. While pacing on the terrace he dozed, overcome by sleepiness, and fell right there to the ground. The Master, seeing what had happened, went himself, and standing above him, called him 'Kātiyāna!' He thereat rose up, saluted, and stood much agitated. Then the Master taught him the Norm thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v411"><span class="f2 c"><b>[411]</b></span></a> Rise up, rouse thee, Kātiyāna, seat thee cross-legged.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Be not filled with drowsiness. Watch and keep vigil.<br />
							Child of heedless race, let not the King of Mortals<br />
							By a simple trick o'ercome thee self-indulgent.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v412"><span class="f2 c"><b>[412]</b></span></a> E'en as billow sweeping o'er the mighty ocean<br />
							So may round of birth and age o'erwhelm and drown thee.<br />
							See that thou dost make thyself an isle of safety,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> For nought else is there may serve thee as a refuge.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v413"><span class="f2 c"><b>[413]</b></span></a> <a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> Lo! for thee the Master hath prepared this Right Way,<br />
							Past all bonds and past all fear of birth and dying.<br />
							Be thou diligent when night is young, and after;<br />
							Strive with all thy might, and strenuous make thy study.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v414"><span class="f2 c"><b>[414]</b></span></a> Loose all earlier ties; live as befits a brother,<br />
							Robed in yellow cloak, by razor shaved, and alms fed.<br />
							Be not fain for pastimes, nor to lengthened slumbers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Be addicted. Contemplate, 0 Kātiyāna!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v415"><span class="f2 c"><b>[415]</b></span></a> Concentrate, conquer, O Kātiyāna! Make thee<br />
							Adept in the path to sure salvation leading.<br />
							Hast thou won the ultimate purification,<br />
							Thou shalt reach the Going-out, as flame in water.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v416"><span class="f2 c"><b>[416]</b></span></a> Light of feeble ray is as a wind-torn creeper.<br />
							So do thou, clansman of Indra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> clutching nothing,<br />
							Shake off Māra. Cleans'd of passion for sensations,<br />
							Wait thine hour, e'en here in holy coolness dwelling.</p>

					<p>Thus aided by the Master's homily to win the Nibbāna wherein is no residual base of rebirth, the Thera developed insight and attained arahantship. Thereafter he uttered the verses as taught by the Master in confessing <i>aññā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>Kosiyagotta. Kosiya</i> is one of the god Indra's names. The application of the simile of the light (lamp) is not, I venture to think, that Māra's death-torch was to be extinguished by Kosiya (<i>cf.</i> Neumann), but that his own rebirth - 'fire,' grown 'cool' and low, was in dying out to checkmate Māra's designs for his rebirth.</p>
