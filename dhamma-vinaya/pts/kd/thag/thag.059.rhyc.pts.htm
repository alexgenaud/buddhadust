					<p>His story resembles that of the Añjana-Woodlander, with this difference: after his novitiate, he dwelt in the forest by a village in the kingdom of Kosala, near the dwelling of a lay adherent. The latter, seeing him camped under a <a id="pg60"><span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span></a> tree, made a little hut and gave it him. There the Thera attained arahantship. Then filled with rapture at his emancipation, he uttered this psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v59"><span class="f2 c"><b>[59]</b></span></a> Strong in my faith<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> I left the world. Now here<br />
							Within the woods a hut is made for me;<br />
							And I with zeal and ardour meditate,<br />
							With watchful wit and clarity of mind.</p>

					<p>This was his confession of aññā, and because he dwelt so long in Kosala, he became known as the Kosala settler.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> 'When I saw the might of the Exalted One at Vesālī, I thought: "Absolutely able to guide is this doctrine and ordinance; therefore shall I verily through this attainment be set free from old age and death." And because of the faith thus arisen, I went forth' (Commentary). The last two lines in the stanza are an expansion of four adjectives, the sentence lacking expressed subject and predicate.</p>
