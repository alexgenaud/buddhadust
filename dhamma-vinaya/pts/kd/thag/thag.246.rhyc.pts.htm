					<p>Reborn before our Exalted One, in the village of Dona-vatthu, not far from Kapilavatthu, in a very wealthy brahmin family, he came to be called by his family name, Koṇḍañña. When grown up he knew the three Vedas, and excelled in runes concerning marks.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Now when our Bodhisat was born, he was among the eight brahmins sent for to prognosticate. And though he was quite a novice, he saw the marks of the Great Man on the infant, and said: 'Verily this one will be a Buddha!' So he lived, awaiting the Great Being's renunciation. When this happened in the Bodhisat's twenty-ninth year, Koṇḍañña heard of it, and left the world with four other sons of mark-interpreting brahmins, Vappa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and others, and for six years dwelt at <i>Uruvelā,</i> near the Bodhisat, during the latter's great struggle. Then when the Bodhisat ceased to fast, they were disgusted, and went to Isipatana. There the Buddha followed them, and preached his <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">Wheel sermon,</a> whereby Koṇḍañña and myriads of Brahma angels won the fruition of the first path. And on the fifth day, through the sermon on <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p59">'No Sign of any Soul,'</a> Koṇḍañña realized arahantship. Him the Master, later on, in conclave at the great Jeta Grove Vihara, ranked chief among those bhikkhus who were of long standing in the Order.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> And on one occasion Koṇḍañña's sermon on the Four Truths - a discourse bearing the impress of the three signs, dealing with non-substantiality, varied by divers methods, based on Nibbāna, and delivered with the Buddha's own fluency - so impressed Sakka the god that he uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v673"><span class="f2 c"><b>[673]</b></span></a> Hearing thy doctrine's mighty properties,<br />
							Lo! I thereby am more than satisfied.<br />
							Most passionless and pure the Norm thus taught,<br />
							From every form of grasping wholly free.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On another occasion the Thera, seeing how the minds of certain worldlings were mastered by wrong ideas, delivered himself on this wise:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v674"><span class="f2 c"><b>[674]</b></span></a> Many the motley pictures in the world,<br />
							Enjoyed within this earth's circumference,<br />
							Inciting, I do note, man's purposes,<br />
							Fair-seeming hopes, and linked with fierce desire.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v675"><span class="f2 c"><b>[675]</b></span></a> As dust by wind upchurned the rain-cloud lays,<br />
							So are those purposes composed and quenched,<br />
							When he by wisdom doth discern and see.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v676"><span class="f2 c"><b>[676]</b></span></a> When he by wisdom doth discern and see:<br />
							'Impermanent is everything in life,'<br />
							Then he at all this suffering feels disgust.<br />
							Lo! herein lies the way to purity.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a><a id="v677"><span class="f2 c"><b>[677]</b></span></a> When he by wisdom doth discern and see,<br />
							That 'Everything in life is bound to Ill'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Then he at all this suffering feels disgust.<br />
							Lo! herein lies the way to purity.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v678"><span class="f2 c"><b>[678]</b></span></a> That 'Everything in life is Void of Soul,'<br />
							Then he at all this suffering feels disgust.<br />
							Lo! herein lies the way to purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon he showed that he had himself attained this insight, confessing <i>aññā,</i> and saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v679"><span class="f2 c"><b>[679]</b></span></a> Brother Koṇḍañña., wakened by the Wake: -<br />
							Lo! he hath passed with vigour out and on;<br />
							Sloughed off hath he the dyings and the births,<br />
							Wholly accomplishing the life sublime.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v680"><span class="f2 c"><b>[680]</b></span></a> And be it 'flood'  or 'snare' or 'stumbling-stone,'<br />
							Or be it 'mountain' hard to rive in twain,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The net, the stumbling-stone I've hacked away,<br />
							And cloven is the rock so hard to break,<br />
							And crossed the flood. Rapt in ecstatic thought<br />
							I dwell, from bondage unto evil freed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now one day the Thera rebuked a bhikkhu, who had fallen into bad habits through unworthy friendships, and admonished him, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v681"><span class="f2 c"><b>[681]</b></span></a> A bhikkhu of distraught, unsteady mind,<br />
							Who doth associate with vicious friends,<br />
							In the great flood [of constant living] falls<br />
							Headlong and drowning sinks beneath its waves.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v682"><span class="f2 c"><b>[682]</b></span></a> But who, with concentrated, steady mind,<br />
							Discreet and self-restrained in heart and sense,<br />
							Doth wisely join himself to virtuous friends,<br />
							His it may be to put an end to Ill.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a><a id="v683"><span class="f2 c"><b>[683]</b></span></a> Lo! here1 a man with worn and pallid frame;<br />
							Like knotted stems of cane his joints, and sharp<br />
							Th'emaciated network of his veins;<br />
							In food and drink austerely temperate,<br />
							His spirit neither crushed nor desolate.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v684"><span class="f2 c"><b>[684]</b></span></a> In the great forest, in the mighty woods,<br />
							Touched though I be by gadfly and by gnat,<br />
							I yet would roam, like warrior-elephant,<br />
							In van of battle, mindful, vigilant.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v685"><span class="f2 c"><b>[685]</b></span></a> With thought<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> of death I dally not, nor yet<br />
							Delight in living. I await the hour<br />
							Like any hireling who hath done his task.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v686"><span class="f2 c"><b>[686]</b></span></a> With thought of death I dally not, nor yet<br />
							Delight in living. I await the hour<br />
							With mind discerning and with heedfulness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v687"><span class="f2 c"><b>[687]</b></span></a> The Master hath my fealty and love,<br />
							And all the Buddha's bidding hath been done.<br />
							Low have I laid the heavy load I bore,<br />
							Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.</p>
