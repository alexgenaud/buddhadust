					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the kingdom of Magadha, as the son of a burgess of the Kaccāna's, he was named Sambula, but was known as Sambula-Kaccāna.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> After he had heard the Master teach the Norm, and had entered the Order, he went to the neighbourhood of the Himālaya, and practised his insight exercises in a cave called Bhera-vāyana ('dreadful-passage').</p>

					<p>Now one day there arose a great storm-cloud out of season, towering high in the heavens, emitting roars of thunders, forked lightning, and rushing noise. And it began to rain, and thunderbolts burst. All creatures - bears, hyenas, buffaloes, elephants - cried out in fear and trembling. But the Thera had stirred up insight, and, careless as to body and life, heeded not the noise, but cooled by the storm so composed his mind, that he quickened insight, and won arahantship together with <i>abhiññā.</i></p>

					<p>Thereupon reflecting on his achievement he was filled with joy, and in a psalm confessed <i>aññā:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v189"><span class="f2 c"><b>[189]</b></span></a> God's rain pours down, ay, and god's rain roars down,<br />
							And I alone in fearsome hollow dwell.<br />
							Yet dwelling so in fearsome rocky dell<br />
							To me no fear comes nigh, no creeping dread,<br />
							No quailing [of my soul].</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v190"><span class="f2 c"><b>[190]</b></span></a> For such the law<br />
							Within the blessed Norm, that dwelling so<br />
							To me no fear comes nigh, no creeping dread,<br />
							No quailing [of my soul] to me, alone.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There was need to distinguish him from other Kaccānas - <i>e.g.,</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p229">CCXXIX.</a> In Phayre MS. and Br. Cy., Sampahula-.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The metre in these graceful gāthās I cartnot allocate under any of the textbook varieties. The words, 'For such ... Norm,' are an expansion of the Suttanta term, <i>Dhammatā (mam') esā-</i> 'This for me is Normness' (<i>cf.</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 8, n. 3; my Buddhism, p. 119). <i>Deva</i> (god), the Commentary, as before, paraphrases with <i>megha</i> (cloud).</p>
