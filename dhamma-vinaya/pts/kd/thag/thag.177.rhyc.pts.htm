					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the family of a Kosalan brahmin, he saw the Master work the twin miracle,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and believed. Entering the Order he fell ill while performing the studies of a recluse. His own people attended him and healed him. But he, greatly stirred by his recovery, pressed forward his study, and acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i> Thereupon he went through the air to his own people, and established them in the Refuges and the Precepts. And some of his kin, so established, died and were reborn in heaven. When Passika waited on the Master, the latter asked after the health of his kin. And Passika thus made answer:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v240"><span class="f2 c"><b>[240]</b></span></a> Though I alone, 'mong unbelieving kin,<br />
							Had faith and wit enough, discerned the Nonn<br />
							And clove to virtue, this was for their good.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v241"><span class="f2 c"><b>[241]</b></span></a> For see! mine own folk, whom for pity's sake<br />
							I took to task, roused and rebuked by me,<br />
							Through their affection and their piety<br />
							Constrained, towards the Brethren wrought good work.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v242"><span class="f2 c"><b>[242]</b></span></a> They who are now gone hence, ending this span,<br />
							They reap much happiness among the gods.<br />
							Brothers of mine are there, my mother too,<br />
							Fain for the pleasures that they now enjoy.</p>
