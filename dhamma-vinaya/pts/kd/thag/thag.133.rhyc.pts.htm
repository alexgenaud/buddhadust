					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age as the son of one who was a tenant-in-chief of the King of Kosala, and in command of bandits,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he succeeded to his father's position at the latter's death. Converted on seeing the Buddha accept the Jeta Grove, he put his younger brother in his place, left the world, and soon after won arahantship. He thereupon sought to turn his brother to a better life, and on seeing him attached to it, urged him in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v145"><span class="f2 c"><b>[145]</b></span></a> The days, the nights flit by and pass away.<br />
							Life is arrested, and the span<br />
							To mortals given is consumed and fails,<br />
							Like water in the shallow mountain streams.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v146"><span class="f2 c"><b>[146]</b></span></a> But evil actions still the fool commits,<br />
							Nor understands how dire the aftermath,<br />
							Till comes the bitter hour of action's fruit.</p>

					<p>Hearing the Thera's homily, the brother besought the king's leave, and left the world, and not long after found salvation.</p>
