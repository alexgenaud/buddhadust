					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the Sākiyan clan, he came to be known only by his gens name. He found faith when the Master visited his kinsfolk, and entering the Order and studying for insight, acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i> Now, while <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> he was dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, his kinsfolk asked him one day why he had put them aside and gone forth. And he, to show both the ill he had suffered in <i>Saṃsāra</i> and the happiness of <i>Nibbāna</i> which he then had gotten, said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v258"><span class="f2 c"><b>[258]</b></span></a> Lo! as I fared through being, I came to the kingdom infernal,<br />
							So to the dolorous realm of the Petas, times without number.<br />
							Evil<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> befell me again in manifold shapes of the beast-world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v259"><span class="f2 c"><b>[259]</b></span></a> Glad enough reborn as human, rarely I won to the heavens.<br />
							Yea, in the realms of vision, in realms where all sense was abolished<br />
							Have I been placed, and in realms 'twixt consciousness and the unconscious.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v260"><span class="f2 c"><b>[260]</b></span></a> All this becoming lies clearly before me as void of real value,<br />
							Born of preceding conditions, unstable and constantly drifting.<br />
							So comprehending the coming to be of this self of me, heedful,<br />
							Came I at length to find Peace, yea, the Peace [wherein I am resting].</p>
