					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in the family of a commoner of Magadha, and named Subhūta, his disposition to seek <a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> escape caused him to quit domestic life and to join sectarian ascetics. Finding among them nothing genuine, and seeing the happiness enjoyed by Upatissa, Kolita, Sela<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and others, after they had entered the Order, he believed in our doctrine and entered also. After winning the favour of his teachers and preceptors, be went into retreat with an exercise. And developing insight he won arahantship.</p>

					<p>Thereupon he declared <i>aññā</i> bv reviewing the suffering he had endured by self-mortification, and his subsequent happiness in <i>jhāna,</i> etc.:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v320"><span class="f2 c"><b>[320]</b></span></a> A man who yokes himself to things unfit,<br />
							Desiring<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to accomplish work therein,<br />
							If seeking he doth not attain, his quest<br />
							Doth bear the intrinsic markings of mischance.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v321"><span class="f2 c"><b>[321]</b></span></a> If he surrender but one [vantage-point]<br />
							Of misery['s source] drawn out and overcome,<br />
							Like luckless throw of dice his state may be.<br />
							But if he throw all [he hath gained] away,<br />
							No better is he than a blinded man,<br />
							Who sees not if the road be smooth or rough.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v322"><span class="f2 c"><b>[322]</b></span></a> Of him who talketh much, but doeth not,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Upatissa is Sāriputta, Kolita is Moggallāna. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p259">CCLIX.,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p263">CCLXIII.,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p253">CCLIII.</a> The two former were of his own country; Sela was from the country lying north of Magadha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary we are to read <i>icchato</i> as = <i>icckante</i>. Dr. Oldenberg supports this by parallels from Sistert, verse 240:</p>

					<p class="in4"><i>Who, ignorant <i>(ajānato)</i> to the ignorant, hath told thee this?'</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">for <i>ajānanto</i> (<i>Saɱy.,</i> i. 11; <i>Dīpavaɱsa,</i> xxi., verse 2).</p>

							<p><i>Aghāni.</i> Agonies.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The metre of this one <i>gāthā</i> is very curious and irregular, nor can the Commentary throw much light on its original phraseology. It decides that <i>aghataɱ</i> stands for three <i>aghāni's</i> (miseries) - viz., greed, hate, and illusion. The Br. MS. makes no attempt to correct this term by references to value <i>(aggha),</i> as does the S. MS. Yet this <i>gāthā</i> fits in better with the legend than do the platitudes that follow ( = verse 226). It is the language of one who has sacrificed his all to win.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> = <i>Dhammapada,</i> verses 51, 52.</p>
