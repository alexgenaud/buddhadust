					<p>He, by his karma, was reborn in the age of our Exalted One at Sāvatthī, as the child of a slave of Anāthapiṇḍika, <a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> and was by him appointed as gate-porter of the Vihara.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Hearing of his virtuous conduct and his wishes, his master made him a freed man, and said, how happy it was to leave the life of the world. He was ordained accordingly; but from that time he grew slothful and slack of effort, taking no steps to roll back the round of rebirth, and sleeping much after meals. At sermon-time he would get into a corner on the outskirts of the congregation, and sit snoring. Now the Exalted One, contemplating his antecedents, spoke the following verse to him in order to stir up agitation:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v17"><span class="f2 c"><b>[17]</b></span></a> Who waxes slothful and in diet gross,<br />
							Given to sleep and rolling as he lies,<br />
							Like a great hog with provender replete -<br />
							The dolt comes back again, again to birth.</p>

					<p>Hearing this, Dasaka grew agitated and, developing insight, not long after realized arahantship. Thereafter he thought 'the verse of the Exalted One became as a goad to me,' and he repeated the verse. Thus, though uttered as a protest concerning food, it became the declaration of his <i>aññā.</i></p>
