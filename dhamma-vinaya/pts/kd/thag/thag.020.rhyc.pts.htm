					<p>He was reborn, when our Master was living, at Sāvatthī, as the son of the brahmin who was price-assessor<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> to the king of Kosala. He became an ascetic as follower of Bavarī, the learned brahmin, who dwelt in the Kapiṭṭha park on the banks of the Godhāvarī. Now Bavari<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> sent him, together with Tissa and Metteyya, to the Master. And Ajita was so satisfied with the Master's answers to his questions, that he entered the Order. Choosing a form of mental exercise he developed insight, and attained arahant-ship. Thereupon he uttered his song of victory<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v20"><span class="f2 c"><b>[20]</b></span></a> All unafraid of death, nor fain to live,<br />
							I shall lay down this compound frame anon,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							With mind alert, with consciousness controlled.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In the Jāitaka it appears that the purchase of goods by or for a king was effected by an officially regulated price. This was fixed without appeal by the court assessor or valuer, who stood between the two fires of offending the king if he valued the goods submitted too high, and of driving away tradesmen if he refused bribes and cheapened wares. See my 'Early Economic Conditions in Northern India,' <i>JRAS,</i> October, 1901.</p>
