					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī, as the son of a wealthy councillor. Come to years of discretion, he was convinced by the majesty of the Buddha, at the presentation of the Jeta Grove, and left the world. Fulfilling his novitiate, and dwelling in the forest, he came to the Master to learn. And at that time the Master, seeing <a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> Sāriputta rapt in contemplation near him, broke forth into this psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought, etc.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>And the brother hearing him, even when once more far away, and for a long time in the forest, kept repeating the psalm ever and anon, so that it became customary to call him 'Ekudaniya,' 'One-Psalm-er.'</p>

					<p>Now one day he got unity and concentration of mind, and so, insight expanding, he won arahantship. And dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, he was once invited by the Treasurer of the Norm<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> to be tested in exposition, with the words: 'Friend, expound the doctrine to me.' And from long dwelling in mind over that verse, he uttered it then again:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v68&lt;&gt;"><span class="f2 c"><b>[68]</b></span></a> He who doth dwell on highest plane of thought,<br />
							With zeal unfaltering, Sage, Arahant,<br />
							In wisdom's branches<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> trained: - such as he is,<br />
							No sorrows may beset him, who with mind<br />
							Calm and serene and clear abideth aye.</p>

					<p>This became the confession of his <i>aññā.</i></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> So the Commentary; in the text Ekuddāniya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Narrated in <i>Udāna,</i> iv. 7. <i>Dhammapada,</i> verse 259, is; by the Commentator, ascribed to the Buddha, who was commending 'Ekuddāna's' fruitful use of his one stanza.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> A title given to Ānauda. See Ps. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p260">CCLX.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The Commentary emphasizes the mutual equivalence of <i>muni</i> (sage) and <i>araha.</i> It also specifies the thirty-seven 'wings of wisdom' (see <i>Compendium,</i> p. 179), and the three <i>sikkhās,</i> or trainings - viz., in morals, in <i>jhāna</i> or mental control, and in insight or doctrine <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.088.pali.bd.htm">(<i>Ang.</i> i. 235).</a> In the <i>Sutta-Vibhanga</i> of the <i>Vinaya-Piṭaka</i> this psalm is put into the mouth of Panthaka the Less, to whom in the pressnt work <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p236"><i>Ps.</i> CCXXXVI.</a> is ascribed. The Sisters at the Sāvatthī College are represented as expecting no effective lesson when it is <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/culapanthako.htm">Panthaka's</a> turn to teach them, since he always repeated one and the same stanza - namely, that here attributed to Ekudaniya. The Thera hears of their remarks, and forthwith gives an exhibition both of his magical power and of his knowledge of much else of the 'Buddha-word.' Whereupon he reaps the Sisters' tribute of admiration.</p>
