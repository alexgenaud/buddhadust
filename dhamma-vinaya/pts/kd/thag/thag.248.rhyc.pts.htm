					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age as the sister's son of the Thera Sankicca,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he left the world under his uncle's tuition, and while only a novice, won arahantship. And dwelling in the bliss of fruition, he wished for full ordination, and went home to ask his mother's leave. Now as he went, he fell in with highwaymen on the look-out for an offering to their deity, and they seized on him as a suitable sacrifice. He, thus assailed, stood undaunted and without blenching. Then the robber-chief was amazed, and commended him, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v705"><span class="f2 c"><b>[705]</b></span></a> Of all the lot whom we, for god<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> or pelf,<br />
							Have smitten in our time, there's not been one<br />
							But hath shown fear, trembled and clamoured sore.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v706"><span class="f2 c"><b>[706]</b></span></a> But thou, who'rt not affrighted, nay, whose face<br />
							Shows brighter bloom,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> why dost thou not lament.<br />
							When such a fearsome peril threatens thee?</p>

					<p><a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Adhimutta:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v707"><span class="f2 c"><b>[707]</b></span></a> No misery of mind, O chief, is there<br />
							For him who hath no wants. All fear have I<br />
							Transcended, since the Fetters were destroyed.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v708"><span class="f2 c"><b>[708]</b></span></a> By death of that which leadeth to rebirth,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The truths are seen e'en as they really are,<br />
							And hence in death there lies no fear for me,<br />
							Tis as a laying down the load I bore.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v709"><span class="f2 c"><b>[709]</b></span></a> Well have I lived the holy life, and well<br />
							Made progress in the Ariyan Path; no fear<br />
							There lies in death, who puts an end to ills.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v710"><span class="f2 c"><b>[710]</b></span></a> Void of delight the forms of birth appear,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Like drinking poison one has thrown away.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v711"><span class="f2 c"><b>[711]</b></span></a> He who hath passed beyond, from grasping free,<br />
							Whose task is done, sane and immune, is glad,<br />
							Not sorry, when the term of lives is reached,<br />
							As one who from the slaughter-house escapes.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v712"><span class="f2 c"><b>[712]</b></span></a> He who the ideal order<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> hath attained,<br />
							All the world over seeking nought to own,<br />
							As one who from a burning house escapes,<br />
							When death is drawing nigh he grieveth not.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v713"><span class="f2 c"><b>[713]</b></span></a> All things soever which have come to be,<br />
							And all rebirth wherever it is got,<br />
							Nowhere therein is personal design: -<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
							So hath the mighty Sage declared to us.</p>

							As by the Buddha it is taught, no more<br />
							Would he take hold of any form of birth<br />
							Than he would grasp a red-hot iron ball.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v715"><span class="f2 c"><b>[715]</b></span></a> Comes not to me the thought: ''Tis I have been,'<br />
							Nor comes the thought: 'What shall I next become?'<br />
							Thoughts, deeds and words are no persisting [soul],<br />
							Therefore what ground for lamentations here?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v716"><span class="f2 c"><b>[716]</b></span></a> To him who seeth, as it really is,<br />
							The pure and simple<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> causal rise of things,<br />
							The pure and simple sequence of our acts: -<br />
							To such an one can come no fear, O chief.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v717"><span class="f2 c"><b>[717]</b></span></a> That all this world is like the forest grass<br />
							And brushwood [no man's property] when one<br />
							By wisdom seeth this, finds naught that's 'Mine,'<br />
							Thinking: ''tis not for me,' he grieveth not.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v718"><span class="f2 c"><b>[718]</b></span></a> This body irketh me; no seeker I<br />
							To live. This mortal frame will broken be,<br />
							And ne'er another from it be reborn.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v719"><span class="f2 c"><b>[719]</b></span></a> Your business with my body, come, that do<br />
							E'en as ye will; and not on that account<br />
							Will hatred or affection rise in me.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v720"><span class="f2 c"><b>[720]</b></span></a> The young men marvelled at his words, and thrilled<br />
							With awe, casting away their knives they said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v721"><span class="f2 c"><b>[721]</b></span></a> What are your honour's practices,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> or who<br />
							Is teacher to you? Of whose Ordinance<br />
							A member, have you gained this grieflessness?</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Adhimutta:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v722"><span class="f2 c"><b>[722]</b></span></a> My teacher is the Conqueror knowing all<br />
							And seeing all, the Master infinite<br />
							In pity, all the world's Physician, He.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v723"><span class="f2 c"><b>[723]</b></span></a> <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> And He it is by whom these, truths are taught,<br />
							Norm to Nibbāna leading, unsurpassed.<br />
							Within His Rule I've won this grieflessness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v724"><span class="f2 c"><b>[724]</b></span></a> Now when the robbers heard the well-spoke utterance of the sage,<br />
							They laid aside their knives, their arms, and some forsook that trade,<br />
							And some besought that they might leave the world for holy life.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v725"><span class="f2 c"><b>[725]</b></span></a> They leaving thus, within the Buddha's welcome Rule<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> grew wise,<br />
							The seven Factors practising and eke the Forces five,<br />
							Trained in the Powers, with hearts elate, happy they reached the Goal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Adhimutta was a young novice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Bhavanetti</i> - <i>i.e.,</i> <i>taṇhā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Lit., diseases. <i>Cf.</i> Tennyson's <i>Elaine:</i></p>

							<p class="in4"><i>'And sweet is death who puts an end to pain.'</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> That 'life is not worth living,' which is Dr. Neumann's rendering, seems to me scarcely sound Buddhism. Life can yield arahantship - the thing supremely worth having, the crown of all previous upward effort. 'Rebecomings are unsatisfying'; <i>'nirassādā bhavā'</i> is the literal rendering of the text. We need to leave our own 'saws' behind in getting at the Buddhist standpoint.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammataɱ uttamaɱ</i> - <i>i.e.,</i> 'the nature of the Norm; in, and because of, completed arahantship' (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Nā-issaraɱ</i> - lit., that which has no lord or ruler; <i>issāra</i> is used for a personal creator.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Lit., 'will pass away.' 'Soul' is supplied from the Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Suddhaɱ,</i> pure, unmixed - <i>i.e.,</i> with <i>attā;</i> phenomenal process only: <i>dhammamattappavatti</i> (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Tapas:</i> religious austerities or magic (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Lit., the rule of the Welcome <i>(su-gata),</i> a title often used for the Buddha. For Factors, Forces, and Powers, see <i>Compendium,</i> p. 180, called factors, powers, faculties, respectively. 'Reached the Goal' — lit., 'touched (attained) the state of Nibbāna, the unconditioned.' The Commentary adds that the youthful saint went imperturbably on his way, obtained his mother's consent to enter the Order, and was ordained by his uncle. On verse 722 Dhammapāla refers to his own Commentary on the <i>Iti-vuttaka.</i></p>
