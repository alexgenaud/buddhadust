					<p>Reborn before the manifestation of our Exalted One at Sāvatthī, in a brahmin family from Udicca,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he grew up an expert in the Vedas and an unrivalled orator.</p>

					<p>Now our Exalted One, having arisen and started the rolling of the wheel of the Norm, after converting Yasa and his friends,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> came on to Sāvatthī at the urgent request of Anāthapiṇḍika. Gotama the brahmin saw and heard him, and asked for ordination. Ordained by a bhikkhu at the Master's bidding, he attained arahantship even as his hair was being shaved. After a long residence in the Kosala country, he returned to Sāvatthī. And many of his relations, eminent brahmins, waited upon him and asked him which, of the many gospels<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> as guides to life that were current, he judged should be followed. He addressed them thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v587"><span class="f2 c"><b>[587]</b></span></a> Let the recluse discern his own real good,<br />
							And let him well consider all the Word<br />
							He heareth preached, and what therein beseems<br />
							The holy life whereunto he hath come.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v588"><span class="f2 c"><b>[588]</b></span></a> Religious friendships in the Rule, a course<br />
							Of ample training, and the wish to hear<br />
							Men fit to teach: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v589"><span class="f2 c"><b>[589]</b></span></a> For Buddhas reverence; towards the Norm<br />
							Honour sincere; for the Fraternity<br />
							Care and esteem: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v590"><span class="f2 c"><b>[590]</b></span></a> Of decorous habit and in living pure,<br />
							In conduct blameless, and the intelligence<br />
							<a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> Adjusted well: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v591"><span class="f2 c"><b>[591]</b></span></a> In what he does and what he leaves undone<br />
							Using deportment that doth favour find;<br />
							To higher training of the heart and mind<br />
							Fervently given: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v592"><span class="f2 c"><b>[592]</b></span></a> Haunts of the forest, lone, remote, where sounds<br />
							May hardly come, 'mong these the earnest sage<br />
							Should make his choice: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v593"><span class="f2 c"><b>[593]</b></span></a> And virtue, and much learning, and research<br />
							To know how in themselves things really are,<br />
							Grasp of the Truths: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v594"><span class="f2 c"><b>[594]</b></span></a> To meditate upon the Impermanent,<br />
							And on the absence of all soul, and on<br />
							The foul, and in the world to find no charm<br />
							To bind the heart: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v595"><span class="f2 c"><b>[595]</b></span></a> To meditate on Wisdom's seven arms,<br />
							On paths to mystic potency, on powers<br />
							And forces five, and on the eightfold Path,<br />
							The Ariyan<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v596"><span class="f2 c"><b>[596]</b></span></a> Let the true sage put Craving far away;<br />
							Let him uproot and crush the Intoxicants;<br />
							Let him live Free: - this the recluse beseems.</p>

					<p>Thus the Thera, in praising the course suitable to a recluse, magnified the efficiency of his Order, and contrariwise the ineffectualness of a recluse not of it. Then those brahmins, mightily approving of the Rule, were established in the precepts and so forth.</p>

Apparently none of the three Theras called Gotama (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p129">CXXIX.,</a> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p183">CLXXXIII.,</a> and above) was this doctrinaire.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Cf. 'Ariyan' conveyed to Buddhists much what our 'Christian' does to us. Originally a racial term, it had come to mean 'noble, gentle,' and specifically, a saintly 'confessor' of the Dhamma. These subjects are the thirty-seven <i>'bodhipakkhiyā dhamma,'</i> or Factors of Enlightenment, less the four Onsets of Mindfulness (verses 166, 352) and the four Supreme Efforts. See <i>Compendium,</i> p. 179 <i>f.</i></p>
