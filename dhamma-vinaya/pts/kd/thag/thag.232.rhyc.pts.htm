					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a suburb of the city of Sāketa as the son of a wealthy councillor, he was the last and only surviving child, the others having been devoured by a hostile Yakkha. He was therefore well guarded, but the demon <i>(bhūta)</i> had meanwhile gone to wait on Vessavaṇa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and came back no more - On the child's naming day he was called Bhūta, for they said: 'May compassionate non-humans protect him!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> He by virtue of his merit having grown up without accident, reared with three residences as was Yasa,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> went, when the Master came to Sāketa, with other laymen to the Vihāra and heard the Norm. Entering the Order, he went to dwell in a cave on the banks of the River Ajakaraṇī.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> There he won arahantship. Thereafter, he visited his relatives out of kindness to them, staying himself in the Añjana Wood.

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v519"><span class="f2 c"><b>[519]</b></span></a> When the fell poisoner<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> he hath banned who bringeth pain, -<br />
