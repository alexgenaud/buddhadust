					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a family of very eminent brahmins, his mother died just prior to his birth, so that he was discovered unburnt upon the funeral pyre. For the life of a being in his last birth cannot perish ere he attain arahantship, even if he fell down Mount Sineru. At seven years of age, when he heard of his mother dying at his birth, he was thrilled, and said, 'I will leave the world.' So they brought him to Sāriputta. And he won arahantship even as his hair was being cut off. How he offered his life to brigands to save 8,000 bhikkhus is told in the Dhammapada Commentary.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Now a certain layman, desiring to wait upon him, asked him to dwell in the neighbourhood, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v597"><span class="f2 c"><b>[597]</b></span></a> What is the gain for thee, dear lad,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> to dwell<br />
							During the rains within the distant woods,<br />
							Like Ujjuhāna, marshy, jungle-crowned?<br />
							Sweeter for thee Verambhā, Cave of Winds,<br />
							Since they who meditate must dwell apart.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="pg267"><span class="f2 g"><b>[267]</b></span></a> Then the Thera, to show the charm of the forest and other things, replied:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v598"><span class="f2 c"><b>[598]</b></span></a> E'en as the wind of the monsoon blows up<br />
							And all around the cloud-wrack, in the rains,<br />
							[So in the forest lone, remote, arise]<br />
							The thoughts that with detachment harmonize,<br />
							And all my spirit whelm and overspread.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v599"><span class="f2 c"><b>[599]</b></span></a> 'Twas the dun-feathered one,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> in charnel-field<br />
							Going his rounds, that made to rise in me<br />
							Clear thought about this body, passion-purged.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v600"><span class="f2 c"><b>[600]</b></span></a> Moreover, he whom others need not guard,<br />
							He too who hath no others whom to guard: -<br />
							Even the bhikkhu, dwells in happy ease,<br />
							Regardless of what men desire and love.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v601"><span class="f2 c"><b>[601]</b></span></a> Crags where clear waters lie, a rocky world,<br />
							Haunted by black-faced apes and timid deer,<br />
							Where 'neath bright blossoms run the silver streams: -<br />
							Those are the highlands of my heart's delight.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v602"><span class="f2 c"><b>[602]</b></span></a> I've dwelt in forests and in mountain caves,<br />
							In rocky gorges and in haunts remote,<br />
							And where the creatures of the wild do roam;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v603"><span class="f2 c"><b>[603]</b></span></a> But never mine the quest, with ill-will fraught,<br />
							Ungentle and ignoble .<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> - 'Let us hunt,<br />
							Let's slay these creatures, let us work them ill!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> <a id="v604"><span class="f2 c"><b>[604]</b></span></a> The Master hath my fealty and love,<br />
							And all the Buddha's bidding hath been done.<br />
							Low have I laid the heavy load I bore;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v605"><span class="f2 c"><b>[605]</b></span></a> The Good for which I bade the world farewell,<br />
							And left the home a homeless life to lead,<br />

							And every bond and fetter is destroyed.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v606"><span class="f2 c"><b>[606]</b></span></a> With thought of death I dally not, nor yet<br />
