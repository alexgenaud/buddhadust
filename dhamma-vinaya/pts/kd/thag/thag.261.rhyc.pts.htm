					<p>Our Master had already arisen, and was turning the Wheel of the Norm, and staying at Rājagaha, when at the brahmin village of Mahā-tittha in Magadha, this Thera was reborn as Pippali-mānava, the son of the chief wife of Kapila the brahmin. Four years later <i>Bhaddā Kapilānī</i> was reborn of the chief wife of the Kosiya-gotta brahmin at Sāgalā in the kingdom of Madda.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Now Pippali-mānava, refused to marry. 'While you live,' he told his parents, 'I will take care of you: afterwards I shall leave the world.' But to appease his mother he had a statue made of a beautiful maiden, dressed in crimson and ornaments, and showed it her saying: 'Mother, if I find anyone like this, I will lead the domestic life.' His mother was a clever lady, and sent brahmins forth, with the statue, on that quest. They came to Sāgalā, and setting the statue by the river's edge, sat down apart. Now Bhaddā's nurse, who had bathed her charge, and gone down again for her own bath, saw the statue, and thinking: 'What! is my <a id="pg360"><span class="f2 g"><b>[360]</b></span></a> young lady so ill bred?' slapped it on the cheek, and discovered it was not Bhadda, but a gold statue. The brahmins accosted her, inquiring about her mistress, and she brought them to the house of Kosiyagotta, where they were made welcome. And they sent word to Kapila:</p>

					<p>'We have got the maiden; do you act accordingly.' But Pippali-mānava and Bhaddā, being both unwilling to marry, wrote secretly each to the other, thus - He: 'Bhadda!' and she: 'Sir!' 'May you obtain a ménage suitable to your birth and fortune. I shall leave the world. Do not act so as to regret hereafter.' Now the two letter-bearers met, questioned each other, read the letters, and said: 'Look at the work of these children!' Throwing away the letters in the forest, they wrote others and took them. So the marriage was celebrated. But the wedded pair spent the night separated by a chain of flowers. And when Pippali-mānava's parents died, he and Bhadda decided one day, after they had dined and talked together, to renounce the world.</p>

					<p>And they got out yellow raiment from their wardrobes, and cut off each other's hair, slung bowls from their shoulder, passed out through their weeping servants, to all of whom they gave their freedom, and departed together, Pippali-mānava walking in front.</p>

					<p>And looking back, he thought: 'Here is Bhaddā Kapilānī, a woman worth the whole of India, walking at my heels. Someone seeing us will think: "These have renounced the world, but cannot do without each other." So, falsely accusing us, they may incur danger of purgatory.' And he told Bhadda this, and she agreed that a woman must needs be a hindrance to the male recluse. So they settled, at the cross roads, that he should go right and she left. Then the earth, though it could bear all Sineru, trembled at the weight of such virtue.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> And the supreme Buddha, seated in the fragrant chamber of the great vihāra in the Bamboo Wood, knew what the earthquake signified, and gathering eighty chief Theras <a id="pg361"><span class="f2 g"><b>[361]</b></span></a> together, he walked three leagues on the road, and seated himself at the foot of the Bahuputtaka Banyan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> between Rājagaha and Nālandā. And though he was clad in a ragged robe, the Buddha-rays shone forth from him and darted to and fro, and the tree took on different colours. Then Kassapa the Great<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> perceived: 'This will be our Master, through whom I have left the world.' And bending low, he said: 'The lord, the Exalted One, is my Master! I am his disciple.' And the Exalted One said: 'Sit, Kassapa, and I will show thee thine inheritance.' And in three homilies he gave him ordination. So they returned to Rājagaha, Kassapa exchanging his new robe for the Master's old one,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and with humility and zeal determining to practise the thirteen dhutangas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> And on the eighth day thereafter he won arahantship with thorough grasp of the spirit and letter of the Norm. Him the Master pronounced chief among those who undertook the extra austerities. And he, by way of showing the charm of detachment, told his experiences, in admonishing the brethren, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>I.</b></p>

					<p>On seeing bhikkhus mingling with crowds, and frequenting laymen's houses:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1051"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1051]</b></span></a> Walk not where many folk would make thee chief.<br />
							Dizzy the mind becomes,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> and hard to win<br />
							Is concentrated thought. And he who knows:<br />
							'Ill bodes the company of many folk,'<br />
							Will keep himself aloof from haunt of crowds.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg362"><span class="f2 g"><b>[362]</b></span></a> <a id="v1052"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1052]</b></span></a> Go not, 0 sage, to hearths of citizens.<br />
							Who<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> greedy seeks to taste life's feast entire,<br />
							Neglects the good that brings true happiness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1053"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1053]</b></span></a> A treacherous bog it is, this patronage<br />
							Of bows and gifts and treats from wealthy folk.<br />
							'Tis like a fine dart, bedded in the flesh,<br />
							For erring human hard to extricate.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>II.</b></p>

					<p>An exhortation to bhikkhus to practice content respecting the four necessaries of life:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1054"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1054]</b></span></a> Down from my mountain-lodge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> I came one day<br />
							And made my round for alms about the streets.<br />
							A leper there I saw eating his meal,<br />
							[And as was meet, that he might have achance,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>]<br />
							In [silent] courtesy I halted at his side.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1055"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1055]</b></span></a> He with his hand all leprous and diseased<br />
							Put in my bowl a morsel; as he threw,<br />
							A finger, mortifying, broke and fell.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1056"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1056]</b></span></a> Leaning against a wall I ate my share,<br />
							Nor at the time nor after felt disgust.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1057"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1057]</b></span></a> For only he who taketh as they come<br />
							The scraps of food, medicine from excrement,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The couch beneath the tree, the patchwork robe,<br />
							Stands as a man in north, south, east, or west.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>III.</b></p>

					<p>When he was asked, in his latter years: 'How is your reverence able at your time of life day after day to climb the hills?</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1058"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1058]</b></span></a> Where some do perish as they climb the rocks,<br />
							Heir of the Buddha,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> mindful, self-possessed,<br />
							<a id="pg363"><span class="f2 g"><b>[363]</b></span></a> By forces of the spirit fortified,<br />
							Doth Kassapa ascend the mountain brow.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1059"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1059]</b></span></a> Returning from the daily round for alms,<br />
							Kassapa mounts some craggy coign and sits<br />
							In meditation rapt, nor clutching aught,<br />
							For far from him hath he put fear and dread.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1060"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1060]</b></span></a> Returning from the daily round for alms,<br />
							Kassapa mounts some craggy coign and sits<br />
							In meditation rapt, nor clutching aught,<br />
							For he 'mong those that burn is cool and still.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1061"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1061]</b></span></a> Returning from the daily round for alms,<br />
							Kassapa mounts some craggy coign and sits<br />
							In meditation rapt, nor clutching aught,<br />
							His task is done, and he is sane, immune.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>IV.</b></p>

					<p>On being asked further: 'But why does your reverence at your time of life dwell in the mountain-jungle? Is not the Bamboo Grove, or others like it pleasant to you? he replied:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1062"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1062]</b></span></a> Those upland glades delightful to the soul,<br />
							Where the kareri spreads its wildering wreaths,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Where sound the trumpet-calls of elephants:<br />
							Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg364"><span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span></a> <a id="v1063"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1063]</b></span></a> Those rocky heights with hue of dark blue clouds,<br />
							Where lies embosomed many a shining tarn<br />
							Of crystal-clear, cool waters, and whose slopes<br />
							The 'herds of Indra' cover and bedeck:<br />
							Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1064"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1064]</b></span></a> Like serried battlements of blue-black cloud,<br />
							Like pinnacles on stately castle built,<br />
							Re-echoing to the cries of jungle folk:<br />
							Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1065"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1065]</b></span></a> Fair uplands rain-refreshed, and resonant<br />
							With crested creatures' cries antiphonal,<br />
							Lone heights where silent Rishis oft resort:<br />
							Those are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1066"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1066]</b></span></a> Here is enough for me who fain would dwell<br />
							In meditation rapt, mindful and tense.<br />
							Here is enough for me, who fain would seek<br />
							The highest good, a brother filled with zeal.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1067"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1067]</b></span></a> Here is enough for me, who fain would dwell<br />
							In happy ease, a brother filled with zeal.<br />
							Here is enough for me who give myself<br />
							To studious toil, so am I filled with zeal.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1068"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1068]</b></span></a> Clad with the azure bloom of flax, blue-flecked<br />
							As sky in autumn; quick with crowds<br />
							Of all their varied winged populace:<br />
							Such are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1069"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1069]</b></span></a> Free from the crowds of citizens below,<br />
							But thronged with flocks of many winged things,<br />
							The home of herding creatures of the wild:<br />
							Such are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1070"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1070]</b></span></a> Crags<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> where clear waters lie, a rocky world,<br />
							Haunted by black-faced apes and timid deer,<br />
							Where 'neath bright blossoms run the silver streams:<br />
							Such are the braes wherein my soul delights.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg365"><span class="f2 g"><b>[365]</b></span></a> <a id="v1071"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1071]</b></span></a> For that which brings me exquisite delight<br />
							Is not the strains of string and pipe and drum,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span><br />
							But when, with intellect well poised, intent,<br />
							I gain the perfect vision of the Norm.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>V.</b></p>

					<p>When admonishing bhikkhus delighting in secular activities and greedy as to gifts of things needful for life, he said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1072"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1072]</b></span></a> Let not a brother occupy himself<br />
							With busy works; let him keep clear of folk,<br />
							Nor strive [to copy nor to emulate].<br />
							Who greedy seeks to taste life's feast entire,<br />
							Neglects the good that brings true happiness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1073"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1073]</b></span></a> Let not a brother occupy himself<br />
							With busy works; let him keep clear of this<br />
							That nowise tendeth to his real good;<br />
							The body toils and suffers weariness,<br />
							And thus afflicted he attains no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>VI.</b></p>

					<p>The following verses were spoken to admonish on certain occasions:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1074"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1074]</b></span></a> By mere repeating with a muttering lip,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span><br />
							We see not e'en ourselves for what we are;<br />
							And so, stiff-necked, we go about and deem:<br />
							'A better man am I than he, than they!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1075"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1075]</b></span></a> No better, truly, is the fool, and yet<br />
							He deems himself to be the better man.<br />
							But him, poor creature of a stiff-necked mind,<br />
							Commend not they who truly understand.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg366"><span class="f2 g"><b>[366]</b></span></a> <a id="v1076"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1076]</b></span></a> Who is not exercised about himself,<br />
							In this way or in that:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> - 'the better man<br />
							Am I'; 'no better, I'; or 'I am worse,'<br />
							Or yet again 'I am as good as he' -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1077"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1077]</b></span></a> He who doth really know, and speaketh truth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Whose heart in righteousness is well composed,<br />
							And holdeth fast the saint's serenity,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Him do they praise, who truly understand.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1078"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1078]</b></span></a> He who among his fellow-brethren wins<br />
							No reverence, is far from the good Norm<br />
							As is the firmament far from the earth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1079"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1079]</b></span></a> But they who well have planted modesty<br />
							And eke discretion alway in their heart,<br />
							They in the holy life do richly thrive;<br />
							For them rebirths are ever at an end.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1080"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1080]</b></span></a> A brother who, though clad in patchwork robe,<br />
							Is of a puffed-up and unsteady mind,<br />
							As 'twere a monkey in a lion's hide,<br />
							No glory from his gear august doth gain.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1081"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1081]</b></span></a> But who, with uninflated, steadfast mind,<br />
							Is prudent, with his senses well controlled,<br />
							He shineth glorious in a patchwork robe,<br />
							As lion in the sombre mountain cave.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>VII.</b></p>

					<p>On witnessing the gods of the Brahmā world doing obeisance to the Venerable Sāriputta, and marking how the Venerable Kappina smiled:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1082"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1082]</b></span></a> See how they stand, those thronging deities Of mystic potency and glorious,<br />
							Ten times a thousand, all of Brahma's heaven,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg367"><span class="f2 g"><b>[367]</b></span></a> <a id="v1083"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1083]</b></span></a> Around our valiant Captain of the Norm,<br />
							Great son of Sārī, calm and rapt in thought,<br />
							Acclaiming him with clasped hands upraised: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1084"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1084]</b></span></a> 'Hail thou, humanity's aristocrat!<br />
							Glory to thee, 0 thou supremest man!<br />
							Lo! past our thinking are thy ranging thoughts;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1085"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1085]</b></span></a> 0 wondrous are th' Enlightened of the world!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Their intuition, how profoundly deep,<br />
							Beyond the powers to which we testify,<br />
							Though we be skilled as archer splitting hairs!'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1086"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1086]</b></span></a> Then, seeing Sāriputta thus adored<br />
							By hosts divine, saint most adorable,<br />
							A smile stole o'er the face of Kappina.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 ctr"><b>VIII.</b></p>

					<p>The Thera's 'lion's roar' concerning himself:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1087"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1087]</b></span></a> In the whole field of Buddha's following,<br />
							Saving alone the mighty Master's self,<br />
							I stand the foremost in ascetic ways;<br />
							No man doth practise them so far as I.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1088"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1088]</b></span></a> The Master hath my fealty and love,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And all the Buddha's ordinance is done.<br />
							Low have I laid the heavy load I bore,<br />
							Cause for rebirth is found in me no more.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1089"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1089]</b></span></a> For never thought for raiment, nor for food,<br />
							Nor where to rest doth the great mind affect,<br />
							Immeasurable, of our Gotama,<br />
							<a id="pg368"><span class="f2 g"><b>[368]</b></span></a> No more than spotless lotus-blossom takes<br />
							A mark from water;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> to self-sacrifice<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Continually prone, he from the sphere<br />
							Threefold<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> of new becoming is detached.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v1090"><span class="f2 c"><b>[1090]</b></span></a> The neck of him is like the fourfold tower<br />
							Of mindfulness set up; yea, the great Seer<br />
							Hath faith and confidence for hands; above,<br />
							The brow of him is insight; nobly wise,<br />
							He ever walketh in cool blessedness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The legend, in their former and their last lives, of Mahā-Kassapa and his wife (see <i>Sisters,</i> p. 47 ff.), itself fit subject for a poem, is too long to reproduce in full, and is here greatly condensed.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The <i>kareri</i> is called in Childers' Dictionary - I do not know on what authority; it is apparently not in Sanskrit literature - the <i>Capparis trifoliata</i> tree. It gave the name to a pavilion, or <i>manṇḍala-māla,</i> in the Jeta Grove at Sāvatthī (<i>Dialogues,</i> ii. 4; <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#III-8"><i>Udāna,</i> iii. 8</a>). From the expression above, <i>karerimāla-vitatā,</i> I am much tempted to see in the plant the musk rose-tree (<i>Rosa moechata</i>) of Nepal and the North-Western Himalayas, which is still known in some dialects as <i>karer</i>, and is thus described in Dietrich Brandis's <i>Indian Trees</i> (London, 1906): 'A thorny shrub climbing to the tops of lofty trees, flowering branches hanging down in rich festoons. Flowers, white, ... in large compound terminal corymbs. Found at a height of from two to eleven thousand feet. Nearly allied to the <i>Rosa sempervirens</i> of the Mediterranean region.' Could the 'caper' tree be described as making a glade <i>mālāvitatā,</i> 'enwebbed' or 'festooned with wreaths,' as well as a climbing rose?</p>
