					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age in a very poor family, he inclined, as in a previous birth, to feeding on excremeut, and left the world to be a naked ascetic. Practising many austerities, and eating beans one by one on the point of a straw, he was fifty-five years old when the Exalted One, seeing the conditions of arahantship shining within his heart like a lamp in a jar, himself went to him, and teach- <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> ing him the Norm, converted him. Then said he: 'Come, bhikkhu!' thereby ordaining him.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> And Jambuka thereupon conjuring up insight, the Master established him in arahantship. This is in outline, but a full account is given in the Commentary on the Dhammapada verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Bean after bean by point of straw. ...</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>At the hour of his passing away he showed that, though once wrongly living, he, by leaning on the Buddha Supreme, had gotten where a disciple ought to get, thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v283"><span class="f2 c"><b>[283]</b></span></a> For five and fifty years covered with dust<br />
							And dirt, eating a dinner once a month,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And pulling out my hair from head and face,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v284"><span class="f2 c"><b>[284]</b></span></a> On one leg would I stand, I used no couch,<br />
							Dry dung I ate, nor would accept when bid.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v285"><span class="f2 c"><b>[285]</b></span></a> So wrought I actions leading to much woe<br />
							And ruin, swept along by mighty flood,<br />
							Till I a refuge in the Buddha found: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v286"><span class="f2 c"><b>[286]</b></span></a> O see how to that Refuge I am come!<br />
							O see the seemly order of the Norm!<br />
							The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,<br />
							And all the Buddha bids me do is done.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Verse 70 (Commentary, ii. 52-63). The literary reference is of interest, but it does not enable us to say that the <i>Dhammapada Commentary</i> referred to is positively that which we now have in Pali. Jambuka is referred to in <i>Milinda,</i> ii. 249.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The extreme interval given in the list of austerities occurring more than once in <i>Dīgha-Nikāya</i> is twice a month - <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Dialogues,</i> i. 229.</p>
