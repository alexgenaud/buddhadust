					<p>He was born in this Buddha-age at Rājagaha, as the son of a brahmin of great possessions. And when the Master was staying in the Bamboo Grove, Cittaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> went to hear him, and found faith and so entered the Order. Choosing ethical conduct as his exercise, he entered a wooded spot, and there in devotional practice induced jhāna. Thereby developing insight he soon attained arahantship. Thereupon he went to salute the Master. Asked by the brethren, <a id="pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span></a> Have you been strenuous, friend, in your forest sojourn?' be uttered his psalm, to show he had been so, and to declare aññā:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v22"><span class="f2 c"><b>[22]</b></span></a> Peacocks of sapphire neck and comely crest<br />
							Calling, calling in Kāraṅviaa woods;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							By cool and humid winds made musical:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							They wake the thinker from his noonday sleep.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Pronounced Chittāka. Sister Cittā was also of Rājagaha (<i>Sisters,</i> p. 27).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Commentary, reading Karambhiya, states this word is the name of a species of tree, and possibly also the name of the wood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In the compound <i>sītavāta-kalitā</i> the Br. M8. of the Commentary reads <i>kiḷitā,</i> the S. MS. <i>kadditā.</i> In both the word denotes the musical call <i>(madhuravassitaɱ)</i> of the peacock (mora - mayūra). According to the <i>Abhidhānappadīpikū</i> (137), the term <i>kalasaddo</i> is used to designate any inarticulate pleasant sound. The birds are described as crying their <i>ke-kā</i> call when they hear the thunder of the approaching clouds heralding the rains. <i>Mora,</i> a redundant foot, has crept in - from the Commentary perhaps. 'Humid,' the translator's gloss, from <i>meghavātena,</i> 'rain-cloud-breeze,' in the Commentary.</p>
