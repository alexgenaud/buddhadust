					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at <a href="../../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī,</a> as a son of the King of Kosala, and named Brahmadatta, he witnessed the majesty of the Buddha at the Jeta Grove inauguration, entered the Order because he believed, and in due course acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā,</i> together with thorough grasp of the letter and meaning of the Norm.</p>

					<p>One day as he went round for alms, a brahmin abused him. The Thera heard in silence and went on with his business. The brahmin again reviled him, and people commented on the Thera's silence. Whereupon Brahmadatta taught them, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v441"><span class="f2 c"><b>[441]</b></span></a> Whence rises wrath for him who void of wrath<br />
							Holds on 'the even tenor of his way,'<br />
							Self-tamed, serene, by highest insight free?</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v442"><span class="f2 c"><b>[442]</b></span></a> Worse of the two is he who, when reviled,<br />
							<a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> Reviles again. Who doth not, when reviled,<br />
							Revile again, a twofold victory wins.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v443"><span class="f2 c"><b>[443]</b></span></a> Both of the other and himself he seeks<br />
							The good; for he the other's angry mood<br />
							Doth understand and soothe [checking himself].</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v444"><span class="f2 c"><b>[444]</b></span></a> Him who of both is the physician, since<br />
							Himself he healeth and the other too,<br />
							Folk deem a fool, they knowing not the Norm.</p>

					<p>Then the reviling brahmin, hearing these words, was both distressed and glad of heart, and besought the Thera's forgiveness. Yea, he took Orders under him, and was taught the exercise of meditating on love towards others, the Thera thus arming him against obsession by anger:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v445"><span class="f2 c"><b>[445]</b></span></a> If anger rise in thee, then think upon<br />
							The Figure of the Saw; and if arise<br />
							Craving t'indulge thyself, remember thou<br />
							The Parable of how they ate the Child.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v446"><span class="f2 c"><b>[446]</b></span></a> If, lusting for new lives in heaven and earth,<br />
							Thy heart run wild, O check and curb it swift<br />
							By mindfulness, as 'twere the beast men find<br />
							In young corn grazing trespasser, and bind.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
