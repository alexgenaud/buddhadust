					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Sāvatthī in a wealthy family, his heart was moved when the Jeta Grove was presented,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and he left the world. Dwelling in the forest he meditated on ethical conduct, and, because of his attainments and charm, he became called Rāmaṇeyyaka <i>(Gratus, Gratulus)</i>.</p>

					<p>Now one day Māra the Evil One, wishing to disturb him, made a fearful noise. The Thera, hearing it, was with his habitual courage unafraid, and knew it was Māra. And to show his contempt he uttered this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v49"><span class="f2 c"><b>[49]</b></span></a> Not all the clitter-clatter of your noise,<br />
							No more than chirp and squeal of forest sounds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Avail to make pulse throb or mind distraught,<br />
							For one the aim to which my heart is given.</p>

					<p>This verse became the Thera's confession of aññā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The limited range, as yet, of Pali lexicography makes it difficult to follow the Commentary's elucidation of <i>sippika</i>. But that the Thera contemptuously likens Māra's 'fearful noise' to minor forest sounds, such as those emitted by monkeys and squirrels, is obvious. The gāthā, barely stated, ia thus: As to the <i>x y</i> noise and the <i>z</i> sounds, that does not make 'throb my heart, for devotion to unity is mine.'</p>
