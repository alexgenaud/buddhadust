					<p>When our Master had gone to Rājagaha, rolling the excellent wheel of righteousness, Panthaka, the elder son<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg243"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span></a> of a rich councillor's daughter and one of her father's servants, used to go with his grandfather to hear the Master, and so won faith with insight. Entering the Order, he became highly versed in the Buddha-Word, and in the four abstract <i>jhānas,</i> in due time becoming arahant. Dwelling in the bliss of <i>jhāna</i> and of fruition, he was reviewing one day his achievement, and in great joy thereat burst into a 'lion's roar' thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v510"><span class="f2 c"><b>[510]</b></span></a> When first I saw the blessed Master, Him<br />
							For whom no fear can anywhence arise,<br />
							A wave of deep emotion filled my soul<br />
							At sight of Him, the peerless man of men.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v511"><span class="f2 c"><b>[511]</b></span></a> Had a man erst on hands and knees besought<br />
							Favour of Fortune's goddess hither come,<br />
							And won the grace of Master such as this,<br />
							Still might he fail to win [the thing he sought].<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v512"><span class="f2 c"><b>[512]</b></span></a> I for my part [all hindrance] cast away -<br />
							[The hope of] wife and children, coin and corn,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And let my hair and beard be shorn, and forth<br />
							Into the homeless life I went from home.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v513"><span class="f2 c"><b>[513]</b></span></a> The life and training practising, all faculties<br />
							Well held in hand, in loyalty to Him,<br />
							Buddha supreme, master of self I lived.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v514"><span class="f2 c"><b>[514]</b></span></a> Then longing rose within my heart, I yearned<br />
							[To consummate]: 'Now will I no more sit,<br />
							Not even for a moment, while the dart<br />
							Of craving sticketh and is not outdrawn.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v515"><span class="f2 c"><b>[515]</b></span></a> Of me thus aye abiding, O! behold<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And mark the onward stride of energy:<br />
							<a id="pg244"><span class="f2 g"><b>[244]</b></span></a> The Threefold Wisdom have I made my own,<br />
							And all the Buddha bids us do is done.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v516"><span class="f2 c"><b>[516]</b></span></a> I know the where and when of former lives,<br />
							And clearly shines the eye celestial.<br />
							Ar'hant am I, worthy men's offerings.<br />
							Released and without basis for rebirth.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v517"><span class="f2 c"><b>[517]</b></span></a> For as the darkness melted into light,<br />
							And the day broke with rising of the sun,<br />
							From craving, stanched and dry, had come release,<br />
							And on my couch cross-legged I sat in peace.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The untimely birth of the boys when their mother had set out to return to her kinsfolk, their being named 'Roadling' the Greater and the Less, and their going to live with her kinsfolk, is briefly sketched here, but is told more fully in <i>Jāt.,</i> i. 14 <i>ff.,</i> and <i>Aŋguttara Commentary</i> on i. 26.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> 'Unlucky ... fail at the ninth moment' (? eleventh hour), says the Commentary, which sees, moreover, in <i>siriɱ</i> an allusion not to the goddess of luck (<i>Buddhist India</i>, p. 217), but to the <i>sirisayana</i> or <i>cathedra</i> of a teacher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Living as a minor with his grandparents, he had as yet none of these, remarks the Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> For this and following lines, <i>cf.</i> verses 167, '224, 296, 332, 477.</p>
