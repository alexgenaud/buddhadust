					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Pāṭaliputta,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in a brahmin's family, he was named Sobhita. But being a little hunchbacked, he was called Crooked Sobhita. Come of age at the time of the Master's passing away, he was ordained by Ānanda, and acquired sixfold <i>abhiññā.</i></p>

					<p>Now, at the first Great Council in the Sattapaṇṇi Cave, he was bidden fetch Ānanda Thera to the Assembly.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Now at that time the company of devas sent an angel to stand at the entrance to the Cave to counteract the work of Māra. And Khujja-Sobhita announced his own coming to the angel in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v234"><span class="f2 c"><b>[234]</b></span></a> One of the Brethren who in Patna dwell,<br />
							Learned and erudite, lo! at the door,<br />
							Advanced in years, stands Crooked Sobhita.</p>

					<p><a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> Then the angel informed the Saŋgha of the Thera'e advent:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v235"><span class="f2 c"><b>[235]</b></span></a> One of the Brethren who in Patna dwell,<br />
							Learned and eloquent, lo! at the door,<br />
							Advanced in years, he stands borne by the winds.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Then the Saŋgha giving him opportunity, the Thera approached them and confessed <i>aññā:</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v236"><span class="f2 c"><b>[236]</b></span></a> Good fight he made, and made good sacrifice,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							And in the battle won: - now by such war,<br />
							The fervent following of the holy life,<br />
							In happiness he resteth [evermore].</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> For Ānanda's late appearsnco see <i>Vinaya Texts,</i> iii. 373; <i>Vinaya,</i> iii. 259. There, Ānanda's access to the Cave through earth or air, in the commentarial legend, is ascribed to our Thera. Curiously enough, the <i>Vinaya</i> itsolf knows of no Khujja-Sobhita till the Council of Vesālī, a century later (<i>Vinaya Texts,</i> iii. 407). That the Council was held in this Cave is not stated in the <i>Vinaya,</i> which names only the Kalandaka-nivāpa (squirrels' feeding-ground) in the Veḷuvana (Bamboo Grove). 'Angel' is <i>devatā</i> lit., deity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> His aerial return from Ānanda to the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Suyiṭṭhena</i> (which comes more naturally from a lapsed brahmin than the martial epithets) the Commentary explains as 'religious gifts from virtuous friends.' The metre of the poem is disturbed by two glosses <i>samaṇā</i> and <i>dvāre.</i></p>
