					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu in the family of a Sakiyan rāja, he was named Uttiya.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Come to years of discretion, he witnessed the power of the Buddha when the latter came to visit his kin,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> believed in him, and entered the Order. As a student he visited the village one day for alms, and on the way he heard a woman singing, and his concentration gave way, desire and passion arising in him. Checking himself by the power of reflection, he <a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> entered the Vihāra much agitated, and seating himself for siesta-meditation, he so developed insight that he won arahantship. Thereupon he mentioned his release from the ills of rebirth, through disgust at the corruptions, in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v99"><span class="f2 c"><b>[99]</b></span></a> Sound of sweet voice bewildering self-control,<br />
							If one but think upon the image dear,<br />
							The heart inflamed in feeling doth o'erflow<br />
							And clinging stayeth. Thus in him do grow<br />
							The deadly taints that bring <i>Saṅsāra</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> near.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Commentary (Br.) has both Uttiya and Uttariya.</p>

							<p><i>Saṅsāra. Saṅ</i> = on, own, with, one's own; <i>sarati:</i> to go, flow, run, move along. On-flow, own-flow. Another case where the <i>'saṅ'</i> would be well-served by being translated 'own'. The identification with an aspect (a living being) in the on going flow of existence.</p>
