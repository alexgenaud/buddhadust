					<p>Reborn in this Buddha-age at Kapilavatthu, as the son of Rāja Suddhodana and of Great Pajāpatī,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and a joy to his kin, on his naming day he was named Nanda. When Nanda was of age, the Master, rolling the Wheel of the Norm, came out of compassion to Kapilavatthu. Making a shower of rain the occasion, he told the <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/jat/jat.6/jat.6.547.cowl.pts.htm">Vessantara Jātaka.</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> On the second day, by the verse 'Rise up,' he established his father as a Stream-winner; Pajāpatī also by the verse, 'Follow after a holy life,' and the <i>rāja</i> further, as a Once-returner. On the third day, when seeking alms at the coronation-hall where congratulations were being offered to Prince Nanda on his wedding, the Master handed the prince his bowl and wished him luck. And he, taking the bowl, followed the Master to the Vihara, who there ordained him, though Nanda wished it not.</p>

					<p><a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> From that time, knowing that Nanda was oppressed by his distaste, the Master trained it away, so that Nanda, by thoroughgoing meditation, established insight and attained arahantship. Thereafter, enjoying the bliss of liberty, be said: '0 excellent method of the Master, whereby I was drawn out of the bog of rebirth and set on Nibbāna's strand!' And joying in his reflections he uttered these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v157"><span class="f2 c"><b>[157]</b></span></a> Heedless and shallow once my thoughts were set<br />
							On all the bravery of outward show;<br />
							Fickle was I and frivolous; all my days<br />
							Were worn with wanton sensuality.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v158"><span class="f2 c"><b>[158]</b></span></a> But by the Buddha's skilful art benign,<br />
							Who of sun's lineage cometh, was I brought<br />
							To live by deeper thought, whereby my heart<br />
							From (the great swamp of endless) life<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> I drew.</p>

					<p>And the Exalted One, discerning how eminently he was trained in self-control, declared him before the Order to be chief therein among his disciples,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> even therein conferring that distinction to which the Thera, in past ages, had once aspired.</p>
