					<p>Reborn in the time of our Exalted One at <i>Sāvatthī</i> in a clansman's family, he was called Nandaka. He entered the Order after hearing the Master teach the Norm, and developing insight won arahantship. Thereafter, while dwelling in the bliss of emancipation, he gave a lesson by the Master's order one feast-day to the bhikkhunīs, and caused 500 of them to attain arahantship. Wherefore the Exalted One ranked him foremost among the exhorters of the brethren and sisters.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>Now, one day, while seeking alms in Sāvatthī, a woman, to whom he had been married, saw him and laughed with <a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> sinful heart. The Thera, seeing her action, taught her the Norm under the aspect of emphasizing repugnance at the body,thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v279"><span class="f2 c"><b>[279]</b></span></a> Fie on the fulsome thing malodorous!<br />
							A very tool of Mara, even this,<br />
							Thy body, whence exude those many streams,<br />
							In number nine, that never cease their flow.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v280"><span class="f2 c"><b>[280]</b></span></a> Build no conceits from former passages.<br />
							Try not to allure the Elect-who-Thus-have-Come¡<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							The very heavens delight them not, how then<br />
							Should aught that's merely earthly ever please?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v281"><span class="f2 c"><b>[281]</b></span></a> The fools who lack discretion, they whose mind<br />
							Is sullied, and their heart by dullness cloaked,<br />
							Such men in charms of body take delight,<br />
							For they are fast in bonds by Mara thrown.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v282"><span class="f2 c"><b>[282]</b></span></a> To them who are untouched by lust, or hate,<br />
							Or ignorance, these things no pleasures be.<br />
							Cut are the cords; they from all bonds are free.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Tathāgate,</i> made here by the Commentary to include all Buddha-savakas, or Ariya-savakas, who have 'come' with the conditions for saintship, or have attained the highest, are <i>avabuddhā.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> I do not here follow Dr. Neumann's syntax. The woman's power to please humans was a source of danger. She was only incapable of moving <i>Tathāgatas,</i> or saints, who have won ineffable pleasures.</p>
