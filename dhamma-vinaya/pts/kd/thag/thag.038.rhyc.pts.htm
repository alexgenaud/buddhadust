					<p>He was reborn in this Buddha-age as one of the four lay-companions of the Thera Yasa, who, when they heard of Yasa's renunciation, imitated him, and also won arahantship.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Thereafter he dwelt in the Añjana Grove at <a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> Sāketa, experiencing the bliss of emancipation. Now at that time the Exalted One came also with a great company of bhikkhus to the Añjana Grove, and the accommodation was insufficient, many of the bhikkhus sleeping around the vihāra on the sandbanks of the River Sarabhū.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Then in the middle of the night the stream rose in flood, and a great cry arose from the younger brethren. The Exalted One hearing it, sent for the venerable Gavampati, and said: 'Go, Gavampati, arrest the rising stream, and put the bhikkhus at ease.' And the Thera by his mystic power did so, and stopped the stream afar so that it stood up like a mountain-peak. Thenceforth the might of the Thera became known. One day as the Master sat teaching in the midst of a great assembly he saw Gavampati, and in compassion for the world praised his virtues in this verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v38"><span class="f2 c"><b>[38]</b></span></a> Who by his might<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> reared up the Sarabhū,<br />
							Who standeth self-reliant and unmoved,<br />
							Who hath transcended every tie, Gavampati,<br />
							Him mighty seer the very gods acclaim,<br />
							Surpasser of the coming back to be.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The present city of Ayodhyā stands on a corner of the site of what was once the great city, 24 miles in circumference, of Sāketa, about 100 miles north-north-east of Benares. The Sarabhū or Sarayū flows through it into the Gharghara, a tributary of the Ganges. Cf. XXVIII.</p>
