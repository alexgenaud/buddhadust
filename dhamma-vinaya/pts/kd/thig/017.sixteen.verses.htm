					<p>S<span class="f2">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was, when Vipassi was Buddha, reborn in a clansman's family. Come to years of discretion, because of the promise that was in her, she waxed anxious at the prospect of rebirth, and, going to the Bhikkhunīs, heard the Norm, believed, and entered the Order. Perfect in virtue, and learning the Three Pitakas, she became very learned in the Norm, and a teacher of it. The same destiny befell her under the five succeeding Buddhas — Sikhi, Vessabhu, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, and Kassapa. But because of her tendency to pride, she was unable to root out the defilements.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> So it came to pass, through the karma of her pride, that, in this Buddha-era, she was <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> reborn at Sāvatthī, in the household of Anāthapiṇḍika, the Treasurer, of a domestic slave. She became a Stream-entrant after hearing the discourse of the Lion's Roar.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Afterwards, when she had converted (lit. tamed) the baptist<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> brahmin, and so won her master's esteem that he made her a freed woman, she obtained his consent, as her guardian and head of her home, to enter the Order. And, practising insight, she in no long time won Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. Reflecting on her attainment, she uttered these verses in exultation:</p>

							Harassed by fear of blame from mistresses.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v237"><span class="f2 c"><b>[237]</b></span></a> 'What, brahmin, fearest thou that ever thus<br />
							Thou goest down into the river? Why<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v238"><span class="f2 c"><b>[238]</b></span></a> 'Well know'st thou, damsel Puṇṇikā, why ask<br />

							Effect of evil karma? Who in youth,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v239"><span class="f2 c"><b>[239]</b></span></a> Or age ill deeds hath wrought, by baptism<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v241"><span class="f2 c"><b>[241]</b></span></a> Why then the fishes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> and the tortoises,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v242"><span class="f2 c"><b>[242]</b></span></a> Will go. Yea, all who evil karma work —<br />
							Butchers of sheep and swine, hunters of game,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v250"><span class="f2 c"><b>[250]</b></span></a> 'Lo! to the Buddha I for refuge go,<br />

					<p>For the brahmin, established in the Refuges and the Precepts, when later he had heard the Master preach the Norm, became a believer and entered the Order. Using every effort, he not long after became Thrice-Wise,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> and, reflecting on his state, exulted in those verses. And the Sister, repeating them of herself, they all became her Psalm.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Commentary gives her the latter name, of which the former is the diminutive. Possibly Puṇṇikā may have been used to distinguish her from the Therī Puṇṇā of <a href="006.single.verses.htm#III">Ps. iii.</a> It is curious that in the Subhā-Sutta of the <i>Majjhima Nikaya,</i> where young brahmins come to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's gift, to interview the Buddha, a slave-girl Puṇṇikā is alluded to in the conversation. Subhā says: 'They [certain brahmin teachers] are not able to read the thoughts of slave-girl Puṇṇikā. How should they be able to know the minds of all recluses?' If this is our Puṇṇikā, she would not yet be a Therī, or she would be referred to as such.</p>
