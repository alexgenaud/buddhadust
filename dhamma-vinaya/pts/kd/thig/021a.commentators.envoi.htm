					      <p class="f4 in2">The Psalms of them who through the Gospel's grace<br />
							Became the true-born children and the heirs,<br />
							Mouth-born, of Him who is the Master Blest,<br />
							King o' the Norm, creations of the Norm,<br />
							Excelling in all virtue, Arahants,<br />
							Who wrought all that 'twas possible to do — <br />
							These Psalms, their utterances when añña<br />
							They did proclaim, or whensoe'er it was,<br />
							Beginning with Brother S<span class="f2">UBH&#x016A;TI'S</span> verse,<br />
							With Sisters Psalms, headed by 'S<span class="f2">TURDYKIN</span>' — <br />
							All these the Leaders of the Order took,<br />
							And in one ordered serial compiled,<br />
							The T<span class="f2">HERAGĀTHĀ-T<span class="f2">HERīGĀTHĀĀ</span></span> named.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">To elucidate the import of that work<br />
							Three Older Commentaries are extant.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Thereto this exegesis I have tried<br />
							T' indite, the which, in that where'er 'twas fit,<br />
							I strove to set the highest meaning forth,<br />
							<a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> I named the Paramattha-Dipani;<br />
							The whole whereof, now finished to the end,<br />
							By orderly decision is arranged,<br />
							For recitation from the sacred text,<br />
							In chapters of the number ninety-two.<br />
							Thus by the efficacy of such good<br />
							As has accrued to me, by me applied,<br />
							Have I made bright the glory of the word,<br />
							The system, of the Sovran of the world;<br />
							That, by their pure attainment in all truth<br />
							And virtue, mortals all may come to taste<br />
							The essence of emancipation won.<br />
							Long may the Very Buddha's Word and Law<br />
							Abide, and ever may it be revered<br />
							By every creature that hath life and breath!<br />
							And may the weather-god in season due<br />
							Send rain on earth, and may the powers that be<br />
							Govern the world as lovers of the Norm!</p>

					<p>Thus endeth the Commentary on the Therīgatha, by the Teacher, Brother Dhammapala, residing at the Padara-Tittha-Vihāra.</p>
