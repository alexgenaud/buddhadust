					<p>S<span class="f2">HE</span> too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and persisting in her former disposition in this and that rebirth, in that she heaped up good of age-enduring efficacy, in the seventh rebirth before her last phase of life, susceptible to sex-attraction, wrought adulterous conduct. For this she did purgatory for many centuries, and thereafter for three rebirths was an animal. Thereafter she was brought forth by a slave-woman as an hermaphrodite, and thereafter she was born as the daughter of a poor common man, and was, when of age, married to the son of a caravan-leader named Giridāsa. Now the wife that he had was virtuous and of noble qualities, and the new wife envied her, and quarrelled with the husband because of her. After her death she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Ujjenī<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> as the daughter of a virtuous, honoured and wealthy merchant, and was named Isidasī.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> When she was of age, her parents gave her in marriage to a merchant's son, a good match with herself. For a month she dwelt with him as a devoted wife; then, as the fruit of her previous actions, her husband became estranged from her, and turned her out of his house. All this is told in the Pali text. Because she had not proved desirable for one husband after another, <a id="pg157"><span class="f2 g"><b>[157]</b></span></a> she grew agitated and, gaining her father's consent, took orders under the Therī Jinadattā. And studying for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and meaning.</p>

					<p>Dwelling in the bliss of fruition and Nibbāna, she one day, after seeking her meal in the city of Patna and dining, sat down on a sandbank of great Ganges, and being asked by her companion, the Therī Bodhi, about her previous experience, she related it by way of verses. And to show the connection of her former and latter replies, these three stanzas were inserted by the Recensionists:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v400"><span class="f2 c"><b>[400]</b></span></a> In the fair city of Patna, earth's fairest city,<br />
							Named for its beauty after the Trumpet-flower,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Dwelt two saintly Sisters, born of the Sākiyas,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v401"><span class="f2 c"><b>[401]</b></span></a> Isidāsī the one, Bodhi the other.<br />
							Precept-observers, lovers of Jhana-rapture,<br />
							Learn&egrave;d ladies and cleansed from the taint of all worldliness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v402"><span class="f2 c"><b>[402]</b></span></a> These having made their round, and broken their fasting,<br />
							Washed their bowls, and sitting in happy seclusion,<br />
							Spake thus one to the other, asking and answering:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v403"><span class="f2 c"><b>[403]</b></span></a> 'Thou hast a lovely mien, Isidāsī,<br />
							Fresh and unwithered yet thy woman's prime,<br />
							What flaw in the life yonder hast thou seen,<br />
							That thou didst choose surrender for thy lot?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v404"><span class="f2 c"><b>[404]</b></span></a> Then in that quiet spot Isidāsī,<br />
							Skilled in the exposition of the Norm,<br />
							<a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> Took up her tale and thus did make reply:<br />
							'Hear, Bodhi, how it was that I came forth.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v407"><span class="f2 c"><b>[407]</b></span></a> My salutation morn and eve I brought<br />
							To both the parents of my husband, low<br />
							Bowing my head and kneeling at their feet,<br />
							According to the training given me.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v408"><span class="f2 c"><b>[408]</b></span></a> My husband's sisters and his brothers too,<br />
							And all his kin, scarce were they entered when<br />
							I rose in timid zeal and gave them place.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v409"><span class="f2 c"><b>[409]</b></span></a> And as to food, or boiled or dried, and drink,<br />
							That which was to be stored I set aside,<br />
							And served it out and gave to whom 'twas due.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v410"><span class="f2 c"><b>[410]</b></span></a> Rising betimes, I went about the house,<br />
							Then with my hands and feet well cleansed I went<br />
							To bring respectful greeting to my lord,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v411"><span class="f2 c"><b>[411]</b></span></a> And taking comb and mirror, unguents, soap,<br />
							I dressed and groomed him as a handmaid might.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v412"><span class="f2 c"><b>[412]</b></span></a> <i>I</i> boiled the rice, <i>I</i> washed the pots and pans;<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v414"><span class="f2 c"><b>[414]</b></span></a> Nay, to his mother and his father he<br />
							Thus spake: — 'Give ye me leave and I will go,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v415"><span class="f2 c"><b>[415]</b></span></a> 'O son, speak not on this wise of thy wife,<br />
							For wise is Isidāsī and discreet,<br />

							Say, doth she find no favour in thine eyes?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v416"><span class="f2 c"><b>[416]</b></span></a> 'In nothing doth she work me harm, and yet<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v417"><span class="f2 c"><b>[417]</b></span></a> And when they heard, mother and father-in-law<br />
							Asked of me: 'What then hast thou done t' offend?<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v418"><span class="f2 c"><b>[418]</b></span></a> 'Naught have I done that could offend, nor harm,<br />

							That me my husband should so sore mislike?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v419"><span class="f2 c"><b>[419]</b></span></a> To guard and keep their son, they took me back,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v421"><span class="f2 c"><b>[421]</b></span></a> From that house too, when I had dwelt a month,<br />

							Come, throw away that ragged robe and pot!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v423"><span class="f2 c"><b>[423]</b></span></a> He came, and so we dwelt one half moon more<br />
							Together. Then to father thus he spake:<br />
							'O give me back my frock, my bowl and cup.<br />
							Let me away to seek once more my scraps.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v424"><span class="f2 c"><b>[424]</b></span></a> Then to him father, mother, all the tribe<br />
							Of kinsfolk clamouring: 'What is it then<br />
							Here dwelling likes you not? Say quick, what is't<br />
							That we can do to make you better pleased?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v425"><span class="f2 c"><b>[425]</b></span></a> Then he: 'If for myself I can suffice,<br />
							Enough for me. One thing I know: — beneath<br />
							One roof with Isidāsī I'll not live!'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v426"><span class="f2 c"><b>[426]</b></span></a> Dismissed he went. I too, alone I thought.<br />
							And then I asked my parents' leave to die,<br />
							Or, that they suffer me to leave the world.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v427"><span class="f2 c"><b>[427]</b></span></a> Now Lady Jinadatta on her beat<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v429"><span class="f2 c"><b>[429]</b></span></a> And water — dishes we had set aside —<br />

							'Lady, I wish to leave the world.' 'Why here,'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v430"><span class="f2 c"><b>[430]</b></span></a> My father said, 'dear child, is scope for thee<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v432"><span class="f2 c"><b>[432]</b></span></a> Then father said: 'Win thou Enlightenment<br />

							Found rebirth in the body of an ape.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v440"><span class="f2 c"><b>[440]</b></span></a> Therefrom deceasing, I again found birth,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v441"><span class="f2 c"><b>[441]</b></span></a> Castrated, yoked, I drew the plough and cart,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v442"><span class="f2 c"><b>[442]</b></span></a> Therefrom deceasing, even in the street<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The Commentator interprets the Vedic infinitive <i>kātuye,</i> 'do,' as meaning <i>kātu'yye,</i> 'do, lady.'</p>

Commentary: 'Defeated by the goddess Siri (&#x015A;rī) clad in human dress' — <i>i.e.,</i> Isidāsī, as personating the fickle goddess of chance. Thus they call her 'Luck!'

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> To ripen or be cooked is the usual metaphor for a cause working out its effect. Note that 'hell' here (<i>niraya</i>) is really purgatory. No form of being, for Buddhism, was eternal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> I have discussed this passage in 'Early Economic Conditions in North India' (<i>J.R.A.S.,</i> 1901, 880, <i>n.</i> 1) thus: In the second line, which Dr. Neumann renders 'Vom Tische Reicher lasen wir die Reste auf,' I take the compound <i>dhanikapurisapātabahulamhi</i> (Commentary: <i>iṇāyikānaṅ purisānaṅ adhipatanabahule bahūhi iṇāyikehi abhibhavitabbe</i>) to mean 'fallen into the power of usurers.'

					I am unable to classify the metre throughout this poem, from the
