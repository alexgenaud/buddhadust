She too could not gain self-mastery for twenty-five years, till in her old age she heard a timely sermon, through which her insight expanded and she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereon reflecting, she broke forth:</p>

					<p>She, too, heaping up good under former Buddhas, was in the time of Vipassi Buddha, born at Bandhumatī, in the house of a certain wealthy landowner, and became a domestic servant. Grown up, she tended her master's household. Now, at that time, King Bandhuma (Vipassi's father), having restored Sabbath-keeping, gave gifts before dining and, after dining, attended a sermon; and the people, following his pious example, and keeping Sabbath, the slave thought: 'Why should not I, too, do as they all are doing?' And for the thoroughness of her observance of the feasts she was reborn among the Three-and-Thirty gods, and in other happy realms, and finally, in this Buddha-era, in the house of the Treasurer of Sāvatthī. Come to years of discretion, she heard Paṭācārā preach, and entered the Order; but she was unable to attain the climax of insight till Paṭācārā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> seeing the state of her mind, gave her admonition. <a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> Thereby established, she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. And reflecting thereon, she exulted thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v42"><span class="f2 c"><b>[42]</b></span></a> Four times, nay, five, I sallied from my cell,<br />
							And roamed afield to find the peace of mind<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v44"><span class="f2 c"><b>[44]</b></span></a> And well I minded all, e'en as she taught.<br />

					<p>She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, was born, in the time of Vipassi Buddha, as a domestic servant, at Bandhumatī. One day, seeing an Arahant of the Master's Order seeking alms, she gladly offered him three sweet cakes. Through this reborn to happiness, she finally came to birth, in this Buddha-era, in <a id="pg37"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></a> the family of an eminent brahmin in the country of Kosala. Come to years of discretion, she heard the Master preach while touring in the country, and leaving the world, she soon won Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.

					<p>She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and in this and that rebirth heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy, was born, when the world was empty of a Buddha, as a fairy by the River Candabhaga.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> Sporting one day with the fairies, and straying awhile, she saw a silent <a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> Buddha seated at the foot of a tree, and adored him in faith with flower-offerings. For this she was reborn among gods and men, and, finally, in this Buddha-era, at Sāvatthī, in the house of the King's chaplain-brahmin. Come to years of discretion, she became a lay-believer in the Jeta Grove [College], and, later, entered the Order under Great Pajāpatī  the Gotamid. And one day, while staying at Rājagaha, she ascended the Vulture's Peak, after her meal, and while resting, she saw that which she tells of in her verse, whereby she won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. And afterwards, thrilled with happiness at the thought of her attainment, she exulted thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v48"><span class="f2 c"><b>[48]</b></span></a> Coming from noonday-rest on Vulture's Peak,<br />

					<p>She too, having made her resolve in the time of former Buddhas, and heaping up, in this and that rebirth, good, valid for an æon of evolution, was born, in the time of <a id="pg39"><span class="f2 g"><b>[39]</b></span></a> Padumuttara Buddha, at the town of Haŋsavatī in a clansman's house. Come to years of discretion, she was left alone one day, her parents being engaged with a party in the inner court of the house. And seeing an Arahant approaching the house-door, she bade him 'Come in hither, lord,' and did him homage, showing him to a seat; she then took his bowl and filled it with food. The Elder thanked her, and departed. But she, reborn therefore in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty gods, enjoying there a heavenly time and many a happy life thereafter, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī in the family of a very eminent burgess. And she was beautiful to see, and was brought into the house of the King of Kosala himself.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> After a few years a daughter was born to her, whom she named Jīvā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>  The King saw the child, and was so pleased that he had Ubbirī anointed as Queen. But anon the little girl died, and the mother went daily mourning to the charnel-field. And one day she went and worshipped the Master, and sat down; but soon she left, and stood lamenting by the River Achiravati. Then the Master, seeing her from afar, revealed himself, and asked her: 'Why dost thou weep?' 'I weep because of my daughter, Exalted One.' 'Burnt in this cemetery are some 84,000<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> of thy daughters. For which of them dost thou weep?' And pointing out the place where this one and that one had been laid, he said half the psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v51"><span class="f2 c"><b>[51]</b></span></a> O Ubbirī, who wailest in the wood,<br />
							Crying 'O Jīvā! O my daughter dear!'<br />
							Come to thyself! Lo, in this burying-ground<br />
							Are burnt full many a thousand daughters dear,<br />
							And all of them were named like unto her.<br />
							Now which of all those Jīvās dost thou mourn?</p>

					<p><a id="pg40"><span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></a> And she pondered with intelligence on the Norm thus taught by the Master, and so stirred up insight that, by the charm of his teaching and her own attainment of the requisite conditions, she reached the topmost fruit, even Arahantship.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> And showing forth the high distinction she had won, she spoke the second half of the psalm:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v52"><span class="f2 c"><b>[52]</b></span></a> Lo! from my heart the hidden shaft is gone!<br />
							The shaft that nestled there hath he removed.<br />
							And that consuming grief for my dead child<br />
							Which poisoned all the life of me is dead.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v53"><span class="f2 c"><b>[53]</b></span></a> To-day my heart is healed, my yearning stayed,<br />
							And all within is purity and peace.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p>She, too, having fared in the past as the foregoing Sisters, was born in a clansman's house.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> Come to years of discretion, she went with lay-women disciples to the Vihāra,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span> and heard the Master preach. Becoming a believer, she left the world and became learned, proficient in the doctrine, and a ready speaker. Leading for cen- <a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> turies a religious life,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> she yet died a worldling at heart, and was reborn in the heaven of bliss.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> Again, when Vipassi was Buddha, and again when Vessabhu was Buddha, she kept the precepts, and was learned and proficient in doctrine. Again, when Kakusandha was Buddha, and yet again when Konāgamana was Buddha, she took Orders, and was pure in conduct, learn&egrave;d, and a preacher. At length, she was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Rājagaha, in the family of an eminent burgess, and called Sukkā (bright, lustrous, 'Lucy'). Come to years of discretion, she found faith in the Master at her own home, and became a lay-disciple. But later, when she heard Dhammadinnā preach,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> she was thrilled with emotion, and renounced the world under her. And performing the exercises for insight, she not long after attained Arahantship, together with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning.</p>

					<p>Thereupon, attended by 500 Bhikkhunīs, she became a great preacher. And one day, when they had been into Rājagaha for alms, and had returned and dined, they entered the Bhikkhunī's, settlement, and Sukkā, with a great company seated around her, taught the doctrine in such wise that she seemed to be giving them sweet mead to drink and sprinkling them with ambrosia. And they all listened to her rapt, motionless, intent. Thereupon the spirit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> of the tree that stood at the end of the Sisters' terrace was inspired by her teaching, and went out to Rājagaha, walking about the ways and the squares proclaiming her excellence, and saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v54"><span class="f2 c"><b>[54]</b></span></a> What would ye men of Rājagahahave?<br />
							What have ye done? that mute and idle here<br />
							<a id="pg42"><span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span></a> Ye lie about, as if bemused with wine,<br />
							Nor wait upon Sukkā, while she reveals<br />
							The precious gospel by the Buddha taught.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v55"><span class="f2 c"><b>[55]</b></span></a> The wise in heart, methinks, were fain to quaff<br />
							That life's elixir, once won never lost,<br />
							That welleth ever up in her sweet words,<br />
							E'en as the wayfarer welcomes the rain.</p>

					<p>And hearing what the tree-spirit said, the people were excited, and came to the Sister and listened attentively.</p>

					<p>At a later period, when the Sister, at the end of her life, was completing her Nibbāna, and wished to show how the system she had taught led to salvation, she declared her añña thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v56"><span class="f2 c"><b>[56]</b></span></a> O Child of light!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> by light of truth set free<br />
							From cravings dire, firm, self-possessed, serene,<br />

With him she lived happily till his death. Then, being herself advanced in years, and growing anxious as she sought to find Good,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span> she went about from park to park,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> from vihāra to vihāra, with the intention of teaching <a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> religion (<i>dhamma</i>) to votaries of religion. Then one day she came up to the Bo-tree of the Master<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> and sat down, thinking: 'If a Buddha, an Exalted One, be unequalled and peerless among men, may this one show me the miracle of Buddhahood.' Scarce had the thought arisen when the Tree blazed forth, the branches appeared as if made of gold, the horizon shone all around. And she, inspired at that sight, fell down and worshipped, and for seven days sat there. On the seventh day she performed a grand feast of offering and worship to the Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> By this meritorious karma she was reborn in this Buddha-era, in the kingdom of Āḷavī, as the King's daughter, and named Selā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> But she was also known as 'The Āḷavīkan.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> Come to years of discretion, the Master converted her father, ordained him, and went with him to the city of Āḷavī. Selā, being yet unmarried, went with the King and heard the Master preach. She became a believer and a lay-disciple. Afterwards, growing anxious, she took Orders, worked her way to insight, and because of the promise in her and the maturity of her knowledge, she, crushing the formations of thought, word and deed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> soon won Arahantship.</p>

					<p>Thereafter, as an Elder, she lived at Sāvatthī. And one day she went forth from Sāvatthī to take siesta in the Dark Grove, and sat down beneath a tree. Then Māra, alone and wishing to interrupt her privacy, approached in the guise of a stranger, saying:</p>

					<p>Then the Sister — thinking: 'Verily, 'tis that foolish Māra who would deny me the Nibbāna that is revealed to me, and bids me choose the sensuous life. He knows not that I am an Arahant. Now will I tell him and confound him' —  recited the following:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span></p>

And later on, growing anxious, she entered the Order of Bhikkhunīs, and, working her way to insight, she not long after won Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in letter and in spirit.</p>

					<p>Then, dwelling at Sāvatthī in the bliss of emancipation, she went forth one day to take siesta in the Dark Grove, and sat down beneath a tree. And Māra, alone, and wishing to interrupt her privacy, approached her, invisible and in the air, saying:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v60"><span class="f2 c"><b>[60]</b></span></a> That vantage-ground the sages may attain is hard<br />
							To reach. With her two-finger consciousness<br />
							<i>That</i> is no woman competent to gain!</p>

					<p>For women, from the age of seven or eight, boiling rice at all times, know not the moment when the rice is cooked, but must take some grains in a spoon and press it with two fingers; hence the expression 'two-finger' sense.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> Then the Elder rebuked Māra:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v61"><span class="f2 c"><b>[61]</b></span></a> How should the woman's nature hinder us?<br />
							Whose hearts are firmly set, who ever move<br />
							With growing knowledge onward in the Path?<br />
							What can that signify to one in whom<br />
							Insight doth truly comprehend the Norm?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> <a href="008.three.verses.htm#v45-4"><sup>183</sup></a></p>

							And the thick gloom of ignorance is rent<br />
