					<p>T<span class="f2">HUS</span> have I heard. The Exalted One was once staying at Sāvatthī , in the Jeta Grove, the park of Anathapi.n.dika. Now Āḷavīka the Bhikkhunī dressed herself early and, taking bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for food. And when she had gone about Sāvatthī for it, had broken her fast and returned, she entered the Dark Wood, seeking solitude.</p>

					<p>Then Māra the Evil One, desiring to arouse fear, wavering, and dread in her, desiring to make her desist from being alone, went up to her, and addressed her in a verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Ne'er shalt thou find escape while in the world.<br />
							What profiteth thee then thy loneliness?<br />
							Take the good things of life while yet thou may'st,<br />
							Repentance else too late awaiteth thee.'</p>

					<p>Then Āḷavīka thought: 'Who now is this, human or non-human, that speaketh this verse? Sure 'tis Māra the Evil One speaketh it, desirous to arouse in me fear, wavering and dread, desirous to make me desist from my solitude.' And Bhikkhunī Āḷavīka, knowing that 'twas he, replied with a verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg181"><span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span></a> 'There is escape while in the world, and I<br />
							Have well attained thereto by insight won.<br />
							Thou evil limb of loafing!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> 'tis not thine<br />
							To know that bourne, or how it may be reached.<br />
							Like spears and jav'lins are the joys of sense,<br />
							That pierce and rend the mortal frames of us.<br />
							These that thou callest "the good things of life,"<br />
							Good of that ilk to me is nothing worth.'</p>

					<p>Then Māra, thinking, 'Bhikkhunī Āḷavīka knows me!' vanished thence, sad and dejected.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'That vantage-ground the sages may attain is hard<br />
							To reach. With her two-finger consciousness<br />
							That is no woman competent to gain!'</p>

					<p>Then Soma thought ... 'Sure 'tis Māra!' ... and replied with verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'What should the woman's nature do to them<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />

							Am I a man, or what not am I, then?<br />

					<p>Now the Lean Gotamid ... entered the Dark Wood for siesta, and, plunging into its depths, sat down at the root of a certain tree for siesta. Then Māra ... went up to her, and addressed her in a verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'How now? Dost sit alone with tearful face<br />
							As mother stricken by the loss of child?<br />
							Thou who hast plunged into the woods alone,<br />

					<p>Then Bhikkhunī Vijaya thought ... 'Sure 'tis Māra!' ... and ... replied with verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Sights, sounds and tastes and smells and things to touch,<br />
							Wherein the mind delights, I leave them all<br />

							<a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> Doth touch me only with distress and shame.<br />

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="A-5">5. Uppalavaṇṇa.</a></h4>

					<p>Now, Bhikkhunī Uppalavaṇṇa. ... . . 	entered the Dark Wood for siesta, and, plunging into its depths, halted at the root of a certain sala-tree in full blossom.</p>

					<p>Then Māra ... addressed her in a verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Thou that art come where over thee crown&egrave;d with blossom<br />

							In sooth, good sir, no fear have I of thee!'</p>

					<p>Now, Bhikkhunī Cala ... sat down at the root of a certain tree for siesta.</p>

					<p>Then Māra the Evil One went up to her, and spoke thus to her: 'Wherein, O Sister, dost thou find no pleasure?'</p>

					<p>'In birth,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> good sir, I find no pleasure.'</p>

					<p>'Why findest thou no pleasure in birth? Once born, one enjoys the pleasures of a life of sense. Who hath put this into thy mind — "Find no pleasure in birth" — Sister?'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Once born, we die. Once born, we see life's Ills —<br />

					<p class="f4">'Nowhere, good sir, I wish to rise again.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Now, think upon the Three-and-Thirty gods,<br />

					<p>Now, Bhikkhunī Sisupacalā ... sat down at the root of a certain tree for siesta.</p>

					<p>Then Māra the Evil One went up to her, and spoke to her thus: 'Of whose shibboleth, Sister, dost thou approve?' 'I approve of no one's shibboleth, good sir.'</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Why now and whereto art thou seen thus garbed<br />

					<p>In the following Sutta presumably the same devoted spirit proclaims the praises both of Sukkā and of a lay-disciple who supplied the eloquent Therī with food:</p>
