					<p>S<span class="f2">HE</span>, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, so that in her the root of good (karma) was well planted, and the requisites for emancipation were well stored up, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn at Sāvatthī, in a certain clansman's family, and called Uttarā. Come to years of discretion, she heard Pa&#x1E6D;ācārā preach the Norm, became thereby a believer, entered the Order, and became an Arahant. And, reflecting on her attainment, she exulted thus:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v175"><span class="f2 c"><b>[175]</b></span></a> 'Men in their prime, with pestle and with quern<br />
							Are busied pounding rice and grinding corn.<br />
							Men in their prime gather and heap up wealth,<br />
							To have and nourish wife and children dear.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v176"><span class="f2 c"><b>[176]</b></span></a> Yours is the task to spend yourselves upon<br />
							The Buddha's will which bringeth no remorse.<br />
							Swiftly bathe ye your feet, then sit ye down</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v177"><span class="f2 c"><b>[177]</b></span></a> Apart. Planting your minds in Steadfastness,<br />
							With concentrated effort well composed,<br />
							Ponder how what ye do, and say, and think,<br />
							Proceeds not from a Self, is not your Self.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> <a id="v178"><span class="f2 c"><b>[178]</b></span></a> The will of her who spake — Pa&#x1E6D;ācārā —<br />
							I heard and marked and forthwith carried out.<br />
							Bathing my feet, I sat me down apart.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v179"><span class="f2 c"><b>[179]</b></span></a> While passed the first watch of the night there rose<br />
							Long memories of the bygone line of lives.<br />
							While passed the second watch, the Heavenly Eye,<br />
							Purview celestial, I clarified.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v180"><span class="f2 c"><b>[180]</b></span></a> While passed the third watch of the night, I burst<br />
							And rent aside the gloom of ignorance.<br />
							Now rich in Threefold Wisdom I arose:<br />
							'O Lady! verily thy will is done.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v181"><span class="f2 c"><b>[181]</b></span></a> And like to Sakka o'er the thrice ten gods,<br />
							Chiefain unconquered in celestial wars,<br />
							I place thee as my chief, and so shall live.<br />
							The Threefold Wisdom have I gotten now.<br />
							From deadly drugs my soul is purified.'</p>

					<p>Now this Sister, one day, when under Pa&#x1E6D;ācārā she had established herself in an exercise, went into her own dwelling, and seating herself cross-legged, thought: 'I will not break up this sitting until I have emancipated my heart from all dependence on the &#x0100;savas.' Thus resolving, she incited her intellectual grasp, and gradually clarifying insight as she progressed along the Paths, she attained Arahantship, together with the power of intuition and thorough grasp of the Norm. Thus contemplating nineteen subjects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in succession, with the consciousness that 'Now have I done what herein I had to do,' she uttered in her happiness the verses given above, and stretched her limbs. And when the dawn arose, and night brightened into day, she sought the Therī's presence, and repeated her verses.</p>

					<p>She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficac in subsequent rebirths, was, in this Buddha-era, reborn in Magadha, at the village of Nālaka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> the child of Surūpasārī, the Brahminee. And on her name-giving day they called her Cālā.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> Her younger sister was Upacālā, and the youngest Sīsūpacālā, and all three were junior to their brother Sāriputta, Captain of the Norm. Now, when the three heard that their brother had left the world for the Order, they said: 'This can be no ordinary system, nor ordinary renunciation, if one like our brother have followed it!' And full of desire and longing, they too renounced the world, putting aside their weeping kinsfolk and attendants. Thereupon, with striving and endeavour, they attained Arahantship, and abode in the bliss of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p>Now, Cālā Bhikkhunī, after her round and her meal, entered one day the Dark Grove to take siesta. Then Māra came to stir up sensual desires in her. Is it not told in the Sutta?</p>

					<p>Again, Cālā Bhikkhunī, after her round in Sāvatthi and her meal, entered one day the Pleasant Grove for siesta. And, going on down into the Dark Grove, she sat down under a tree. Then Māra came, and, wishing to upset the consistency of her religious life, asked her the questions in her Psalm. When she had expounded to him the virtues of the Master, and the guiding power of the Norm, she <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> showed him how, by her own attained proficiency, he was exceeding his tether. Thereat Māra, dejected and melancholy, vanished. But she discoursed in exultation on what both of them had said, as follows:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v182"><span class="f2 c"><b>[182]</b></span></a> Lo here! a Sister who the fivefold sense<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

							Herself well held in hand, hath made her way<br />
							Where lies the Holy Path, where dwells the Bliss<br />
							Of mastery over action, speech and thought.</p>

					<p class="ctr"><i>Māra.</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v183"><span class="f2 c"><b>[183]</b></span></a> Why now and whereto art thou seen thus garbed<br />
							And shaven like a nun, yet dost not join<br />
							Ascetics of some sect, and share their rites?<br />
							What, futile and infatuate, is thy quest?</p>

					<p class="ctr"><i>Cālā.</i></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v184"><span class="f2 c"><b>[184]</b></span></a> 'Tis they that are without, caught in the net<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />

							'Tis they that have no knowledge of the Truth,<br />
							'Tis they that lack all competence therein.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v185"><span class="f2 c"><b>[185]</b></span></a> Lo! in the princely Sākiya clan is born<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v187"><span class="f2 c"><b>[187]</b></span></a> And I who heard his blessed words abide<br />

					<p>Her story has been told in the foregoing number. Like Cālā, she, too, as Arahant, exulted, after Māra had tempted her in vain, as follows:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v189"><span class="f2 c"><b>[189]</b></span></a> Lo! here a Sister who the fivefold sense<br />
