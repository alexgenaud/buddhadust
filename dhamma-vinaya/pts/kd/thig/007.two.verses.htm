					<p>Born in the time of the Buddha Vipassi, in his native town of Bandhumati, as the daughter of a wealthy burgess, she became a pious lay-adherent, and at the Master's death she made an offering to the shrine of his ashes of a golden umbrella<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> surrounded with jewels. Reborn for this in various heavens, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, reborn at Kapilavatthu as the daughter of the chief wife of Khemaka, the Sākiyan, and named Nanda. But because of her excessive beauty, charm, and loveliness, she was known as Nanda the Fair.</p>

					<p>Now, on the day when she was to choose among her suitors,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> Carabhuta, her young Sākiyan kinsman, died. Then her parents made her leave the world against her will. But she, even after she had entered the Order, was infatuated with her own beauty, and, fearing the Master's rebuke, avoided his presence. Now the Exalted One knew that she was ripe for knowledge, and directed the Great Pajajati to let all the Bhikkhunīs come to him for instruction. Nanda sent another in her place. And the Exalted <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> One said, 'Let no one come by proxy.' So she was compelled to come. And the Exalted One, by his mystic power, conjured up a beautiful woman, and showed her becoming aged and fading, causing anguish to arise in Nanda. And he addressed her in these words:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v19"><span class="f2 c"><b>[19]</b></span></a> Behold, Nanda, the foul compound, diseased,<br />
							Impure! Compel thy heart to contemplate<br />
							What is not fair to view. So steel thyself<br />
							And concentrate the well-compos&egrave;d mind.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v20"><span class="f2 c"><b>[20]</b></span></a> That ponder where no Threefold Sign<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> is seen.<br />

					<p>She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good in this rebirth and that, was born under this Buddha-dispensation in a poor family at Sāvatthī, and was married to a rush-plaiter.

					<p>Born of a respectable family, in the time of Kassapa Buddha, she won understanding, and became a Bhikkhunī, established in the precepts. But she reviled an Arahant Elder Sister by calling her a prostitute,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> and for this she went to purgatory. In this Buddha-dispensation she was <a id="pg26"><span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span></a> reborn in the kingdom of Kāsī as the child of a distinguished and prosperous citizen. But because of the persistent effect of her former evil speech, she became herself a prostitute. How she left the world and was ordained by special messenger is related in the Culla Vagga.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span> For she wished to go to Sāvatthī to be ordained by the Exalted One. But the libertines of Benares barred the ways, so she sent and asked the Exalted One's advice, and he permitted her to be ordained by a messenger. Then she, working at insight, not long after obtained Arahantship, with thorough knowledge of the Dhamma in form and meaning. Thereupon she exclaimed:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v25"><span class="f2 c"><b>[25]</b></span></a> No less my fee was than the Kāsī realm<br />

					<p>She, too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this rebirth and that, was born in the 94th æon<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> as a fairy. She worshipped with offering of flowers a Silent (Pacceka) Buddha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span> And after many other births among men and gods, she was, in this Buddha-dispensation, born at Rājagaha in the family of a leading burgess. When she had come to years of discretion she heard the Master teaching at the gate of Rājagaha, and, becoming a believer, she was ordained by the Great Pājapatī the Gotamid. And at length, in her old age, when she had climbed the Vulture's Peak, and had done the exercises of a recluse, her insight expanded, and she won to Arahantship. Reflecting thereon, she gave utterance as follows:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="v27"><span class="f2 c"><b>[27]</b></span></a> Though I be suffering and weak, and all<br />

By the power of his spells, the chaplain summoned a Yakkha who, by his might, brought the King to Ujjenī. And when she afterwards sent word to the King that she was with child by him, he sent back word, saying: 'If it be a son, let me see him when he is grown.' And she bore a son and called him Abhaya.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The Bojjhangas or Sambojjhangas; lit., parts or limbs of Bodhi. They were mindfulness, research in the Dhamma, energy, joy, serenity, concentration, equanimity (<i>B. Psy.</i>, 84, <i>n.</i> 2. <i>Cf.</i> Ps. xxxi.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> 'For inasmuch as the Exalted One is the very Body of the Norm, to discern the Ariyan Dhamma which is His is to see Him. The Buddhas and other Ariyans are said to be seen, not only by the sight of their visible shape, but also by insight into the Ariyan Dhamma, according as He said: "Verily, Vakkhali, he that seeth the Norm, he seeth me"' <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p87">(<i>Sa.yutta Nikaya</i>, iii., p. 120).</a> '"The Ariyan disciple who hears, brethren, is one who sees the Ariyans"' (Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This is the Elder Sumangala, who in his verse <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p43">(<i>Theragāthā</i>, 43)</a> celebrates his release from three 'crooked things' (<i>supra</i>, <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/006.single.verses.htm#XI">Ps. xi.</a>) — rom sickle, plough, and spade.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Expressed in the text by the representative drudgery of the 'mortar' (<i>musala</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> In the Pali the first two lines depart from the <i>&#347;loka</i> metre, being apparently a curious variety of some metre I cannot identify. See Introduction. The last two lines revert to the <i>&#347;loka</i>, <i>sukhato</i> being an obvious gloss. Quite literally, the quaint and elliptical passage runs: 'The shameless one me "sunshade" only,' which the Commentary explains as 'My husband calls me not even an umbrella which he makes for his livelihood.' There seems nothing in verses or Commentary to justify Dr. Neumann's inference that her husband lived on her adulterous earnings. Toil has spoilt her looks, and he takes no further pleasure in them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Tisso vijjā</i>. The Brahmanic phrase, <i>tevijjo</i>, often recurring below  — <i>e.g.</i>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thig/idx_thig.htm#p36">Ps. xxxvi</a>. — and signifying 'versed in the three Vedas,' was, according to <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p58"><i>Aŋguttara-Nikaya</i>, i. 163-5,</a> adopted by the Buddha and applied to the three attainments of <i>paññā</i>, entitled reminiscence of former births, the Heavenly Eye, and the destruction of the Asavas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Lit., 'Now is my heart (or mind) set free!' For lovers of the mountain, the 'great air' and the sense of spiritual freedom will be tightly bound up. The age of the two climbers throws into relief the arduousness of their spiritual ascent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Mettā in the Commentary. Mittā = amica. <i>Cf.</i> <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/006.single.verses.htm#VIII">Ps. viii.</a> Both Mitta and Mettika (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thig/idx_thig.htm#p24">Ps. xxiv.</a>) may be patronymics, derived ultimately from Mitra (Mithra), the Vedic propitious, friendly Day or Sun god.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>B. Psy.</i>, p. 69. The 'foul things' were corpses or human bones, such as might be seen in any charnel field, where the dead were exposed and not cremated. I have before me a photograph of a Ceylonese bhikkhu seated in the cleft of a rock contemplating two skulls and other bones lying before him — a modern snapshot of a scene that might be 2,500 years old instead of 250 days.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Lit. (as in many other verses), 'done is the will, or rather the system or teaching <i>(sāsanaɱ)</i> of the Buddha.'
