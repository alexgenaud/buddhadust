					<p>S<span class="f2">HE</span> too, having made her resolve under former Buddhas, and heaping up good of age-enduring efficacy in this and that rebirth, thoroughly preparing the conditions of emancipation, was born, when Koṇāgamana was Buddha, in a clansman's family. When she was of age, she and her friends, clansmen's daughters, agreed together to have a great park made, and handed it over to the Buddha and his Order. Through the merit of that act, she was reborn in the heaven of the Three-and-Thirty. After a glorious period there, she arose once more among the Yāma gods, then among the Blissful gods, then among the Happy Creators, then among the Disposers of others' creations,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and there became Queen of the King of the gods. Reborn thereafter, when Kassapa was Buddha, as the daughter of a wealthy citizen, she acquired splendid merit as a lay-believer, winning another rebirth among the gods of the Three-and-Thirty. Finally reborn, in this Buddha-age, at the city of Mantāvatī, as the daughter of King Koñca,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> she was named Sumedhā. And when she was come to years of discretion, her mother and father agreed to let Anikaratta, <a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> the Raja of <i>Varaṇavatī,</i> see her. But she from her childhood had been in the habit of going with Princesses of her own age and attendant slaves to the Bhikkhunīs' quarters to hear them preach the Doctrine, and for a long time, because of her pristine resolve, she had grown fearful of birth in the round of life, devoted to religion and averse to the pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p>Wherefore, when she heard the decision of her parents and kinsfolk, she said: 'My duty lies not in the life of the house. I will leave the world.' And they were not able to dissuade her. She thinking, 'Thus shall I gain permission to leave the world,' laid hold of her purpose, and cut off her own hair. Then using her hair in accordance with what she had heard from the Bhikkhunīs of their methods, she concentrated her attention on repugnance to physical attraction, and calling up the idea of 'Foul Things,'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> then and there attained First Jhana. And when she was thus rapt, her parents came to her apartments in order to give her away. But she made them first and all their retinue and all the Rāja's people believers in religion, and left the house, renouncing the world in the Bhikkhunīs' quarters.</p>

					<p>Not long after, establishing insight, and ripe for emancipation, she attained Arahantship, with thorough grasp of the Norm in form and in meaning. And reflecting on her victory, she broke forth in exultation:</p>

							<a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a> To win! Nor if one come into the four,<br />
							Is there renunciation from <i>that</i> world.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v457"><span class="f2 c"><b>[457]</b></span></a> Suffer ye both that I renounce my world;<br />
							And in the blessed teaching of the Lord,<br />
							Him of the Powers Ten,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> heedless of all<br />
							Without, I'll strive to root out birth and death.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v458"><span class="f2 c"><b>[458]</b></span></a> How can I take delight in many births,<br />
							In this poor body, froth without a soul?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br />
							That I may put an utter end to thirst<br />
							Again to be, suffer that I go forth.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v459"><span class="f2 c"><b>[459]</b></span></a> Now is the Age of Buddhas! Gone the want<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v460"><span class="f2 c"><b>[460]</b></span></a> Thus spake Sumedhā, and again: 'Mother<br />

							Here will I sooner lay me down and die!'</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v461"><span class="f2 c"><b>[461]</b></span></a> Th' afflicted mother wept; the father, stunned<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v468"><span class="f2 c"><b>[468]</b></span></a> Borne in a little while to charnel-field,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v471"><span class="f2 c"><b>[471]</b></span></a> Where one the body to dissect, and turn<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v472"><span class="f2 c"><b>[472]</b></span></a> The factors of my being, organs, elements,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v474"><span class="f2 c"><b>[474]</b></span></a> The wise would with this [bargain] close, and meet<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v480"><span class="f2 c"><b>[480]</b></span></a> Let down the soft black masses of her hair<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="v481"><span class="f2 c"><b>[481]</b></span></a> There sat she lost in ecstasy, the while<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Sāsanakārā</i> = according to the Commentary, Ariyans — <i>i.e.</i>, Arahants, including the Buddhas. Just below, <i>sāsana</i> is rendered by 'system.' Sumedhā = very wise.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> See note, verse 436.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> In Pali 'no eternal rebirth.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Rebirth in 'hell,' as animal, as 'ghost,' as demon, are the four ('purgatorial lives,' <i>vinipāta</i>, in <a href="#v452">452</a>); as human or as god, the two.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> The Ten Powers peculiar to a Tathāgata are: (1) He knows thoroughly right and wrong occasions; (2) he knows thoroughly the effect of all karma-series; (3) the methods for accomplishing anything; (4) the elements (data) of the world; (5) the various tendencies, inclinations, of beings; (6) the capacities of beings; (7) the nature and procedure of all contemplative disciplines; (8) former lives; (9) he has the 'celestial vision'; (10) he has realized the intellectual emancipation of the Arahant (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p21"><i>A.</i>, v. 33 <i>ff</i>.</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>Kāyakalinā asārena</i>. The rendering of the former obscure term is, perhaps, a trifle forced, but was chosen from the use of <i>kali</i> in <i>Jātaka</i>, v. 134 (= <i>khela</i>, spittle, froth), because of the juxtaposition of <i>asāra</i> = pithless, without essence (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p95"><i>cf.

So <i>op. cit.</i>, v. 431: 'It is because we had not grasped the Four Truths, brethren, that we have run and wandered up and down so long, both I and you.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> 'In the Nirayas.' See p. 162, <i>n.</i> 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> The Commentary holds she went on to the other 'signs' — Ill, or Sorrow, and Soullessness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> A mythical ancestor of Sumedhā's and the Buddha's people, the Sākiyas. Mentioned in <i>Ang. Nik.</i>, ii. 7; <i>Jātaka</i>, ii. 310, iii. 454 <i>ff</i>.; <i>Dīpavansa</i>, iii. 5; <i>Mahāvansa</i>, 8, 231; <i>Milindapañha</i>, 115, 291, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> These similes are all quoted from <i>Majjhima Nikāya</i>, i. 180, 364 <i>ff.</i> <i>Cf.</i> <i>Sa.my.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> The text in these four lines gives merely the metaphor As this would call up no associated similes in us, I expand the terms after the similes in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p54"><i>Majjhima Nikāya</i>, 54th Sutta,</a> whence they are borrowed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> A simile frequent in the Nikāyas. Presumably muslin turbans, let alone oily hair-dressing, often caused such mishaps. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Saŋy. Nik.</i>, i. 108, v. 440; <i>Any. Nik.</i>, i. 93, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> These and the following verses are apparently allusions to the first Vagga of the <i>Anamatagga Saɱyutta</i> ('World-without-end' Collocation) in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_15_anamataggasamyutta.htm"><i>Saɱyutta Nikāya</i>, vol. ii., 178 <i>ff.</i></a> The only feature lacking there is the perennial <i>blood</i>-flow — a point not without interest in the history of the Pali Canon. The bone-cairn <i>gāthā</i> in the Vagga is quoted by the Commentator, and runs thus:</p>

					      <p class="in4">'But <i>one</i> man's bones who has <i>one</i> æon lived<br />
							Might form a cairn — so said the Mighty Seer — <br />
							High as Vipulla, higher than the Peak<br />
							Of Vultures, mountain-burg of Magadha' —</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>i.e.</i>, the ancient hill fortress of the Magadhese before they built their capital Rājagaha in the plain. No more ancient remains than these in India have yet been identified (Rhys Davids, <a href="../../../../dhammatalk/buddhist_india_rd/bi.002.clans.htm#pg37"><i>Buddhist India</i>, 37</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The repetition in verses <a href="#v496">496</a>, <a href="#v497">497</a> is curious in a work where redundancy is so severely repressed. Either it goes to strengthen the symptoms that the last two Psalms are by a different and later hand, or else two versions have here been incorporated. In <a href="#v496">496</a> Sumedhā first speaks to all her three chief hearers: 'Call ye to mind' (<i>saratha</i>); the following admonitions are to the Prince only: 'bear in mind' and 'remember' (<i>sarāhi, sara</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> In the Vagga just alluded to, the earth itself, and not India (Jambudīpa), is the insufficient source. The 'squares of straw' is from the same Vagga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> This simile is from <i>Majjhima Nik.</i>, iii. 169, and <i>Saɱyutta Nik.</i>, v. 455. The 'body-parable' is from the latter work (iii. 140). The body (<i>rūpa</i>) is as empty of essence (soul) as the clot of foam drifting down the Ganges.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> The danger from crocodiles is, in two of the Nikāyas, used metaphorically for gluttony, one of the four perils of 'those who go down to the water'; it is in the Canon applied only to a Bhikkhu's temptations (<i>Majjh. Nik.</i>, i. 460; <i>Ang. Nik.</i>, ii. 124).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Nectar = <i>amataŋ</i>, rendered elsewhere in this work by 'ambrosia,' its etymological equivalent. Usually considered one of the many terms for Nibbāna, it is here by the commentarial tradition associated with the Dhamma — 'the Amata of the Norm brought to us by the Very Buddha in his great compassion.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Lit., 'Are bitterer by the fivefold-bitter,' explained by the Commentary as 'by the following after of the yet sharper Ill' (<i>dukkhaŋ</i>). Fivefold, referring to the five senses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> <i>Kuthitā</i> may be from one of three roots: <i>kuth</i>, smell; <i>kuth</i>, distressed; <i>kvath</i>, cook (<i>cf.</i> M&uml;ller, <i>Pali Grammar</i>, 41). The first, chosen by Dr. Neumann, seems forced here. The last accords best with the other three metaphors of heating process.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Lit., 'The unhostile being' (locative absolute). The Pali has <i>no metaphor of place</i> whatever.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Mokkhamhi vijjamāne</i>, lit., exists. <i>Mokkho</i>, probably substituted <i>metri causa</i> for <i>vimutti</i>, is a relatively late term.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> These two terms are, in the text, the same as the corresponding pair in the preceding line.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> In <i>Majjhima Nik.</i>, i. 365, where the torch is said to be borne against the wind, not held too long.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> A simile from <i>Saɱyutta Nik.</i>, ii. 226, — iv. 158; <i>Jātaka</i>, v. 389; vi. 416, 432, 437.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> The dog, according to the Commentary, being unable to get away from them, is killed, and presumably eaten. There is no suggestion to the effect that it was acting as watch-dog, and that the pariahs were thieves, beyond stealing the dog. 'Will they do' = <i>kāhinti;</i> Commentary = <i>karīssanti</i>. Pischel pronounced the other reading <i>khāhinti</i> as 'no doubt correct,' because of a passage in Hemacandra's <i>Prakrit Grammar</i>. But Dhammapāla, nearer to the age of the Therīgatha Pali by at least 500 years, seems to me to have the stronger claim, let alone plausibility.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> She now, says the Commentary, turns to show forth the excellence of Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> <i>Asambadhaŋ</i>. The Commentary takes this figuratively: 'from the absence of the crowd of corruptions' (or torments, <i>kilesā</i>). In view of the cardinal importance in the Vinaya of cultivating solitude (<i>cf.</i> Dhammadinnā in <a href="006.single.verses.htm#XII">Ps. xii.</a>), because, too, of its being the path of the minority, and because of the Suttanta phrase calling the lay life <i>sambādha</i>, and the religious life <i>abbhokāsa</i>, free as air, I incline to take it literally.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> This narrative repeated in from the <i>Apadāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> The two friends are said to have been Khemā (Ps. lii.) and Dhanañjānī, a brahminee convert (<i>Saŋ. Nik.</i>, i. 160).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> For these, see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/bs/dn.17.rhyt.bs_6.1.htm#fn25"><i>Buddhist Suttas</i> (S.B.E., xi.), pp. 251 <i>ff.</i></a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> This line expands the Pali word <i>virajjati</i>, according to the commentary, which supplements 'purified' by  'set free.' On the metre of the whole Psalm, see Introduction.</p>
