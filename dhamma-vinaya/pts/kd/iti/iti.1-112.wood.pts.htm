					<h4><a id="intro">Translator's Preface</a></h4>

					<p>These one hundred and twelve short suttas with verses are called 'The thus spoken,'and derive their title from the emphatic statement both at beginning and end of each that the Exalted One uttered them, together with the verses. That this is in some cases impossible from internal evidence I have shown in the notes — e.g., in cases where the (supposed) Teacher indulges in extravagant self-praise. The prose passages are evidently explanations of the verses, not <i>vice versa,</i> but sometimes the two do not harmonize. The titles of the suttas in the  <a id="pgviii" href="#pgviii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[viii]</b></span></a> <i>uddanas</i> or summaries refer to the prose part, not the verses.</p>
					
					<p>As to the origin of the collection: we read in the Commentary attributed to Dhammapala, pp. 29 <i>ff.</i> (of the P.T.S., ed. by <i>M.</i> M. Bose, Calcutta), that the woman-disciple Khujjuttarā (Uttarā, the hump-backed), used to go frequently to listen to the Teacher when he was instructing the monks. She sat behind a curtain when he was thus engaged at Kosambī, and thus became <i>bahussutā</i> or one who had heard much, versed in <i>dhamma</i> and of great wisdom. She was asked by the ladies of the royal harem of the rajah Udena to tell them what she heard and to instruct them. She did so, and all of them learned by heart what she told them. Later on she was named both by the Teacher and her fellows 'pre-eminent of the learned'(<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/01_ones/an01.258-295.wood.pts.htm#p260">AN. I, 26</a>). The tradition arose that it was Itivuttaka that she repeated thus, but there is no evidence of this.</p>
					
					<p>The Commentator goes on to say that 'by handing on in succession 5 <i>(paramparāya)</i> the monks too came to learn these suttas, but that Ànanda at the First Council at Rājagaha rehearsed them in their present form, prefacing to each the phrase 'Thus have I heard; this was spoken by the Exalted One,'etc., and concluding the prose and verse with a similar statement. He admits, however, that there were some who put difficulties in the way <i>(papañcenti)</i> of this conclusion, but sweeps the objection aside. The verses are doubtless genuine in parts. Verse is more easily memorized than prose, and the Teacher is not likely to have spoken prose in any fixed form. He would teach in a conversational way, using familiar words, summing up what he had said in concise verses, as is the fashion in India. The work is evidently edited by and for monks, not laymen or women; the word 'nun'occurs once only in one sutta.</p>
					
					<p>As will be seen, after Sutta 79 the introductory and concluding formula is omitted saving at the beginning of No. 80 and end of 89. This may be because the editors thought it unnecessary. No. 99 has it both at beginning and end; No. 100 at the beginning, and of the rest the  <a id="pgix" href="#pgix"><span class="f2 g"><b>[ix]</b></span></a> last only has it at the end. The suttas of the Fourth Section are longer and of narrative form, and may be late additions, for, as noted below, they do not appear in the Chinese version at all. A number of suttas occur in <i>Aṇguttara</i> and <i>Puggala-Paññatti,</i> and the work is put together on the principle of 'add one'(<i>Aṇguttara</i> or <i>Gradual</i>).</p>
					
					<p>It is of interest to compare our version of these suttas with a Chinese collection, translated evidently from Sanskrit A.D. 650 by Yuan Chwang, who brought Buddhist scriptures from India. On this subject K. Watanabe wrote in the <a href="../../../../resources/pdf/jpts/jpts_1906-7_v.pdf"><i>Journal of the Pali Text Society</i>, 1906-7,</a> p. 45. This Chinese collection agrees in the main with the Pali version, but in the Third <i>Nipāta</i> or section, he says, three-fifths of the suttas of the Pali cannot be identified with the Chinese, while the whole of the Fourth <i>Nipāta</i> is lacking in the Chinese, there being only 65 suttas out of our 112. Again, some of the Chinese suttas are not found in the Pali. The prose parts of the Chinese are longer and more diffuse.</p>
					
					<p>In the same volume of the <i>J.P.T.S.</i> will be found a collation of our text (which is by Windisch) with the Siamese edition, done by Mr. J.H. Moore, who in 1908 published a translation (Columbia Univ. Press) of our volume under the title of <i>Sayings of Buddha</i>.</p>
					
					<p>I am indebted to Mr. A.J. Edmunds of Philadelphia, U.S.A., the author of the two volumes <i>Buddhist and Christian Gospels,</i> 1909, for a typed copy of his own translation of the earlier suttas, on which he lectured some years ago. At one time he had intended finishing the work. Also to Mr. E.M. Hare for the loan of his Sinhalese editions of both Text and Commentary, which I have used throughout. As I write this comes to hand the first half of Mr. Bose's edition of the Commentary, published by the P.T.S.</p>
					
					<p>Mrs. Rhys Davids has kindly consented to write for me an introduction to both works contained in this volume.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Sutta titles adopted from the Ireland translation where he remarks in his introduction:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"The titles of the suttas are taken from the Burmese edition of the text. The PTS edition does not include them, though they can be deduced from the summaries found at the end of each vagga. Woodward also does not give them in his translation. The use of initial titles is actually a modern innovation of the printed book. The tradition in Pali literature is either the end-name — often several alternatives are given for important works — or else the summary at the end of the vagga, making use of one or more key words from each of the suttas. The summaries originally served as a device to aid memory in an oral tradition which lacked the benefit of the printed word."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn2" href="#edfn2">ed2</a>]</sup> I have had to alter the punctuation of this section of this sutta in order to unabridge it properly.</p>
