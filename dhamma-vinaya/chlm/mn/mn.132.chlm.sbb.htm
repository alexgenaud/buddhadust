					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverendĀnanda by homily in Hall instructed,<br />
					informed,<br />
					enlightened <a id="pt190" href="../../pali/mn/mn.132.pali.bd.htm#pg190"><span class="f2">[190]</span></a> and heartened the Almsmen,<br />
					teaching them the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rising at eventide from his meditations,<br />
					the Lord came to Hall<br />
					and there sat down on the seat set for him,<br />
					asking who had been giving instruction<br />
					and reciting the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Being told that it was Ānanda,<br />
					the Lord asked him how exactly he had proceeded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">ThenĀnanda repeated to him<br />
					word for word</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>
							
					<p class="f4">How, Almsmen, does a man hark back to the past? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By finding delight in remembering<br />
					that in a previous birth in the past<br />
					such and such was he like,<br />
					such and such were his feelings,<br />
					his perceptions,<br />
					his plastic forces<br />
					and his mentality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a man not hark back? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By not finding delight in such memories.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a man have longings for the future? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By finding delight in the longing<br />
					that in later births in the future<br />
					he may be such and such,<br />
					with such and such feelings and so forth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a man not have longings for the future? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By not finding delight in any such aspirations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is a man swept away by present states of consciousness? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed everyday man<br />

					perceptions,<br />
					the plastic forces<br />
					and the mind. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is how a man is swept away.</p>
