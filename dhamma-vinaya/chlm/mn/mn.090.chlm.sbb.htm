					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Ujjuññā in the deer-park of Kaṇṇakatthala,<br />
					Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					who was at Ujjuññā on some business or other,<br />
					sent a messenger to bow his head at the Lord's feet<br />
					as he asked in the king's name<br />
					after the Lord's health,<br />
					and to say that soon after his meal<br />
					the king would come to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">This message was duly delivered.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing of his projected visit,<br />
					the two sisters,<br />
					Queen Somā and Queen Sakulā <a id="pt126" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg126"><span class="f2">[126]</span></a> came to the king in the refectory<br />
					with the request that he would make -<br />
					in their names -<br />
					the like enquiry about the Lord's health.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg67"><span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span></a> On paying his visit after his meal,<br />
					the king, after saluting the Lord,<br />
					seated himself to one side<br />
					and delivered the message sent by the two sisters.</p>

					<p class="f4">How comes it, sire,<br />
					that they found no other messenger?</p>

					<p class="f4">As they heard I was coming here to-day,<br />
					they asked me to convey their enquiries in person.</p>

					<p class="f4">May good fortune attend them, sire!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the king: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard it said<br />
					that the recluse Gotama declares<br />
					no recluse or brahmin can ever,<br />
					in the plenitude of ken and vision,<br />
					claim absolute knowledge and insight.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt127" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg127"><span class="f2">[127]</span></a> Now, is this witness true, -<br />
					not misrepresenting the Lord<br />
					and not misstating the gist of his doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">The witness is not true;<br />
					it imputes to me<br />
					what is false and untrue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the king to Viḍūḍabha the general: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Who put this story about in the palace?</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmin Sañjaya Ākāsagotta, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sending a messenger to summon the brahmin to his presence,<br />
					the king said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Can it be that,<br />
					though originally uttered about something else,<br />
					the Lord's words have been transferred by people<br />
					to a quite different subject?</p>

					<p class="f4">In what sense does the Lord acknowledge<br />
					having made his statement?</p>

					<p class="f4">What I acknowledge having said was that,<br />
					at one and the same time,<br />
					no recluse or brahmin can know and see everything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Casually,<br />
					and with reference to causation,<br />
					the Lord has said this.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt128" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg128"><span class="f2">[128]</span></a> Now, sir, is there any distinction or difference<br />
					between the four classes of Nobles,<br />
					brahmins,<br />
					middle-class people<br />
					and peasants?</p>

					<p class="f4">Two out of the four classes take precedence, sire,<br />
					in the way these are addressed,<br />
					received,<br />
					approached and treated.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was not asking the Lord<br />
					about things here and now;<br />
					my question relates to their destinies hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are five qualities<br />
					for striving after the truth. -</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) An Almsman has confidence,<br />
					is confident,<br />
					is sure of the Truth-finder's enlightenment,<br />
					namely that his Lord,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walks by knowledge,<br />
					is blessed,<br />
					understands all worlds,<br />
					and is the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment;<br />
					(ii) he has health and strength,<br />
					having a good digestion<br />
					maintained by humours<br />
					neither too hot nor too cold<br />
					but medium and apt for the struggle;<br />
					(iii) he is not dishonest nor underhand,<br />
					but reveals his true nature to his master<br />
					or to sage brethren in the higher life;
					(iv) he is resolute,<br />
					ever discarding wrong states of mind<br />
					and fostering right states,<br />
					ever staunch and stout of purpose,<br />
					persistent in right mindedness; and<br />
					(v) he has a wit<br />
					that pierces through the rise and fall of things,<br />
					that is noble and penetrating,<br />
					that leads to the utter destruction of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">If <a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> now the four classes possess these five qualities,<br />
					it will be to their abiding weal and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">If all four classes <a id="pt129" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg129"><span class="f2">[129]</span></a> had all five qualities,<br />
					would there be any distinction or difference between them?</p>

					<p class="f4">I premise, sire,<br />
					differing degrees of capacity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as though there were one pair of young elephants<br />
					or colts<br />
					or steers<br />
					who had been schooled and trained,<br />
					while another pair had not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the first pair,<br />
					being trained,<br />
					attain to trained capacity<br />
					and rank as trained?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the second pair,<br />
					being untrained,<br />
					do the same?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same, sire,<br />
					with what an Almsman can achieve<br />
					with confidence,<br />
					health,<br />
					honesty,<br />
					strenuous effort<br />
					and understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">He cannot possibly achieve it<br />
					without such an equipment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Casually,<br />
					and with reference to causation,<br />
					the Lord has said this.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, now, all four classes<br />
					had all five qualities<br />
					and had them to the full,<br />
					would there then be any distinction<br />
					or difference between them?</p>

					<p class="f4">In such case,<br />
					I recognize no difference, -<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					in Deliverance as against Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like one man<br />
					lighting a fire with a dry stick of brushwood,<br />
					and a second man <a id="pt180" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> lighting his with a stick of sal-wood,<br />
					while a third man employs a mango stick<br />
					and the fourth a stick of figwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you expect any difference<br />
					in flame, hue or brilliance<br />
					between the four fires,<br />
					though kindled from different woods?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same, sire,<br />
					with the illumination<br />
					which is kindled by effort<br />
					and fired by striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein, I recognize no difference, -<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					in Deliverance as against Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Causally,<br />
					and with reference to causation,<br />
					the Lord has said this. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there gods, sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why ask such a question?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do gods come back to life on earth or not?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> The malign do;<br />
					the benign do not.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point Viḍūḍabha asked the Lord<br />
					whether the malign gods<br />
					who must return to an earthly life<br />
					can expel or banish from their abodes<br />
					those benign gods<br />
					who will never return to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought the reverend Ānanda: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This Viḍūḍabha is the son of Pasenadi, king of Kosala;<br />
					and I am the Lord's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for son to talk with son.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he said to Viḍūḍabha: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I will ask you a question in return,<br />
					for such<br />
					answer as you may see fit to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the kingdom of Kosala<br />
					and within the range of his sovereignty and sway,<br />
					<a id="pt181" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> has the king power to expel or banish<br />
					any recluse or brahmin,<br />
					anyone either virtuous or not virtuous,<br />
					anyone leading or not leading the higher life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, my good sir;<br />
					he has that power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Has he that power outside his own dominions?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you ever heard of the Thirty-three gods?</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh, yes;<br />
					and so has his majesty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me;<br />
					can the king of Kosala<br />
					expel or banish them from their abodes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, he cannot even see them,<br />
					much less expel or banish them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, general,<br />
					the malign gods<br />
					cannot even see the benign gods,<br />
					much less expel<br />
					or banish them from their abodes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the name, sir,<br />
					of this Almsman? asked the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Joyous (Ānanda) is his name,<br />
					and joyous is his nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spoke causally <a id="pt182" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg182"><span class="f2">[182]</span></a> and with reference to causation. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Does Brahmā exist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why ask such a question?</p>

					<p class="f4">Does he,<br />
					or does he not,<br />
					return to life on earth?</p>

					<p class="f4">A malign Brahmā does;<br />
					a benign Brahmā does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point,<br />
					the brahmin Sañjaya Ākāsagotta was announced<br />
					and was asked by the king<br />
					who put that story about in the palace.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was Viḍūḍabha, the general,<br />
					said the brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> It was the brahmin Safijaya Akasagotta,<br />
					said the general.</p>

					<p class="f4">The king's carriage being now announced,<br />
					the king said to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I asked the Lord about omniscience<br />
					and he explained omniscience to me<br />
					in a manner which pleases,<br />
					satisfies and gladdens me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I asked him about the purity of the four classes<br />
					and he explained it to me<br />
					in a manner which pleases,<br />
					satisfies and gladdens me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I asked him about the supreme Brahmā<br />
					and he explained him to me<br />
					in a manner which pleases,<br />
					satisfies and gladdens me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has explained to me<br />
					everything about which I asked,<br />
					in a manner which pleases,<br />
					satisfies and gladdens me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now <a id="pt188" href="../../pali/mn/mn.090.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a> I must be going, sir;<br />
					I have much to do and attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">At your pleasure, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having expressed his satisfactions and thanks<br />
					for what the Lord had told him,<br />
					Pasenadi, king of Kosala, saluted the Lord<br />
					and with deep reverence departed.</p>
