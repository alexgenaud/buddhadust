					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					and a great number of Almsmen<br />
					were sitting in company together in the hall<br />
					after their meal<br />
					on return from their alms-round,<br />
					the following talk arose among them: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sirs,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					to what a pitch the Lord<br />
					who knows and sees,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has cultivated and developed<br />
					that mindfulness of body<br />
					which is called the mindfulness<br />
					abundant in fruit and blessings!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here the talk broke off;<br />
					for, when at evening<br />
					the Lord arose from his meditations,<br />
					he came to the seat set for him in hall,<br />
					and asked what subject had engaged them<br />
					in their conclave<br />
					and what talk had been broken off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt89" href="../../pali/mn/mn.119.pali.bd.htm#pg89"><span class="f2">[89]</span></a>	They told him,<br />
					adding that here the talk had broken off,<br />
					as the Lord appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, Almsmen,<br />
					is mindfulness of body<br />
					cultivated and developed<br />
					so as to abound in fruit and blessings? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who,<br />
					in the forest<br />
					or at the foot of a tree<br />
					or in an abode of solitude,<br />
					sits cross-legged<br />
					with body erect,<br />
					with mindfulness<br />
					as the objective he sets before himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In mindfulness he takes in breath<br />
					and in mindfulness he exhales it;<br />
					he knows precisely what he is doing<br />
					when he is inhaling or exhaling<br />
					either a long breath<br />
					or a short breath;<br />
					he schools himself,<br />
					as he draws his breath in and out,<br />
					to be alive to his body as a whole<br />
					or to still bodily factors.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he dwells thus unflagging,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					all worldly thoughts<br />
					that idly come and go<br />
					are abandoned,<br />
					and with their abandonment<br />
					his heart within<br />
					grows stablished and planted fast,<br />
					settled and concentrated. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way,<br />
					an Almsman develops mindfulness of body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Walking or sitting or lying down,<br />
					in every posture <a id="pg206"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span></a> of his body,<br />
					he knows precisely what he is doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he dwells thus unflagging,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					all worldly thoughts<br />
					that idly come and go<br />
					are abandoned,<br />
					and with their abandonment<br />
					his heart within<br />
					grows stablished and planted fast,<br />
					settled and concentrated. -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt90" href="../../pali/mn/mn.119.pali.bd.htm#pg90"><span class="f2">[90]</span></a> Again, the Almsman is always mindful and purposeful<br />
					whether in going forward or back,<br />
					in looking before or behind,<br />
					in drawing in or stretching out his limbs,<br />
					in conduct of cloak, bowl and robes,<br />
					in eating and drinking,<br />
					in chewing and tasting,<br />
					in attending to the needs of nature,<br />
					in walking or standing still,<br />
					in sitting or in lying down,<br />
					asleep or awake,<br />
					speaking or silent.</p>

					his heart within<br />
					grows stablished and planted fast,<br />
					settled and concentrated. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way,<br />
					an Almsman develops mindfulness of body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Again, the Almsman reflects on this self-same body,<br />
					from the soles of the foot<br />
					to the crown of the head,<br />
					as a thing bounded by skin<br />
					and full of various impurities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is in this body, says he,<br />
					hair of head or body,<br />
					nails and teeth,<br />
					skin and flesh,<br />
					sinews, bones and marrow,<br />
					kidneys, heart and liver,<br />

					synovial fluid and urine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as if there was a two-mouthed sack<br />
					full of various grains -<br />
					such as rice and paddy,<br />
					beans and vetches,<br />
					sesame and husked rice -,<br />
					and a man with eyes to see<br />
					were to reflect as he emptied the sack<br />
					that here was rice,<br />

					here was sesame<br />

					<p class="f4">The Four Ecstasies<br />
					with their vivid illumination,<br />
					which here and now <a id="pt98" href="../../pali/mn/mn.119.pali.bd.htm#pg98"><span class="f2">[98]</span></a> bring well-being into life, -<br />
					these he induces at will,<br />
					without trouble or difficulty.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops the divers psychic powers; -<br />
					from being one to become manifold,<br />
					from being manifold to become one,<br />
					to be visible and invisible,<br />
					to pass at will through wall or fence or hill<br />
					as if in air,<br />
					to pass in and out of the solid earth<br />
					as if it were water,<br />
					to walk on the water"s unbroken surface<br />
					as if it were the solid earth,<br />
					seated in state to glide through the air<br />
					like a bird on the wing,<br />
					to touch and to handle the sun and moon<br />
					in their power and might,<br />
					and to extend the sovereignty of his body<br />
					right up to the Brahmā world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the Ear Celestial<br />
					that is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					he hears sounds celestial<br />
					and sounds human<br />
					both far and near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His heart knows the hearts of other creatures<br />
					and of other men,<br />
					knows them for what they are, -<br />
					the heart where passion dwells as passionate,<br />
					the passionless heart as passionless,<br />
					the unkind heart as unkind,<br />
					the kindly heart as kindly,<br />
					the deluded heart as deluded,<br />
					the undeluded heart as undeluded,<br />
					the concentrated heart as concentrated,<br />
					the unconcentrated heart as unconcentrated,<br />
					the great heart as great<br />
					and the little heart as little,<br />
					the inferior heart as inferior<br />
					and the superior heart as superior,<br />
					the stedfast heart as <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> stedfast<br />
					and the unstedfast heart as unstedfast,<br />
					the heart Delivered as Delivered,<br />
					and the undelivered heart as undelivered.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He recalls his own divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single <a id="pt99" href="../../pali/mn/mn.119.pali.bd.htm#pg99"><span class="f2">[99]</span></a> birth,<br />
					then two-etc. -<br />
					divers existences in the past in all their details and features.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial<br />
					that is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees creatures in act to pass hence,<br />
					in act to reappear elsewhere, -<br />
					creatures either lowly or debonair,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					happy or unhappy;<br />
					and he knows well that they fare according to their past deeds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the extinction of the Cankers,<br />
					he develops and dwells in<br />
					that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					where Cankers are not,<br />
					a Deliverance which,<br />
					of and by himself,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					he has discerned and realized.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the ten blessings, Almsmen,<br />
					that may be anticipated,<br />
					if mindfulness of body be cultivated<br />
					in the way I have stated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
