					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he was alone with his meditations<br />
					when the thought came to him that,<br />
					as Rāhula was now ripe<br />
					in the qualities which mature unto Deliverance,<br />
					he might school him in the eradication of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when next morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					he had been into Sāvatthī for alms<br />
					and was back again after his meal,<br />
					the Lord told Rāhula to bring a mat to sit on<br />
					and they would go together<br />
					to pass the heat of the day in Andha-vana.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt278" href="../../pali/mn/mn.147.pali.bd.htm#pg278"><span class="f2">[278]</span></a> Obedient to the Lord's commands,<br />
					the reverend Rāhula took a mat<br />
					and followed behind in the Lord's footsteps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time some thousands of deities followed <a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> after the Lord,<br />
					because the Lord would that day<br />
					school Rāhula in the eradication of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Plunging into Andha-vana's glades,<br />
					the Lord took his seat at the foot of a tree<br />
					on the mat set for him;<br />
					and Rāhula too,<br />
					with salutations,<br />
					seated himself hard by.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Rāhula sat there,<br />
					the Lord put this question to Rāhula: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Is sight permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the impermanent fraught with Weal or Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">With Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it proper,<br />
					when a thing is fraught with Ill and change,<br />
					to regard it as -<br />
					Mine,<br />
					or this is I,<br />
					or this is My Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the impermanent fraught ...<br />
					this is my Self?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt279" href="../../pali/mn/mn.147.pali.bd.htm#pg279"><span class="f2">[279]</span></a> No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is visual Contact permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the impermanent fraught ...<br />
					this is my Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are feelings,<br />
					or perception<br />
					or factors<br />
					or the consciousness<br />
					which arises under the conditions of visual contact, -<br />
					permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the impermanent fraught ...<br />
					this is my Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And is all this equally true<br />
					of hearing,<br />
					smelling,<br />
					tasting,<br />
					touching<br />
					and the mind<br />
					and of their respective sense-objects?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he sees all this, Rāhula,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					becomes sick and weary of<br />
					sight,<br />
					form,<br />
					visual contact<br />
					and of the feelings and so forth thence arising;<br />
					sick and weary of<br />
					hearing,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					auditory contact,<br />
					and the feelings and so forth thence arising;<br />
					sick and weary of<br />
					smell,<br />
					odours,<br />
					olfactory contact,<br />
					and the feelings and so forth thence arising;<br />
					sick and weary of<br />
					taste,<br />
					savours,<br />
					gustatory contact,<br />
					and the feelings and <a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> so forth thence arising;<br />
					sick and weary too of<br />
					mind,<br />
					mental objects,<br />
					mental contact,<br />
					and the feelings and so forth thence arising; -<br />
					<a id="pt280" href="../../pali/mn/mn.147.pali.bd.htm#pg280"><span class="f2">[280]</span></a> sick and weary of it all;<br />
					and so is Delivered<br />
					and to him, being Delivered,<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction that this is his last birth,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there is now no more of what he has been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="f4">While this exposition was being spoken,<br />
					the reverend Rāhula's heart was delivered from the Cankers<br />
					by leaving nothing to support them.</p>

					<p class="f4">There arose, too,<br />
					in all those thousands of deities<br />
					the passionless and stainless Eye of Truth,<br />
					whereby they saw<br />
					how everything that originates<br />
					must also cease to be.</p>
