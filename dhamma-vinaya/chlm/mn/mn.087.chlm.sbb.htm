					<p class="f4">Once while the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the darling only son of a certain householder died,<br />
					and the loss made the father neglect his business<br />
					and his meals;<br />
					he was always going to the charnel ground,<br />
					wailing aloud: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where are you, my son?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where are you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To this bereaved father,<br />
					when he had come<br />
					and taken his seat to one side<br />
					after due salutations,<br />
					the Lord said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You are not yourself;<br />
					your mind is all awry.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could my mind not be awry, sir,<br />
					when I have lost my darling only son?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His death has made me neglect my business<br />
					and my meals;<br />
					time and again I go to the charnel ground,<br />
					wailing aloud: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where are you, my son?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where are you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, householder;<br />
					our dear ones bring sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who, sir,<br />
					can entertain such a view?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nay, our dear ones<br />
					are a joy and happiness to us!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And with these words<br />
					the householder, rejecting the Lord's pronouncement,<br />
					indignantly got up and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hard by,<br />
					there were a number of gamblers<br />
					having a game with the dice;<br />
					and to them came the house- <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> holder<br />
					with his story of <a id="pt107" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg107"><span class="f2">[107]</span></a> how he had related his sorrows to the recluse Gotama,<br />
					how he had been received,<br />
					and how he had indignantly departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You were quite right, said the gamblers;<br />
					for,<br />
					our dear ones are indeed a joy and happiness to us.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the householder felt<br />
					he had got the gamblers on his side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now all this, in due course,<br />
					penetrated to the private apartments of the royal palace,<br />
					where the king told Queen Mallika<br />
					that 'her recluse Gotama'<br />
					had stated that our dear ones<br />
					bring sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, sire, if the Lord said so,<br />
					so it is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a pupil accepts all his master tells him,<br />
					saying 'So it is, sir;<br />
					so it is,<br />
					- just in the same way, Mallika,<br />
					you accept all the recluse Gotama says,<br />
					with your <a id="pt108" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg108"><span class="f2">[108]</span></a> 'If the Lord said so,<br />
					so it is.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Away with you and begone!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the queen told the brahmin Nāḷi-jangha to go to the Lord<br />
					and, in her name, to bow his head at the Lord's feet<br />
					and, after asking after his health,<br />
					to enquire whether he had really said<br />
					what was attributed to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And be careful, she added,<br />
					to tell me exactly what the Lord answers;<br />
					for, Truth-finders never tell an untruth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In obedience to the queen's commands,<br />
					the brahmin went off<br />
					and duly asked the Lord whether he had really said so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, brahmin; - our dear ones do bring sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here is a proof.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Once on a time,<br />
					here in Sāvatthī,<br />
					a woman's mother died and the daughter,<br />
					crazed and beside herself,<br />
					went about from street to street<br />
					and from crossroads to cross-roads,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Have you seen my mother?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Have you seen my mother?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt109" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg109"><span class="f2">[109]</span></a> Another proof is a woman of Sāvatthī<br />
					who lost her father -<br />
					a brother -<br />
					a sister -<br />
					a son -<br />
					a daughter -<br />
					a husband.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Crazed and beside herself,<br />
					the woman went about from street to street<br />
					and from cross-roads to cross-roads,<br />
					asking if anyone had seen the dear one she had lost.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> Another proof is a man of Sāvatthī<br />
					who lost his mother -<br />
					his father -<br />
					a brother -<br />
					a sister -<br />
					a son -<br />
					a daughter -<br />
					a wife.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Crazed and beside himself<br />
					the man went about from street to street<br />
					and from cross-roads to cross-roads,<br />
					asking if anyone had seen the dear one he had lost.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Another proof is the Sāvatthī woman<br />
					who visited her own people's home;<br />
					and they wanted to take her from her husband<br />
					and marry her to someone else<br />
					whom she did not like.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">She told her husband about this;<br />
					whereupon he cut her in two<br />
					<a id="pt110" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg110"><span class="f2">[110]</span></a> and then killed himself,<br />
					so that they might both die together.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All this the brahmin duly reported to the queen,<br />
					who went away to the king with the question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Are you fond, sire,<br />
					of your only daughter,<br />
					the princess Vajīrī?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I am.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to your Vajīrī,<br />
					would you feel sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to her,<br />
					it would make a great difference to my life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could I escape feeling sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, that is what was meant by the Lord<br />
					who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arabat all-enlightened,<br />
					when he declared that our dear ones<br />
					bring sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Are you fond, sire,<br />
					of your queen Vāsabhā?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I am.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to your Vāsabhā,<br />
					would you feel sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to her,<br />
					it would make a great difference to my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you fond,<br />

					of Viḍūḍabha,<br />
					your general?</p>
					 					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt111" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg111"><span class="f2">[111]</span></a> Yes, I am.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you fond, sire,<br />
					of the people of Kasi and Kosala?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I am.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is my sovereignty over them<br />
					which clothes me in Benares muslins<br />
					and gives me my garlands,<br />
					perfumes and unguents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to them,<br />
					would you feel sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />
					and tribulation?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anything happened to them,<br />
					it would make a <a id="pg59"><span class="f2 g"><b>[59]</b></span></a> great difference -<br />
					how could it be otherwise? -<br />
					to my own life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, that, sire,<br />
					is what was meant by the Lord<br />
					who know and sees,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					when he declared that our dear ones<br />
					bring sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, Mallikā,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					how <a id="pt112" href="../../pali/mn/mn.087.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2">[112]</span></a> the Lord's insight<br />
					penetrates and discerns.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bring me water for ablution, Mallikā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereafter, Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					rose up,<br />
					reverently bared one shoulder,<br />
					and, with folded palms<br />
					stretched out to where the Lord was,<br />
					thrice burst forth with -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All honour to the Lord,<br />
					arahat all enlightened!</p>
