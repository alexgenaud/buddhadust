					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">Eleven qualities disable a herdsman from looking after his herd and from promoting its increase;<br />
					and here are the eleven:</p>

					<p class="f4">A herdsman<br />
					(i) is ignorant of form,<br />
					(ii) has no eye for marks,<br />
					(iii) does not get out ticks,<br />
					(iv) does not dress sores,<br />
					(v) does not smoke out (the lairs),<br />
					(vi) knows nothing either of fords or<br />
					(vii) watering-places or<br />
					(viii) roads or<br />
					(ix) pastures,<br />
					(x) milks dry, and<br />
					(xi) fails to tend with special attention the bulls that are the sires and leaders of the herd.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too eleven qualities disable an Almsman from shewing growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and progress in this Doctrine and Rule;<br />
					and here are the eleven:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman<br />
					(i) is ignorant of form,<br />
					(ii) has no eye for marks,<br />
					(iii) does not get out ticks,<br />
					(iv) does not dress sores,<br />
					(v) does not smoke out (the lairs),<br />
					(vi) knows nothing either of fords or<br />
					(vii) watering-places or<br />
					(viii) roads or<br />
					(ix) pastures,<br />
					(x) milks dry, and<br />
					(xi) fails to tend with special attention those of the Brotherhood who are experienced and senior Elders,<br />
					the sires and leaders of the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is an Almsman ignorant of form?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by not really comprehending that each and every form consists of the four prime elements or is derivative therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">How has an Almsman no eye for marks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by not really comprehending what marks the doings of the fool and the doings of the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does an Almsman not get out ticks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, either by giving in to a thought that has arisen about sensuous pleasures -<br />
					or about hurt -<br />
					or about cruelty, -<br />
					or by giving in to evil and wrong states of mind as they arise from time to time,<br />
					instead of putting them from him,<br />
					instead of discarding and destroying them<br />
					so as to make them cease to exist.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does an Almsman not dress sores?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, when, seeing with his eye a visible shape,<br />
					he is taken <a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> up with its detailed characteristics and marks, and -<br />
					albeit, if he lives with eye uncontrolled,<br />
					appetite and depression,<br />
					together with evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					might stream in upon him -<br />
					he yet lives not to control his faculty of sight,<br />
					keeps no watch and ward over it,<br />
					and fails to develop control over his faculty of sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">[And so likewise with the other five senses.]</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he not smoke out the lairs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by not expounding to others the Doctrine which he has himself heard and learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he know nothing of fords?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by not going from time to time to learned Almsmen -<br />
					the channels of the word<br />
					and the repositories of the Doctrine and Rule and text -<br />
					to ask and enquire of them how this is,<br />
					or what that means.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence, they do not open up what is closed to him,<br />
					do not clear up for him what was not clear,<br />
					nor remove his doubts in divers ideas of perplexity.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he know nothing of watering-places?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by failing, when there is preaching of the Truth-finder's Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					to take in knowledge of welfare and of the Doctrine,<br />
					or to get the gladness which the Doctrine brings.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he know nothing of roads?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by having no real comprehension of the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he know nothing of pastures?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by having no real comprehension of the fourfold mustering up of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he milk dry?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, when believing householders bring out and offer him robes and the other requisites,<br />
					he knows no bounds in what he takes.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he fail to tend with special attention those of the Brotherhood who are experienced and senior Elders,<br />
					the sires and leaders of the Confraternity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by not ministering to them -<br />
					both openly and in secret -<br />
					with acts of love,<br />
					with words of love,<br />
					and with thoughts of love.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eleven qualities bring the herdsman success in <a id="pg159"><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span></a> looking after his herd and in promoting its increase;<br />
					and here are the eleven:</p>

					<p class="f4">A herdsman<br />
					(i) has knowledge of form<br />
					(ii) has an eye for marks,<br />
					(iii) gets out ticks,<br />
					(iv) dresses sores,<br />
					(v) smokes out the lairs,<br />
					(vi) knows about fords and<br />
					(vii) watering-places and<br />
					(viii) roads and<br />
					(ix) pastures,<br />
					(x) does not milk dry, and<br />
					(xi) tends with special attention<br />
					the bulls that are the sires and leaders of the herd.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too eleven qualities enable an Almsman to shew growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and progress in the Doctrine and Rites;<br />
					and here are the eleven:</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman<br />
					(i) has knowledge of form,<br />
					(ii) has an eye for marks,<br />
					(iii) gets out ticks,<br />
					(iv) dresses sores,<br />
					(v) smokes out the lairs,<br />
					(vi) knows about fords and<br />
					(vii) watering-places and<br />
					(viii) roads and<br />
					(ix) pastures,<br />
					(x) does not milk dry, and<br />
					(xi) tends with special attention those of the Brotherhood who are experienced and senior Elders,<br />
					the sires and leaders of the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">[In each and every one of these respects he is,<br />
					and does, the precise opposite of the foregoing Brother.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
