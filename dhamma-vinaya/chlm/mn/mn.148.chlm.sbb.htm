					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he there addressed the listening Almsmen: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Doctrine -<br />
					so lovely in its beginning,<br />
					so lovely in the middle<br />
					and so lovely in its close -<br />
					with its meaning and text,<br />
					the complete and pure higher life, -<br />
					namely,<br />
					the Six Sixes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Listen<br />
					and pay attention<br />
					and I will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Brethren the Lord began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are six internal senses,<br />
					six external sense-objects,<br />
					six groups of perceptions,<br />
					six groups of Contacts,<br />
					six groups of feelings,<br />
					and six groups of cravings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have said that there are six internal senses to be recognized;<br />
					and these are the senses of<br />
					sight,<br />
					hearing,<br />
					smell,<br />
					taste,<br />
					touch and<br />
					mind. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These form the first Six.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt281" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg281"><span class="f2">[281]</span></a> I have said that sense-objects are six in number;<br />
					and they are<br />
					forms,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					touch and<br />
					mental objects. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These form the second Six.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have said there are six groups of perceptions;<br />
 					<a id="pg316"><span class="f2 g"><b>[316]</b></span></a> 					they are the classes of perceptions<br />
					which severally arise from<br />
					(a) sight and forms,<br />
					(b) hearing and sounds,<br />

					(d) taste and savours,<br />
					(e) touch and tangible things, and<br />
					(f) mind and mental objects. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These form the third Six.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have said there are six groups of Contacts; - <br />
					they are as follows: -<br />
					from sight and forms results ocular perception<br />
					and the meeting of these three is Contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The like happens<br />
					with each of the other five senses<br />
					and their sense-objects and perception combined. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fourth Six.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have said that there are six groups of feelings;<br />
					they are the classes of feelings<br />
					which severally arise as follows: -<br />
					from sight and forms<br />
					results ocular perception,<br />
					and the meeting of all three is contact,<br />
					from which contact come feelings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The like happens<br />
					with each of the other five senses<br />
					and their sense-objects and perception combined<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt282" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg282"><span class="f2">[282]</span></a>- This is the fifth Six.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have said there are six groups of cravings; -<br />
					they are the kinds of craving<br />
					which severally arise as follows: -<br />
					from sight and forms results ocular perception,<br />
					and the meeting of all three is contact,<br />
					from which come feelings<br />
					and out of feelings come cravings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The like happens<br />

					<p class="f4">If it be said the eye is Self,<br />
					that does not hold.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(For,) the arising<br />
					and the passing<br />
					of the eye<br />
					is manifest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But when anything manifestly<br />
					has its arising and its passing,<br />
					we are brought to this,<br />
					that Self arises<br />
					and then passes away again;<br />
					and therefore to say<br />
					the eye is Self<br />
					does not hold,<br />
					as the eye is thus non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The same argument applies to forms,<br />
					so that the eye and forms are non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It applies also to ocular perception,<br />
					so that the eye,<br />
					its sense-objects and ocular perception<br />
					are all three non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It applies also to ocular contact,<br />
					so that the eye,<br />
					its sense-objects,<br />
					ocular perception<br />
					and ocular contact<br />
					are all four non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It applies also to feelings,<br />
					<a id="pt288" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg288"><span class="f2">[288]</span></a> so that the eye,<br />
					its sense-objects,<br />
					ocular perception<br />
					and feelings<br />
					are all five non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It applies, lastly, to cravings,<br />
					so that the eye,<br />
					its sense-objects,<br />
					ocular perception,<br />
					feelings<br />
					and cravings<br />
					are all six non-Self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what applies to the sense of sight<br />
					applies equally to the other five senses, -<br />
					each with its sense-objects,<br />
					its perceptions,<br />
					its feelings,<br />
					and its cravings;<br />
					they are non-Self all of them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt284" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg284"><span class="f2">[284]</span></a> The way that leads to the origination<br />
					of the individuality view<br />
					is to regard as Mine -<br />
					or this is I -<br />
					or this is my Self -<br />
					either the eye,<br />
					or forms,<br />
					or ocular perception,<br />
					or ocular contact,<br />
					or feelings or cravings;<br />
					or similarly<br />
					to regard hearing<br />
					and the four other senses with their adjuncts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The way that leads to the cessation<br />
					of the individuality view<br />
					is not to regard as mine,<br />
					and so forth,<br />
					either eye<br />
					or hearing<br />
					or any of the four other senses<br />
					or their adjuncts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt285" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg285"><span class="f2">[285]</span></a> From sight and forms<br />
					arises ocular perception<br />
					and the meeting of all three is Contact,<br />
					from which contact come feelings,<br />
					pleasant<br />
					or unpleasant<br />
					or neither.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When experiencing a pleasant feeling,<br />
					a man rejoices in it,<br />
					hails it,<br />
					and clings tight to it;<br />
					and a trend to passion ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When experiencing an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					the man sorrows,<br />
					is miserable,<br />
					wails,<br />
					beats his breast<br />
					and goes distraught;<br />
					and a trend to repugnance ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When experiencing a feeling<br />
					that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant,<br />
					he has no true and causal comprehension<br />
					of that feeling's origin,<br />
					disappearance,<br />
					agreeableness,<br />
					perils<br />
					and outcome;<br />
					and a trend to ignorance ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It can never possibly result that -<br />
					without first discarding the pleasant feeling's trend to passion,<br />
					without first dispelling the unpleasant feeling's trend to repugnance,<br />
					without getting rid of the neutral feeling's trend to ignorance,<br />
					without discarding ignorance<br />
					and stopping it from arising -<br />
					he will put an end,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					to Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is true of sight<br />
					is equally true of each of the other five senses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt286" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg286"><span class="f2">[286]</span></a> From sight and forms arises ocular percep- <a id="pg318"><span class="f2 g"><b>[318]</b></span></a> tion<br />
					and the meeting of all three is Contact,<br />
					from which Contact come feelings,<br />
					pleasant or unpleasant or neither.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, when experiencing a pleasant feeling,<br />
					a man does not rejoice in it,<br />
					does not hail it,<br />
					does not cling tight to it; -<br />
					so no trend to passion ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, when experiencing an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					he does not sorrow,<br />
					become miserable,<br />
					wail,<br />
					beat his breast or go distraught; -<br />
					so no trend to repugnance ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, when experiencing a feeling that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant,<br />
					he has a true and causal comprehension of that feeling's origin,<br />
					disappearance,<br />
					agreeableness,<br />
					perils<br />
					and outcome; -<br />
					so no trend to ignorance ensues.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Inasmuch as he has already discarded<br />
					the pleasant feeling's trend to passion,<br />
					has already dispelled<br />
					the unpleasant feeling's trend to repugnance,<br />
					has already got rid of<br />
					the neutral feeling's trend to ignorance,<br />
					has already discarded ignorance<br />
					and fostered understanding, -<br />
					the result is that he will put an end,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					to Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is true of sight<br />
					is equally true of each of the other five senses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With vision such as this,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the Noble<br />
					is sick and weary of sight<br />
					and the other senses,<br />
					is sick and weary of their sense-objects,<br />
					is sick and weary of perceptions<br />
					and contacts<br />
					and feelings<br />
					and cravings, -<br />
					sick and weary of it all<br />
					<a id="pt287" href="../../pali/mn/mn.148.pali.bd.htm#pg287"><span class="f2">[287]</span></a> and so is Delivered;<br />
					and to him,<br />
					being Delivered,<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction that<br />
					this is his last birth,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there is now no more of what he has been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">While this discourse was being spoken,<br />
					the hearts of sixty Almsmen<br />
					were delivered from the Cankers<br />
					by leaving nothing to support them.</p>
