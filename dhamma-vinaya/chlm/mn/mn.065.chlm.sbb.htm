					<p class="f4">Once the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have only one meal each morning<br />
					and find that on this regimen<br />
					I am healthy and well,<br />
					buoyant,<br />
					hale<br />
					and hearty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do like me<br />
					and you too will benefit in the same way.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg312"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span></a> Hereupon, the reverend Bhaddāli told the Lord he could not do this, because, in so eating, he would be a prey to scruples and misgivings.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, Bhaddāli, eat a portion only at your place of entertainment<br />
					and take a portion away with you to eat later on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eating on this plan, <a id="pt438" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg438"><span class="f2">[438]</span></a> you will get along all right.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir, I could not do this,<br />
					because here too I should be a prey to scruples and misgivings.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, while the Lord was laying down a rule of conduct<br />
					and the Confraternity was vowing obedience,<br />
					the reverend Bhaddāli protested his inability<br />
					and for three whole months<br />
					never came near the Lord,<br />
					as one who was not conducting himself according to the Master's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of the time<br />
					a number of Almsmen were busied on making up robes for the Lord,<br />
					expecting that, when his robes were ready<br />
					at the end of the three months,<br />
					the Lord would set out on an alms-pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">To them came Bhaddāli<br />
					and seated himself after greetings,<br />
					to learn from them their expectation<br />
					and to be urged by them<br />
					to lay the Lord's monition to heart<br />
					lest worse should befall him hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accepting their advice, Bhaddāli betook him to the Lord<br />
					and after due salutation<br />
					took a seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I confess my fault, sir; -<br />
					foolish and misguided and wrong that I was<br />
					to protest my inability to conform<br />
					while the Lord was laying down a rule of conduct<br />
					and the Confraternity was vowing obedience thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the Lord to pardon my transgression as such,<br />
					with a view to my keeping watch and ward in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Bhaddāli; you did transgress,<br />
					foolish and misguided and wrong that you were<br />
					in protesting your inability to conform<br />
					while I was laying down a rule of conduct<br />
					and the Brotherhood was vowing obedience thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> You failed too to realize the circumstances, Bhaddāli.</p>

					<p class="f4">You failed to realize, firstly,<br />
					that the Lord was in residence at Sāvatthī<br />
					and would know you were not conducting yourself according to the Master's teachings;<br />
					secondly, that a number of <a id="pt439" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg439"><span class="f2">[439]</span></a> Almsmen - and of Almswomen too -<br />
					were spending the rainy season in the city<br />
					and would also know it;<br />
					thirdly, that in the city there were living a number of lay disciples - both men and women -<br />
					who would also know it;<br />
					and, fourthly, that there were a number of recluses and brahmins of divers schools<br />
					also spending the rainy season in the city,<br />
					all of whom would know that the Almsman Bhaddāli,<br />
					a senior disciple of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					was not conducting himself according to the master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">I confess my fault, sir; -<br />
					foolish and misguided ...<br />
					vowing obedience thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Bhaddāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who has found the twofold Deliverance,<br />
					both through the heart and the intellect.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I bid him make himself a bridge for me across the mire,<br />
					would he do so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he turn in a different direction,<br />
					or flatly refuse to do my bidding?</p>

					<p class="f4">He would not refuse, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of Almsmen<br />
					who have found Deliverance through the intellect -<br />
					or by comprehending the body -<br />
					or by sheer vision -<br />
					or by trust -<br />
					or by living up to the Doctrine -<br />
					or by living up to their trust.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I bid any one of these six<br />
					make himself a bridge for me across the mire,<br />
					would he do so?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would he turn in a different direction,<br />
					or flatly refuse to do my bidding?</p>

					<p class="f4">He would not refuse, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Bhaddāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">When this happened,<br />
					had you found the two-fold Deliverance <a id="pt440" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg440"><span class="f2">[440]</span></a><br />
					or any of the six other forms of Deliverance?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were you not at the time<br />
					empty and vain and blameworthy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">I confess my fault, sir;<br />
					foolish and mis- <a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> guided and wrong that I was<br />
					to protest my inability to conform<br />
					when the Lord was laying down a rule of conduct<br />
					and the Almsmen were vowing obedience thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Bhaddāli; you did transgress,<br />
					foolish and misguided and wrong that you were<br />
					to protest your inability ...<br />
					obedience thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, inasmuch as you see your transgression as such<br />
					and duly atone,<br />
					we pardon it unto you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It marks progress in the Rule of the Noble<br />
					when a man, seeing his transgression as such,<br />
					atones and keeps watch and ward over himself for the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman, Bhaddāli,<br />
					who does not conduct himself according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him comes the yearning to resort to some solitary habitation -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds,<br />
					in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open -<br />
					in the hope of realizing some height<br />
					of noblest knowledge or vision<br />
					transcending the ordinary.</p>

					<p class="f4">So to the solitary habitation of his choice<br />
					he betakes himself<br />
					and dwells aloof and alone there, -<br />
					contemned by his Master,<br />
					contemned by the judgment of the discreet<br />
					among his fellows in the higher life,<br />
					contemned by the local sprites,<br />
					and contemned by himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus universally contemned,<br />
					he fails to realize knowledge or vision<br />
					transcending the ordinary.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what comes to all<br />
					who do not conduct themselves<br />
					according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the case of an Almsman<br />
					who does conduct himself<br />
					according to the Master's teachings,<br />
					to whom comes the same yearning to resort to solitude<br />
					<a id="pt441" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg441"><span class="f2">[441]</span></a> with the same hopes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dwelling aloof there,<br />
					he is contemned neither by his Master,<br />
					nor by his fellows,<br />
					nor by the local sprites,<br />
					nor by himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not contemned of anyone,<br />
					he succeeds in realizing a height<br />
					of noble knowledge and vision<br />
					transcending the ordinary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					he develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy,<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation <a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what comes to all<br />
					who conduct themselves according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so in succession,<br />
					and for the same reason,<br />
					he develops and dwells in the Second,<br />
					Third<br />
					and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it is thus that he applies his heart<br />
					to the knowledge which recalls his earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single existence,<br />
					then two ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>)<br />
					... in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what <a id="pt442" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg442"><span class="f2">[442]</span></a> comes to one<br />
					who conducts himself according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to the knowledge<br />
					of the passing and re-appearance of other creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Celestial Eye ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>)<br />
					... and heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what comes to one<br />
					who conducts himself according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to the knowledge<br />
					of destroying the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has absolute comprehension of Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill;<br />
					he has the like absolute comprehension<br />
					of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and discerns this,<br />
					his heart is delivered from the Canker of sensuality,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his deliverance<br />
					in the confidence that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done,<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there is no more of what he once was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what comes to one<br />
					who conducts himself according to the Master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon Bhaddāli asked the Lord<br />
					what was the cause and reason<br />
					why the Almsmen prolong proceedings against one Almsman<br />
					longer than against another.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, answered the Lord,<br />
					of a frequent and habitual offender<br />
					who, when spoken to by his brethren,<br />
					<a id="pg316"><span class="f2 g"><b>[316]</b></span></a> skips off to something irrelevant,<br />
					changes the subject,<br />
					evinces rage and hatred and resentment,<br />
					does not take it well,<br />
					bristles with indignation,<br />
					fails to atone,<br />
					and does not declare himself willing to do<br />
					what the Confraternity pleases.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a case his brethren,<br />
					who have duly noted all this,<br />
					<a id="pt443" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg443"><span class="f2">[443]</span></a> deem it well<br />
					to conduct such an enquiry into his case<br />
					as to preclude any speedy settlement of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the case of another frequent and habitual offender<br />
					who, when spoken to by his brethren,<br />
					does not skip off to something irrelevant,<br />
					does not change the subject,<br />
					does not evince rage and hatred and resentment,<br />
					but takes it well,<br />
					is humble, atones, and declares himself willing<br />
					to do what the Confraternity pleases.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a case, his brethren,<br />
					who have duly noted all this,<br />
					deem it well so to restrict their enquiry into his case<br />
					as to ensure a speedy settlement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next take the case of a casual<br />
					and not habitual offender,<br />
					who, when spoken to by his brethren,<br />
					skips off to something irrelevant ...<br />
					<a id="pt444" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg444"><span class="f2">[444]</span></a> preclude any speedy settlement of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next take the case of a casual<br />
					and not habitual offender,<br />
					who, when spoken to by his brethren,<br />
					does not skip off to something irrelevant ...<br />
					ensure a speedy settlement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who gets along just by trust and affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognizing this,<br />
					his brethren deem it well not to protract the proceedings<br />
					lest he lose even his trust and affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man possessed only a single eye<br />
					and his friends and kinsfolk guarded that one eye of his<br />
					lest he should lose even that too, -<br />
					even so do the Almsmen take heed<br />
					lest he should lose even his trust and affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Bhaddāli, is the cause and the reason<br />
					why the Almsmen prolong proceedings against one Almsman<br />
					longer than against another.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, sir, is the cause and the reason<br />
					why in bygone days<br />
					<a id="pt445" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg445"><span class="f2">[445]</span></a> there were fewer rules of conduct<br />
					and more Arahats,<br />
					whereas nowadays there are more rules<br />
					and fewer Arahats?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg317"><span class="f2 g"><b>[317]</b></span></a> It is because, when men fall away<br />
					and the truth wanes,<br />
					rules are multiplied<br />
					and there are fewer Arahats.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Master does not prescribe rules for his disciples<br />
					so long as there is no sign in the Confraternity<br />
					of states of consciousness bred of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as soon as he sees signs of this,<br />
					he prescribes rules to combat those states of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such states occur only when the Confraternity has grown big,<br />
					and then it is that rules against them must be prescribed.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do not appear till the Confraternity has risen to wealth,<br />
					fame,<br />
					learning,<br />
					and standing;<br />
					but, when it has got standing,<br />
					then there occur states of consciousness bred of the Cankers<br />
					and the Master prescribes rules to combat them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Few were ye when I preached the homily with the parable of the thorough-bred Colt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you remember it, Bhaddāli?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what cause do you attribute that?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have not been conducting myself<br />
					according to the Master's teachings<br />
					for a long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is not the cause or the reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">For some time past<br />
					my heart has been fathoming yours,<br />
					seeing how, while I was expounding the Doctrine,<br />
					you, in your folly,<br />
					were not listening intently,<br />
					with grip and grasp and whole-hearted apprehension.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, I will tell you that homily<br />
					with the parable of the Colt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken and give ear<br />
					<a id="pt446" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg446"><span class="f2">[446]</span></a> and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Bhaddāli the Lord began thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an expert horse-breaker,<br />
					when a fine thoroughbred is put in his hands,<br />
					first schools it to the bit,<br />
					and during the process the colt exhibits<br />
					every twist, wriggle and contortion<br />
					you would expect from one constrained<br />
					to do something wholly novel,<br />
					until he is perfected by constant use<br />
					and gradual practice therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">After the bit comes the yoke<br />
					and in this process too the colt exhibits ...<br />
					practice herein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next the colt is schooled successively to the ring,<br />
					to being clipped,<br />
					to gallop,<br />
					to neigh (defiance),<br />
					to bear himself like a royal charger of birth and breeding,<br />
					peerless in speed,<br />
					in points,<br />
					and in <a id="pg318"><span class="f2 g"><b>[318]</b></span></a> manners;<br />
					and in this process too the colt exhibits ...<br />
					practice herein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, the horse-breaker grooms and braids the colt to perfection<br />
					and so it becomes with its ten points<br />
					a charger for a king to be proud of,<br />
					and is styled a royal treasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					an Almsman who has his ten points<br />
					grows worthy of oblations<br />
					and offerings<br />
					and gifts<br />
					and homage<br />
					and is the richest field in which to sow the seed of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are these ten points?</p>

					<p class="f4">His are the Arahat's right views,<br />
					the Arahat's right aspirations,<br />
					the Arahat's right speech,<br />
					the Arahat's right action,<br />
					the Arahat's right mode of livelihood,<br />
					the Arahat's right effort,<br />
					the Arahat's <a id="pt447" href="../../pali/mn/mn.065.pali.bd.htm#pg447"><span class="f2">[447]</span></a> right mindfulness,<br />
					the Arahat's right rapture of concentration,<br />
					together with the Arahat's right knowledge<br />
					and right Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman, Bhaddāli,<br />
					who has these ten points<br />
					is worthy of oblations<br />
					and offerings<br />
					and gifts<br />
					and is the richest field in which to sow the seed of merit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Bhaddāli rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Apparently he was afraid of not finishing his msal within the prescribed hours, and so of eating at the wrong time, <i>i.e.</i> after the meridian. (<i>Cf.</i> Vinaya Texts I, 40.)</p>
