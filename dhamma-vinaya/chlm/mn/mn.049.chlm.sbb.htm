					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">While I was staying once at Ukkattha<br />
					in the Subhaga grove<br />
					under the great sāl-tree,<br />
					Baka the Brahmā conceived the pernicious view<br />
					that his world was everlasting,<br />
					permanent,<br />
					eternal,<br />
					complete in itself,<br />
					with no rebirth thence;<br />
					that in his world there was no birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					rebirth thence,<br />
					or further existences,<br />
					nor was there any other salvation beyond it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reading his thoughts,<br />
					I vanished from beneath that sāl-tree<br />
					to reappear in his particular Brahmā-world, -<br />
					as readily as a strong man might stretch forth his bent arm<br />
					or draw back his outstretched <a id="pg235"><span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span></a> arm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing me coming some distance off,<br />
					Baka said-Come, your Excellency;<br />
					your Excellency is welcome indeed;<br />
					it is a long time since your Excellency managed to come here.</p>

					<p class="f4">This world is everlasting,<br />
					permanent ...<br />
					salvation beyond it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In answer I said:</p>

					<p class="f4">The worthy Baka the Brahmā is in error,<br />
					quite in error,<br />
					should he affirm<br />
					that the transitory is everlasting,<br />
					that the impermanent<br />
					has permanence,<br />
					that the temporal<br />
					is eternal,<br />
					that the incomplete<br />
					is complete;<br />
					that here is no birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					rebirth hence,<br />
					or further existences, -<br />
					when the exact opposite is the case;<br />
					or should he affirm<br />
					that there is no other salvation beyond this, -<br />
					when there is another salvation beyond it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereon Māra the Evil One entered into one of the Brahmā conclave<br />
					and said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsman! Almsman! forbear; forbear;<br />
					for this Brahmā is the Great Brahmā,<br />
					vanquisher and unvanquished,<br />
					all-seeing and all-subduing lord,<br />
					paramount disposer of life,<br />
					abiding for ever,<br />
					father of all creatures that are<br />
					or are to be!</p>

					<p class="f4">Before your time, Almsman,<br />
					the world has seen recluses and brahmins<br />
					who have scorned and contemned<br />
					earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					creatures,<br />
					gods,<br />
					Pajāpati,<br />
					and Brahmā; -<br />
					and these, at the body's dissolution,<br />
					when their lives were cut off,<br />
					have passed thereafter to mean existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before your time, Almsman,<br />
					the world has seen recluses and brahmins<br />
					who have lauded and revelled in earth ...<br />
					Brahmā; -<br />
					and these, at the body's dissolution,<br />
					when their lives were cut off,<br />
					have passed thereafter to excellent existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, I advise you<br />
					to conform to what Brahmā has told you<br />
					and not to be recalcitrant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should you be recalcitrant,<br />
					it will fare with you<br />
					as with a man who with a stick<br />
					tries to beat back the radiance which is enveloping him,<br />
					or who strains at the earth<br />
					for a foothold or handhold<br />
					as he is in act to fall into hell's maw.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conform to everything Brahmā has said,<br />
					and do not be recalcitrant.</p>

					<p class="f4">See you not, Almsman,<br />
					his hosts seated around?</p>

					<p class="f4">I rejoined:</p>

					<p class="f4">I know you, Evil One;<br />
					do not imagine <a id="pg236"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span></a> that I know you not.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are Māra, the Evil One;<br />
					you have got into your grasp<br />
					and into your power<br />
					Brahmā and Brahmā's host<br />
					and Brahmā's conclave;<br />
					and you think to get me too<br />
					into your grasp<br />
					and into your power; -<br />
					but I am not in your grasp, Evil One;<br />
					I am not in your power.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Baka the Brahmā said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">I, your Excellency, affirm<br />
					that the everlasting is everlasting,<br />
					that the permanent is permanent,<br />
					that the eternal is eternal,<br />
					that the complete is complete,<br />
					that freedom from rebirth hence<br />
					is freedom from rebirth hence;<br />
					I affirm that a realm exists<br />
					where there is no birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					rebirth thence,<br />
					or further existences, -<br />
					for, here is no birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					rebirth hence,<br />
					or further existences;<br />
					and I affirm that,<br />
					there being not any other salvation beyond this,<br />
					no other salvation exists.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before your time, Almsman,<br />
					the world has seen recluses and brahmins<br />
					who - for a term as long as the whole of your life -<br />
					have devoted themselves to austerities;<br />
					and they would know<br />
					whether or not there was another salvation beyond this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Almsman, I tell you that,<br />
					toil and moil as long as ever you will,<br />
					you will never find any other salvation beyond this.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you will recognize earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					creatures,<br />
					gods,<br />
					Pajāpati,<br />
					and Brahmā,<br />
					then will you become mine own,<br />
					reposing on me,<br />
					to do as I will,<br />
					and to be my elect.</p>

					<p class="f4">I too know, Brahmā,<br />
					said I,<br />
					that by recognizing earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					and the rest,<br />
					I should be yours as you say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, and also I know full well<br />
					how you have progressed to your pomp and state<br />
					as the mighty,<br />
					powerful,<br />
					and sovereign Baka the Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">What knowledge has your Excellency of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">The realms of sun and moon,<br />
					where'er their rays illumine, -<br />
					yea, a thousand worlds thy sway acknowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, -<br />
					is it thine to know the lot of beings good and bad,<br />
					their whence and where?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have this knowledge, Brahmā,<br />
					of your progress to your pomp and state<br />
					as the mighty,<br />
					powerful,<br />
					and sovereign Baka the Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></a> Now, there are three other planes of existence, Brahmā,<br />
					which you do not know or discern, -<br />
					though I do.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, there is the Ābhassara plane,<br />
					from which you came hither,<br />
					though your long residence here<br />
					has made you forget it<br />
					so that you do not know or discern it, -<br />
					as I do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, in higher knowledge,<br />
					I am not on a mere equality with you,<br />
					much less at a disadvantage; -<br />
					I have the advantage of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the Subhakiṇṇa plane<br />
					and the Vehapphala plane,<br />
					neither of which you know or discern, -<br />
					though I do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again, in higher knowledge,<br />
					I am not on a mere equality with you,<br />
					much less at a disadvantage; -<br />
					I have the advantage of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, Brahmā,<br />
					I have realized the earth to be the earth it really is<br />
					and have realized that something else<br />
					which is in no wise reached by earth's earthiness; -<br />
					no ideas occur of earth,<br />
					in the earth,<br />
					from the earth,<br />
					my earth;<br />
					nor do I pay homage to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again ...<br />
					advantage of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the like ... applies to water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					creatures,<br />
					gods,<br />
					Pajāpati,<br />
					Brahmā,<br />
					the Ābhassaras,<br />
					the Subhakiṇṇas,<br />
					the Vehapphalas,<br />
					the Vanquisher,<br />
					the All; -<br />
					no such ideas about them occur,<br />
					nor do I pay homage to any of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again ...<br />
					advantage of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">If that something else of your Excellency's<br />
					is in no wise reached by the all-ness of the All,<br />
					take heed it prove not merely empty and vain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, for instance,<br />
					which is invisible and boundless and all illumined,<br />
					is not reached by earths earthiness,<br />
					or by water's wateriness,<br />
					or by anything else in your list!</p>

					<p class="f4">And now I vanish from your Excellency's view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vanish if you can, Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, for all his protestations,<br />
					Baka could not vanish!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I told him that I would vanish from his sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Vanish, if you can, - said he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Almsmen, by the exercise of such magical powers<br />
					as would let Brahmā and his host and conclave hear me<br />
					without seeing me,<br />
					I disappeared,<br />
					repeating these lines:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Marking what dangers life beset, how life<br />
							still dogs the nihilist, no further court<br />
							paid I to life nor craved for life on life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Astounded at the marvel and wonder,<br />
					Brahmā with his host and conclave exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous and wonderful<br />
					is the magic power and might<br />
					of the recluse Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Never before was seen or reported<br />
					any other recluse or brahmin<br />
					of such power and might as GOtama,<br />
					the Sakyan who left his Sakyan home<br />
					to be a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">A generation that delights in living<br />
					and is given over to delighting and revelling in living,<br />
					has seen him grub and stub up existence by the roots!</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering now into one of Brahmā's conclave,<br />
					Māra, the Evil One, said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">If your Excellency has come to this knowledge<br />
					and to this enlightenment,<br />
					do not communicate it to followers or Pilgrims;<br />
					do not expound your Doctrine to them;<br />
					yearn not for followers or Pilgrims.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before you, there have been recluses and brahmins in the world<br />
					who, professing to be Arahats all-enlightened,<br />
					communicated and expounded their Doctrine<br />
					to the followers and Pilgrims for whom they yearned;<br />
					and the result of this has been that,<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					when their life was cut off,<br />
					they passed thereafter to mean existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before you, there have been recluses and brahmins in the world<br />
					who, professing to be Arahats all-enlightened,<br />
					refused to communicate and expound their Doctrine<br />
					to followers and Pilgrims,<br />
					for whom they had no yearning;<br />
					and the result of this has been that,<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					when their life was cut off,<br />
					they passed thereafter to excellent existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Almsman, I advise you not to trouble<br />
					but to live comfortably here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Silence is best;<br />
					do not preach to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">I rejoined:</p>

					<p class="f4">I know you, Evil One;<br />
					do not imagine that I know you not.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are Māra, the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is out of no goodwill,<br />
					but out of ill-will,<br />
					that you give me this advice, -<br />
					because you think that those to whom I preach my gospel<br />
					will pass out of your range.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg239"><span class="f2 g"><b>[239]</b></span></a> Though they professed to be all-enlightened,<br />
					those recluses and brahmins of yours<br />
					were not so; -<br />
					I profess to be all-enlightened, -<br />
					and am.</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, the truth-finder is one and the same,<br />
					whether preaching his Doctrine to followers or not,<br />
					whether communicating it or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in the truth-finder<br />
					all those Cankers which are of impurity,<br />
					which lead to re-birth,<br />
					entail suffering,<br />
					ripen unto sorrow,<br />
					leaving behind a heritage of birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death, -<br />
					all these have been grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					like a bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree grew,<br />
					things which once have been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Almsmen, was Māra's failure to cajole me<br />
					and Brahmā's appeal.</p>

					<p class="f4">So this homily's title is Brahmā's appeal.</p>
