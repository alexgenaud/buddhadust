					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Gabled Hall in Great Wood,<br />
					there was living in that city Saccaka,<br />
					son of the Jain (woman),<br />
					a great controversialist,<br />
					who gave himself out as learned<br />
					and was held in high popular repute.</p>

					<p class="f4">He used to go about Vesālī, saying to people there:</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no recluse or brahmin -<br />
					founder of a Confraternity or following,<br />
					with followers to teach,<br />
					even though he be hailed as 'Arahat all-enlightened' -<br />
					who, when taken in hand by me<br />
					point by point,<br />
					would not fall a-trembling<br />
					and be all of a tremble,<br />
					and quake,<br />
					with the sweat streaming from his arm pits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, if I were to take in hand,<br />
					point by point,<br />
					an insensate post,<br />
					even that would fall a-trembling<br />
					and be all of a tremble<br />
					and quake, -<br />
					let alone a human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now early one morning the reverend Assaji,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into Vesālī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him coming some way off,<br />
					Saccaka, who was wandering up and down the city,<br />
					went up to him and,<br />
					after exchange of civil greetings,<br />
					stood to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the recluse Gotama train his disciples?</p>

					<p class="f4">In what divisions<br />
					does his teaching mostly run?</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise<br />
					and in the following divisions,<br />
					Aggivessana<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">Visible shape, Almsmen, is impermanent;<br />
					feeling is impermanent;<br />
					perception is impermanent;<br />
					the plastic forces are impermanent;<br />
					and consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no Self in visible shapes,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					or <a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">All plastic forces are impermanent,<br />
					and there is no Self in any mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise<br />
					and in those divisions<br />
					does the Lord's teaching mostly run.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I am sorry to hear that the recluse Gotama holds this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, some time or other,<br />
					I may meet your worthy Gotama<br />
					and have a talk with him;<br />
					I might wean him from those wrong views of his.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then five hundred of the Licchavis<br />
					were met together in their moot-house<br />
					on some business or other,<br />
					and to them came Saccaka, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come along, good Licchavis;<br />
					come along with me!</p>

					<p class="f4">To-day I am going to have a talk with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he takes up his stand against me<br />
					on the lines taken up<br />
					by his well-known follower, the Almsman Assaji, -<br />
					why, point by point,<br />
					I will shake him to and fro<br />
					and haul him about<br />
					even as a lusty fellow<br />
					would tug and haul about<br />
					a fleecy ram he had got by its fleece;<br />
					or, as a lusty brewer,<br />
					with his crate plunged into a deep pool of water,<br />
					would take it by its handles<br />
					and shake it to and fro<br />
					as he hauled it about;<br />
					or, as a brewer's lusty varlet,<br />
					holding his rinser by its handle,<br />
					would shake it up and down<br />
					and toss it about; -<br />
					even so, point by point,<br />
					will I shake up and down<br />
					and toss about the recluse Gotama;<br />
					or, as in a deep tank<br />
					a full-grown elephant in his prime<br />
					disports himself as with what is called<br />
					'the <a id="merry_washing">merry washing</a> day'<br />
					so will I disport myself with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">So come along, good Licchavis,<br />
					come along with me!</p>

					<p class="f4">To-day I am going to have a talk with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some Licchavis said Saccaka was bound to win;<br />
					but others said the Lord would triumph over the inflated Saccaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, with a following of five hundred Licchavis,<br />
					Saccaka came to the Gabled Hall in Great Wood,<br />
					and, finding a number of the Almsmen pacing up and down in the open air,<br />
					went up to them, asking -</p>

					<p class="f4">Where is the reverend Gotama at the present time?</p>

					<p class="f4">We should like to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> The Lord, was the answer,<br />
					is in Great Wood,<br />
					sitting under a tree<br />
					during the heat of the day, Aggivessana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon Saccaka,<br />
					with his great train of Licchavis,<br />
					went into Great Wood to the Lord,<br />
					and, after exchange of civil greetings,<br />
					took a seat to one side, -<br />
					as also did the Licchavis,<br />
					some after obeisance,<br />
					some after greetings,<br />
					some with joined palms outstretched in salutation,<br />
					some with mention of their names and clans,<br />
					and others again in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">From his seat Saccaka said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a small point<br />
					on which I should like to question the reverend Gotama,<br />
					if he will allow me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask, Aggivessana, whatever you will.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, then, does the reverend Gotama train his disciples?</p>

					<p class="f4">In what divisions does his teaching mostly run?</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise<br />
					and in the following divisions, Aggivessana:</p>

					<p class="f4">Visible shape, Almsmen, is impermanent;<br />
					feeling is impermanent;<br />
					perception is impermanent;<br />
					the plastic forces are impermanent;<br />
					and consciousness is impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no Self in visible shapes,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					or consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">All plastic forces are impermanent,<br />
					and there is no Self in any mental states.</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise<br />
					and in those divisions my teaching mostly runs.</p>

					<p class="f4">A comparison occurs to me, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray let us hear it, Aggivessana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as the growth, increase, and development<br />
					of every seed<br />
					and of all vegetation<br />
					depends always on the earth<br />
					and is based on the earth;<br />
					just as the accomplishment of all tasks involving strength<br />
					depends always on the earth<br />
					and is based on the earth; -<br />
					just the same is it<br />
					with an individual's material Self <i>(rūpatta)</i><br />
					which, because it is based on matter,<br />
					produces merit or demerit;<br />
					and the same applies to the individual Self<br />
					of feeling,<br />
					of perception,<br />
					of the plastic forces,<br />
					and of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you not affirm, Aggivessana,<br />
					that your material shape is your Self,<br />
					that your feelings are your Self,<br />
					that <a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> your perceptions are your Self,<br />
					that your plastic forces are your Self,<br />
					and that your consciousness is your Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, that is precisely what I do affirm; -<br />
					and so does this great gathering.</p>

					<p class="f4">What will 'this great gathering' avail?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, Aggivessana, confine yourself to your own argument.</p>

					<p class="f4">I affirm that my material shape is my Self,<br />
					that my feelings are my Self,<br />
					that my perceptions are my Self,<br />
					that my plastic forces are my Self,<br />
					and that my consciousness is my Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Aggivessana, I will here ask you a return question,<br />
					to which you will make such answer as seems good to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">What say you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would a Noble,<br />
					being an anointed King,<br />
					like King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					or like King Ajatasattu of Magadha,<br />
					the son of the Videha lady,<br />
					have power-within his own realm -<br />
					to put to death<br />
					or to mulct<br />
					or to exile<br />
					those of his own subjects<br />
					who deserve those respective punishments?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he would.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, even confederations<br />
					and federations such as the Vajjians<br />
					or Mallians<br />
					possess this power -<br />
					within their own realms -;<br />
					and of course a monarch like King Pasenadi<br />
					or King Ajatasattu,<br />
					possesses it;<br />
					he would have this power<br />
					and ought to have it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What say you, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you say your material shape is your Self,<br />
					have you the power to make it become,<br />
					or not become,<br />
					what you order?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On this Saccaka became silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Lord asked the question,<br />
					but still Saccaka was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer, said the Lord;<br />
					this is no time to be silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">If thrice a person is asked a doctrinal question by the Truth-finder<br />
					and answers not,<br />
					his skull is then and there cloven into seven pieces.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that moment (Sakka) the fairy of the thunderbolt, <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> grasping his iron thunderbolt<br />
					all afire,<br />
					all a-glow,<br />
					all a-blaze,<br />
					took his stand in the air over Saccaka,<br />
					to cleave his head into seven pieces<br />
					if he failed the third time<br />
					to return an answer to the Lord's question.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this fairy of the thunderbolt<br />
					was visible to the Lord<br />
					and to Saccaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">In dread and dismay,<br />
					with every hair on his body standing erect,<br />
					Saccaka - now seeking protection<br />
					and shelter<br />
					and refuge<br />
					with the Lord! - said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the reverend Gotama put his question to me,<br />
					and I will answer it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What say you, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">When you say your material shape is your Self,<br />
					have you the power to make it become,<br />
					or not become,<br />
					what you order?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think before you answer, Aggivessana;<br />
					for your former utterance<br />
					does not accord with your last,<br />
					nor your last<br />
					with the former.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar paragraphs about feelings, perceptions, the plastic forces, and consciousness.]</p>

					<p class="f4">What say you, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is material shape permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is that which is impermanent<br />
					an Ill or the reverse?</p>

					<p class="f4">An Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it proper to regard what is impermanent<br />
					and an Ill<br />
					and the creature of change,<br />
					as being mine,<br />
					or I,<br />
					or my Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar paragraphs about feelings and the rest.]</p>

					<p class="f4">What say you, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a man who so clings to Ill,<br />
					who has so gone over to Ill,<br />
					and who so cleaves to Ill,<br />
					that he regards Ill as mine,<br />
					I,<br />
					my Self, -<br />
					can he either of himself fathom Ill<br />
					or cast it out of his life?</p>

					<p class="f4">How could that be?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not the fact.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like, Aggivessana,<br />
					a man in need,<br />
					search<br />
					and quest of the best of timber,<br />
					who should go with a keen axe<br />
					into the forest<br />
					and there, seeing a great banana-tree,<br />
					straight and young and towering aloft,<br />
					should cut its roots through,<br />
					chop off its head,<br />
					and then <a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a> proceed to unroll the ensheathing leaves,<br />
					yet should never come on even second-rate timber,<br />
					much less on the best of timber; -<br />
					just in the same way,<br />
					when examined<br />
					and pressed<br />
					and interrogated<br />
					on your own statements,<br />
					you are found empty<br />
					and vain<br />
					and faulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you said to people in Vesālī was this:</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no recluse or brahmin -<br />
					founder of a Confraternity or following,<br />
					with followers to teach,<br />
					even though he be hailed as<br />
					'Arahat all-enlightened' -<br />
					who, when taken in hand by me<br />
					point by point,<br />
					would not fall a-trembling<br />
					and be all of a tremble<br />
					and quake,<br />
					with the sweat streaming from his arm-pits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, (you went on to observe)<br />
					if I were to take in hand,<br />
					point by point,<br />
					an insensate post,<br />
					even that would fall a-trembling<br />
					and be all of a tremble<br />
					and quake, -<br />
					let alone a human being.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from your brow<br />
					that the sweat has streamed down your robe on to the ground;<br />
					while I have no sweat at all on my body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so saying<br />
					the Lord bared his golden body<br />
					to the gaze of the assemblage.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Saccaka sat silent and upset,<br />
					with his shoulders hunched up<br />
					and with his eyes downcast,<br />
					much exercised in his mind<br />
					but finding no words to utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing Saccaka's sorry plight,<br />
					the Licchavi Dummukha said to the Lord<br />
					that a comparison occurred to him,<br />
					and, being bidden to state it, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a crab<br />
					in a pond near a village or township,<br />
					which is fished out on to dry land<br />
					by the neighbouring boys or girls<br />
					who with sticks and stones<br />
					break and smash and pound<br />
					each successive claw<br />
					that the crab thrusts forth in turn,<br />
					until, when all his claws have been broken, smashed and pounded,<br />
					the crab is unable to get to his pond as he used.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way the Lord has broken, smashed and pounded<br />
					Saccaka's every successive trick, wriggle, and squirm<br />
					until Saccaka can never again come to the Lord as a controversialist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go away, Dummukha! go away!</p>

					<p class="f4">I am conferring with Gotama,<br />
					not with you, said Saccaka, -<br />
					who went on to say to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let us pass from what I,<br />
					with many other recluses and brahmins,<br />
					have said on these <a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> lines, -<br />
					all so much idle chatter, methinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what respects, now,<br />
					does a disciple of yours<br />
					carry out your doctrines<br />
					and practise your teaching,<br />
					living by the Doctrine of his master<br />
					and of no one else,<br />
					beyond doubts and perplexities,<br />
					in confident assurance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, Aggivessana, of a disciple of mine<br />
					who sees in the plenitude of knowledge and reality<br />
					that no material shape whatsoever, -<br />
					past, present, or future,<br />
					internal or external,<br />
					gross or delicate,<br />
					lowly or choice,<br />
					far or near -<br />
					is mine,<br />
					or I,<br />
					or my Self;<br />
					and who sees the like<br />
					concerning feelings -<br />
					perceptions -<br />
					the plastic forces -<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the respects in which a disciple of mine<br />
					carries out my doctrines<br />
					and practises my teaching,<br />
					living by the Doctrine of his master<br />
					and of no one else,<br />
					beyond doubts and perplexities,<br />
					in confident assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what respects does an Almsman become an Arahat, -<br />
					in whom the Cankers are no more,<br />
					who has greatly lived,<br />
					who has shed his burthen and won his weal,<br />
					who is no longer fettered to existence,<br />
					and who by utter knowledge<br />
					has won Deliverance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a Brother<br />
					who, from seeing,<br />
					in the plenitude of knowledge and reality,<br />
					that no material shape -<br />
					or feeling and so forth -<br />
					is mine or I, or my Self,<br />
					becomes Delivered in absolute emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the respects in which an Almsman becomes an Arahat ...<br />
					has won Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman whose heart is thus Delivered<br />
					possesses three excellences, -<br />
					excellence in vision,<br />
					excellence in practice,<br />
					excellence in Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Delivered,<br />
					he pays to the Truth-finder alone<br />
					honour and reverence,<br />
					devotion and worship,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Enlightened himself,<br />
					the Lord preaches the doctrine for enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Self-controlled himself,<br />
					the Lord preaches the doctrine for self control.</p>

					<p class="f4">At peace himself,<br />
					the Lord preaches the doctrine for finding peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having crossed the flood himself,<br />
					he preaches the doctrine for crossing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Winner of Nirvana for himself,<br />
					he preaches to others the doctrine for winning Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">This said, Saccaka said to the Lord:-</p>

					<p class="f4">I was <a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> arrogant and presumptuous<br />
					to imagine that, point by point,<br />
					I could cope with the reverend Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man might perhaps face with impunity<br />
					a rutting elephant, -<br />
					but not the reverend Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">With impunity perhaps<br />
					a man might face a blazing conflagration, -<br />
					but not the reverend Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">With impunity perhaps<br />
					a man might face a deadly venomous snake, -<br />
					but not the reverend Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; I was arrogant and presumptuous<br />
					to imagine that, point by point,<br />
					I could cope with the reverend Gotama, -<br />
					who, I beg,<br />
					will, with the Confraternity,<br />
					take his meal with me to-morrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">By his silence the Lord intimated his assent,<br />
					whereupon Saccaka informed the Licchavis<br />
					and asked them to make due provision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, when night had passed away,<br />
					they furnished him with five hundred cauldrons of boiled rice as a gift;<br />
					and Saccaka made ready in his pleasaunce<br />
					an excellent meal of food<br />
					both hard and soft,<br />
					and sent word to the Lord that the repast was now ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thither in the morning came the Lord,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					and sat down on the seat set for him,<br />
					he and the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with his own hands<br />
					Saccaka served the Confraternity,<br />
					headed by the Buddha,<br />
					with that excellent meal<br />
					without stint<br />
					till all had eaten their fill,<br />
					after which he sat himself down<br />
					on a lower seat to one side of the Lord, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">May the merit of this gift,<br />
					and of this field for reaping merit,<br />
					bring welfare to the donors!</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto them, Aggivessana,<br />
					shall accrue whatsoever merit attaches<br />
					to a recipient of gifts like yourself -<br />
					not free from passion, hate, and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto thee shall accrue<br />
					whatsoever merit attaches<br />
					to a recipient like myself<br />
					who am free from passion, hate, and delusion.</p>
