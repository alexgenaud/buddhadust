					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Lomasakangiya was living in the Sakyan country<br />
					at Kapilavatthu<br />
					in the Banyan grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him came the god Candana<br />
					in his surpassing beauty<br />
					who, as night waned,<br />
					illumined all the grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side,<br />
					the god Candana asked the venerable Lomasakangiya<br />
					whether he knew by heart<br />
					the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir, I do not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Brother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you know the verses?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir, I do not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, I know the verses.</p>

					<p class="f4">How do they run?</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, Almsman, when the Lord was staying with the Thirty-Three gods<br />
					at the foot of the Coral-tree<br />
					by the Gem-throne (of Sakkha),<br />
					he gave the exposition and analysis of the True Saint,<br />
					repeating the lines -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is my version of the True Saint verses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Study, learn and master<br />
					the exposition and analysis of the True Saint;<br />
					it is fruitful for good<br />
					and is fundamental for the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">With these words<br />
					the god Candana vanished from sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">When night had passed away,<br />
					Lomasakangiya packed up his bedding and set out,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					on an alms-pilgrimage to Sāvatthī,<br />
					<a id="pt201" href="../../pali/mn/mn.134.pali.bd.htm#pg201"><span class="f2">[201]</span></a> and in the pleasaunce there found the Lord<br />
					to whom, after due salutations,<br />
					he related all that had passed between him and the god,<br />
					ending with the request<br />
					that the Lord would teach him<br />
					the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> Do you know, Almsman,<br />
					who the god was?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was the god Candana,<br />
					who listens to the Doctrine<br />
					with the closest attention<br />
					that his heart and mind can give it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen then with attention<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, was the Almsman's dutiful response;<br />
					and the Lord began: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, Almsmen, does a man hark back to the past? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By finding delight in remembering<br />
					that in a previous birth in the past<br />
					such and such was he like,<br />
					such and such were his feelings,<br />
					his perceptions,<br />
					his plastic forces<br />
					and his mentality.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does a man not hark back? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By not finding delight in such memories.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does a man have longings for the future? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By <a id="pg262"><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></a> finding delight in the longing<br />
					that in later births in the future<br />
					he may be such and such,<br />
					with such and such feelings and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does a man not have longings for the future? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By not finding delight in any such aspirations.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is a man swept away by present states of consciousness? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed everyday man<br />
					who has no vision of the Noble Ones<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who has no vision of the Excellent Ones<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine; -<br />
					such a man either conceives<br />
					Form as Self,<br />
					or Self as having Form,<br />
					or Form in Self,<br />
					or Self in Form; -<br />
					and so on with feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					the plastic forces<br />
					<a id="pt189" href="../../pali/mn/mn.131.pali.bd.htm#pg189"><span class="f2">[189]</span></a> and the mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a man is swept away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is a man not swept away<br />
					by present states of consciousness? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an instructed disciple of the Noble Ones,<br />
					who has vision of the Noble<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who has vision of the Excellent<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine; -<br />
					such a man neither conceives<br />
					Form as Self,<br />
					nor Self as having Form,<br />
					nor Form in Self,<br />
					nor Self in Form;<br />
					nor does he entertain like conceptions<br />
					about feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					the plastic forces,<br />
					or the mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how a man is not swept away by present States of consciousness.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt202" href="../../pali/mn/mn.134.pali.bd.htm#pg202"><span class="f2">[202]</span></a> Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Lomasakangiya rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
