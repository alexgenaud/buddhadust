					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#nalanda">Nāḷanda</a> in Pāvārika's mango-grove, Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha was at Nāḷanda with a great following of Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his round for alms in the city,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī, having finished his meal,<br />
					betook him to the grove where the Lord was,<br />
					<a id="pt0" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg0"><span class="f2">[372]</span></a> and there after courteous greetings<br />
					stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he stood, the Lord said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is sitting room, Tapassī;<br />
					be seated, if you will.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Nigaṇṭha sat down on a low seat<br />
					and was addressed by the Lord as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">How many kinds of acts, Tapassī,<br />
					effect and start Demerit,<br />
					according to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not his usage, Gotama,<br />
					to employ the term acts;<br />
					he speaks of inflictions (<i>daṇḍa</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>).</p>

					<p class="f4">How many kinds of inflictions,<br />
					according to him,<br />
					effect and start Demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, Gotama, -<br />
					those of deed,<br />
					word,<br />
					and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these three distinct<br />
					each from the other two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of the three kinds<br />
					in this classification<br />
					does Nātaputta declare to be the most criminal<br />
					in effecting and starting Demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of deed, -<br />
					the other two being less criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of deed you say, Tapassī?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of deed you say?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of deed you say?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg268"><span class="f2 g"><b>[268]</b></span></a> In this wise<br />
					did the Lord three times<br />
					pin the Nigaṇṭha down to the issue.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt373" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg373"><span class="f2">[373]</span></a> At this point Dīgha Tapassī the Nigaṇṭha said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">And how many kinds of inflictions,<br />
					according to you, Gotama,<br />
					effect and start Demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not the Truth-finders usage, Tapassī,<br />
					to employ the term inflictions;<br />
					he speaks of acts.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many kinds of acts,<br />
					according to you,<br />
					effect and start Demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, Tapassī, -<br />
					those of deed,<br />
					word,<br />
					and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are these three distinct<br />
					each from the other two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of the three kinds<br />
					in this classification<br />
					do you declare to be the most criminal, Gotama,<br />
					in effecting and starting Demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of mind, -<br />
					the other two being less criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of mind you say, Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of mind you say?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of mind you say?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this wise did Dīgha Tapassī the Nigaṇṭha<br />
					pin the Lord down to the issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he rose up and went off to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					who was sitting among a large gathering of lay-folk<br />
					from the village of Balaka (noodle)<br />
					with Upāli at their head.</p>

					<p class="f4">When Nātaputta saw Dīgha Tapassī a little way off,<br />
					he asked where he had come from in the heat of the day<br />
					and was told he had been with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Asking next whether he had had a talk with him,<br />
					<a id="pt374" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg374"><span class="f2">[374]</span></a><br />
					and learning that he had,<br />
					Nātaputta enquired what had been their topic.</p>

					<p class="f4">On being told the whole conversation, Nātaputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Tapassī; quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">You answered Gotama like a well-informed disciple<br />
					who understands his master's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, what show can minds infliction make<br />
					as compared with the stupendous inflictions of deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; the inflictions of deed<br />
					are the most criminal<br />
					in effecting and starting Demerit, -<br />
					those of word and mind being less criminal!</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the householder Upāli at this point:</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Tapassī; quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">You answered Gotama like a well-informed disciple ...<br />
					less criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg269"><span class="f2 g"><b>[269]</b></span></a> now I am off<br />
					to refute Gotama on this issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he takes his stand with me<br />
					on the lines taken up by him<br />
					with the right reverend Tapassī,<br />
					then, point by point,<br />
					will I shake him to and fro<br />
					and haul him about ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.035.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 35</a>)<br />
					... <a id="pt375" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg375"><span class="f2">[375]</span></a> so will I disport myself with the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am off to refute him on this issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go then, householder,<br />
					and refute him on the issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">I or Dīgha Tapassī, or you can do that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Tapassī at this point:</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not like Upāli's going to refute Gotama,<br />
					who is a cozening person,<br />
					expert in seducing others' disciples over to himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is quite impossible and inconceivable, Tapassī,<br />
					that Upāli should go over to be a disciple of Gotama;<br />
					what is possible<br />
					is that Gotama will come over to be a disciple of Upāli!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go then, householder,<br />
					and refute him on the issue.</p>

					<p class="f4">I or Dīgha Tapassī, or you can do that.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time,Digha Tapassīand even a third timeDigha Tapassīdid Tapassī remonstrate, -<br />
					only to be met by the same rejoinder from Nātaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, I will go and refute him,<br />
					said the householder Upāli,<br />
					as he rose from his seat,<br />
					with salutations and profound obeisance to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					to betake himself to the Lord<br />
					in Pavarika's mango-grove.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt376" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg376"><span class="f2">[376]</span></a> Arrived there,<br />
					he made his salutations to the Lord<br />
					and took his seat to one side,<br />
					enquiring whether Dīgha Tapassī, the Nigaṇṭha had been there,<br />
					and whether he had had a talk,<br />
					and what it had been about.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been told by the Lord<br />
					all that had passed between them,<br />
					Upāli said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Tapassī, sir, was right, quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">His answer to the Lord<br />
					was that of a well-informed disciple<br />
					who understands his masters teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, what show can mind's infliction make<br />
					as compared with the stupendous inflictions of deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; the inflictions of deed<br />
					are the most criminal<br />
					in effecting and starting Demerit, -<br />
					those of word and mind being less criminal!</p>

					<p class="f4">If, householder, you were to speak<br />
					as one grounded in the Truth,<br />
					we might have a talk about it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg270"><span class="f2 g"><b>[270]</b></span></a> I will speak as one grounded in the Truth, sir;<br />
					let us have a talk about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a Nigaṇṭha<br />
					who, being sick and ill,<br />
					very ill indeed,<br />
					refuses cold water<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and will only take warm water,<br />
					so that he dies<br />
					in the act of refusing to touch cold water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where, according to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					will he be reborn next?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are gods, sir, called Mind's devotees;<br />
					and it is among these<br />
					that he is reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he dies in devotion to an idea.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder! householder!</p>

					<p class="f4">Take heed what you are saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">What went before<br />
					does not tally with what comes later,<br />
					nor does what comes later<br />
					tally with what went before.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet you represented you could speak<br />
					as one grounded in the Truth<br />
					and able to discuss it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Albeit the Lord says this, yet the inflictions of deed<br />
					are the most criminal<br />
					in effecting and starting Demerit, -<br />
					those of word and mind being less criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, <a id="pt377" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg377"><span class="f2">[377]</span></a> householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a Nigaṇṭha<br />
					who, being restrained with the restraint of the fourfold check,<br />
					resists evil with every form of resistance,<br />
					is absorbed in resisting evil,<br />
					has shaken off evil by resistance,<br />
					and is instinct with the spirit of resistance to evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that,<br />
					in going out or in coming in,<br />
					he destroys the lives of numerous tiny creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, according to Nātaputta,<br />
					is the result to which this ripens?</p>

					<p class="f4">He says it is unintentional<br />
					and therefore not criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if it be intentional?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it is criminal indeed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where does Nātaputta classify intention?</p>

					<p class="f4">In inflictions of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder! Householder! ... being less criminal.</p>

					<p><a id="pg271"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span></a> What think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this city of Nāḷanda rich and wealthy,<br />
					populous and crowded with folk?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose there came a man with a drawn sword<br />
					who declared that he would -<br />
					in an instant,<br />
					in a second -<br />
					make all Nāḷanda's living beings<br />
					into one heap<br />
					and one mass of flesh.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could he do it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, ten, or twenty, or thirty, or forty, or fifty men could not do it.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of a show<br />
					could one sorry individual make alone?</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose there came along a recluse or brahmin of super-normal powers<br />
					and psychic attainments<br />
					who said he would make Nāḷanda into a cinder<br />
					by a single paroxysm of mental wrath.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could he do it?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt378" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg378"><span class="f2">[378]</span></a> Yes, - ten, twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty Nāḷandas.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of a show<br />
					could one sorry Nāḷanda make alone?</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder ! Householder! ... being less criminal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you ever heard tell<br />
					who made the wildernesses of Dandaka and Kalinga and Mejjha and Matanga?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard it was done by sages' paroxysms of mental wrath.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder! householder!</p>

					<p class="f4">Take heed what you are saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">What went before<br />
					does not tally with what comes later,<br />
					nor does what comes later<br />
					tally with what went before.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet you represented<br />
					you could speak as one grounded in the Truth<br />
					and able to discuss it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was pleased and won over<br />
					by the very first of the Lord's illustrations;<br />
					it was only because I wanted to listen<br />
					to his nimble versatility in questioning<br />
					that I thought I must maintain a hostile attitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down ... <a id="pt379" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg379"><span class="f2">[379]</span></a> while life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Proceed circumspectly, householder;<br />
					it behoves well-known men like yourself<br />
					to be circumspect.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Still more am I pleased and won over<br />
					by the Lord's last remark.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, if those of other creeds had secured me as an adherent,<br />
					they would keep on parading their banner round Nāḷanda<br />
					to announce that I had joined them.</p>

					<p class="f4">But all the Lord does<br />
					is to counsel me to proceed circumspectly,<br />
					as it behoves well-known men like myself<br />
					to be circumspect!</p>

					<p class="f4">For the second time<br />
					I betake myself to the Lord as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity,<br />
					asking him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time, householder,<br />
					your family has been an unfailing well-spring for Nigaṇṭhas;<br />
					you will bethink you<br />
					to continue your alms to them<br />
					when they come to your doors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still more am I pleased and won over<br />
					by the Lord's last remark.</p>

					<p class="f4">What I had heard<br />
					was that you had laid it down<br />
					that gifts were to be given exclusively to you<br />
					and your disciples<br />
					but never to others<br />
					and their disciples,<br />
					and that, while there was an abundant blessing<br />
					on what was bestowed on you and yours,<br />
					no blessing on what was bestowed elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, now the Lord is urging me<br />
					to include the Nigaṇṭhas as well<br />
					in my bounty, -<br />
					a matter in which I shall observe the proper occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the third time I betake myself ... while life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord delivered a progressive discourse to Upāli,<br />
					namely, on giving,<br />
					on virtue,<br />
					on heaven,<br />
					on the perils of<br />
					vanity<br />
					and foulness<br />
					of pleasures of sense,<br />
					and on the gains to be won<br />
					by renouncing worldly things.</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as the Lord recognized<br />
					Upāli's heart to have become <a id="pt380" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg380"><span class="f2">[380]</span></a> sound<br />
					and malleable<br />
					and free from the Hindrances,<br />
					uplifted and believing,<br />
					then he unfolded the exposition of the Doctrine<br />
					which only the Enlightened have elaborated, -<br />
					regarding Ill<br />
					and its origin<br />
					and its cessation<br />
					and the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as spotless cloth<br />
					without speck or stain<br />
					will readily take the dye,<br />
					even so, while he was sitting there,<br />
					did the householder Upāli<br />
					come by the pure and spotless Eye Of Truth<br />
					so that he realized how<br />
					whatsoever has a <a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> beginning<br />
					must have an end.</p>

					<p class="f4">When that he had thus seen,<br />
					won, grasped, and penetrated the Doctrine,<br />
					when he had passed beyond all doubt<br />
					and had left all questionings behind him,<br />
					when certitude was his<br />
					and a direct personal conviction in the Masters teachings, -<br />
					Upāli said to the Lord<br />
					that now he must begoing,<br />
					as he had much to do and attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">At your own good time, answered the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then with grateful thanks to the Lord,<br />
					Upāli rose,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and with profound obeisance<br />
					betook himself to his own abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arrived there,<br />
					he said to the porter:</p>

					<p class="f4">From to-day onward<br />
					I close my doors to male and female Nigaṇṭhas;<br />
					they are open only to men and women<br />
					who are the Lord's disciples<br />
					or lay-followers.</p>

					<p class="f4">If any Nigaṇṭha comes here,<br />
					stop him and don't let him in,<br />
					but tell him that I have from to-day<br />
					gone over to be a follower of the recluse Gotama;<br />
					that I have closed my doors to male and female Nigaṇṭhas;<br />
					that my doors are open only<br />
					to men and women who are the Lord's disciples<br />
					or lay-followers;<br />
					and that, if he wants alms,<br />
					he should stop where he is<br />
					and it will be brought to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Very good, sir,<br />
					replied the porter to his master Upāli.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it reached the ears of the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī,<br />
					that Upāli had gone over to be a follower of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					away he went to Nātaputta with the news.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is quite impossible, Tapassī,<br />
					said Nātaputta,<br />
					that this could happen;<br />
					what is possible<br />
					is for the recluse Gotama to go over<br />
					to be a disciple of the householder Upāli.</p>

					whether or no Upāli has gone over?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, do, said Nātaputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Tapassī betook him to Upāli's abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him coming some way off,<br />

					but that, if Tapassī wanted alms,<br />
					he should stop where he was<br />
					and food would be brought to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir; I do not want alms, rejoined Tapassī,<br />
					who then turned back to Nātaputta<br />
					and reported that as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is quite true, sir,<br />
					that Upāli has gone over to Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">I told you I did not like the idea of Upāli's going to refute Gotama -<br />

					<p class="f4">It is quite impossible and inconceivable, Tapassī,<br />

					is that Gotama will come over to be a disciple of Upāli.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time,<br />
					and yet a third time,<br />
					did Tapassī repeat his statement,<br />
					only to be answered as before by Nātaputta,<br />
					<a id="pt382" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg382"><span class="f2">[382]</span></a> - who at last added<br />
					that he would go and ascertain for himself<br />
					whether or no Upāli had gone over.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Nātaputta betook him<br />
					with a large train of Nigaṇṭhas<br />
					to Upāli's abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him coming some way off,<br />
					Upāli's porter ... food would be brought him.</p>

					<p class="f4">My good porter,<br />
					go to the householder Upāli<br />
					and tell him that Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha<br />
					with a large train of Nigaṇṭhas<br />
					is standing in the gateway to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said the porter and took the message to his master,<br />
					who directed him to put seats in the hall<br />
					by the middle door of the house.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been duly done<br />
					and reported to him,<br />
					Upāli <a id="pt383" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg383"><span class="f2">[383]</span></a> proceeded to that hall<br />
					and sat himself on the finest, best, and choicest seat there,<br />
					telling the porter now<br />
					to tell Nātaputta he could come in if he wanted to.</p>

					<p class="f4">This message having been faithfully conveyed to him,<br />
					Nātaputta made his way into the hall<br />
					with his large train of Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he saw Nātaputta advancing,<br />
					the <a id="pg275"><span class="f2 g"><b>[275]</b></span></a> householder Upāli went to meet him<br />
					and invite him to be seated,<br />
					ostentatiously dusting with his robe<br />
					the finest, best, and choicest seat,<br />
					and then promptly sitting down on it himself -<br />
					as he said to Nātaputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are seats available, sir;<br />
					be seated, if you will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereon Nātaputta said to Upāli:</p>

					<p class="f4">You are a dolt and a dullard, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">After proclaiming that you would go and refute the recluse Gotama,<br />
					you retired from the encounter in great discomfiture.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you sallied forth<br />
					you were going to refute Gotama<br />
					and to return triumphant<br />
					like a gelder who successfully returns with a pair of testicles removed<br />
					or the gouger who returns with a pair of eyeballs excised; -<br />
					instead of which you retire from the encounter<br />
					in great discomfiture yourself,<br />
					cozened by Gotama's wizardry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir, and lovely<br />
					is that wizardry of his!</p>

					<p class="f4">Were my dear kith and kin but cozened by that same wizardry,<br />
					it would be to their abiding weal and welfare too!</p>

					<p class="f4">If all Nobles were so cozened,<br />
					it would be to their abiding <a id="pt384" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg384"><span class="f2">[384]</span></a> weal and welfare too, -<br />
					as also it would be for all brahmins<br />
					and middle-class men<br />
					and peasants too,<br />
					yea for all the world,<br />
					with its gods, Māras, Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind!</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, I will give you an illustration;<br />
					for, an illustration often helps an intelligent person<br />
					to understand the meaning of what is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time, sir,<br />
					there was an old and aged brahmin,<br />
					well advanced in years,<br />
					who had a young brahmin wife<br />
					who was with child<br />
					and nearing her confinement.</p>

					<p class="f4">She besought her husband<br />
					to buy in the bazaar, and bring home,<br />
					a young monkey to amuse her child.</p>

					<p class="f4">You had better wait, my dear,<br />
					replied the brahmin,<br />
					till your baby has been born.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, if it is a boy,<br />
					I will buy you a young male monkey<br />
					for him to play with,<br />
					or a young female monkey,<br />
					if you have a girl.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the wife pressed her request<br />
					and a second time got the same answer from her husband.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when she asked him a third time,<br />
					he, because of <a id="pg276"><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></a> his passion for his young wife,<br />
					went away to the bazaar<br />
					and bought a young male monkey<br />
					which <a id="pt385" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg385"><span class="f2">[385]</span></a> he presented to his wife<br />
					for her baby boy to play with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now go, said she,<br />
					to Ratta-pāṇi the dyer<br />
					and tell him you want this young monkey dyed a bright yellow,<br />
					thoroughly pressed all over,<br />
					and suppled both inside and out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of his passion for his young wife,<br />
					the brahmin took the monkey to the dyer's<br />
					and asked that all this should be done, -<br />
					only to receive the answer that,<br />
					though the monkey could be dyed,<br />
					it could not stand being pressed and suppled.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same, sir,<br />
					with the doctrine of the foolish Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					which will take colour from fools<br />
					though not from the wise,<br />
					but will not stand practice or suppling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on, sir, that same brahmin<br />
					came to that dyer with a couple of lengths of new cloth<br />
					to be dyed a bright yellow,<br />
					thoroughly pressed all over,<br />
					and suppled both inside and out.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the dyer told him<br />
					that his new cloth could not only be dyed<br />
					but also pressed and suppled inside and out.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same, sir,<br />
					with the Doctrine of the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					which will not only take colour -<br />
					from the wise,<br />
					though not from fools -<br />
					but will also stand practice and suppling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Householder, this gathering,<br />
					including the rulers present,<br />
					was under the impression you were a follower of Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whose follower are we to consider you?</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the householder Upāli<br />
					arose from his seat<br />
					and, with his outer robe over one shoulder<br />
					and the other bared,<br />
					<a id="pt386" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg386"><span class="f2">[386]</span></a> stretched forth folded palms of obeisance<br />
					in the direction where the Lord was,<br />
					and said to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha:</p>

					<p class="f4">Hear then whose follower I am!</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, high Wisdoms faultless lord,<br />
							whose mind is till'd, triumphant o'er his foes,<br />
							purged of besetting Ill, stedfast in poise,<br />
							in virtue stablished, wisest of the wise,<br />
							trampling down passion, Lord immaculate.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg277"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span></a> I follow him, whose tranquil mind serene,<br />
							by doubts untroubled, earthly joys disdains,<br />
							saintly and sainted, human, made like men,<br />
							yet peerless, Lord of utter purity.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, certain guide and sure,<br />
							foremost of teachers, matchless charioteer,<br />
							pride's potent queller, Victor, Lord of all.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him of boundless might, profound<br />
							in insight, bringing peace, in lore adept,<br />
							self-masterd, freedom's Lord emancipate,</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, who lives aloof, alone,<br />
							whose bonds are broken, who in freedom dwells,<br />
							error's refuter, spotless, meek, unstained<br />
							by passion, Lord of high self-mastery.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, of seven Sages last,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Being consummate, versed in threefold lore,<br />
							thoughts school'd accomplished master absolute,<br />
							potent Lord who storms the citadel.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him whose noble culture won<br />
							perfection, truth's exponent, quick to see<br />
							and store, - eschewing pleasure, not its thrall,<br />
							the Lord beyond all cravings, passion-free.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, the blameless, rapt in thought,<br />
							whose undefiled heart no trammels knows<br />
							nor bondage, void of littleness, detach'd,<br />
							consummate Lord who 0 er the Flood has passed<br />
							and pilots in his train mankind across.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him, th'unshackled, infinite<br />
							in wisdom, covetous of naught, who comes<br />
							to bless, Truth-finder without peer, the sole<br />
							and peerless, Lord of subtle mind abstruse.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I follow him of all-enlightend mind,<br />
							from cravings cleansed, unclouded, clear, undimmed,<br />
							<a id="pg278"><span class="f2 g"><b>[278]</b></span></a>  of meet oblations worthy,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> chief of men,<br />
							th'unequalled Lord of majesty supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, when, householder,<br />
					did you compose this eulogy of the recluse Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Like <a id="pt387" href="../../pali/mn/mn.056.pali.bd.htm#pg387"><span class="f2">[387]</span></a> a vast heap of divers flowers, sir,<br />
					from which a skilled garland-maker<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					might weave a garland manifold, -<br />
					even so in the Lord<br />
					there is full many a beauty,<br />
					yes, many hundreds of beauties,<br />
					to praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will refuse praise where praise is due?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then and there,<br />
					from the mouth of Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					who could not bear to hear the Lord extolled, -<br />
					there gushed hot blood.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Lit. stick, and so penalty. At <i>S.B.E.</i> XLV, pp. xvi-xvii, Jacobi suggests sins, while Jaini at p. xxxi of <i>Outlines</i> speaks of hurtful acts. <i>Bu.</i> here says the Jain idea was that <i>citta</i> (the <i>mano-daṇḍa</i>) did not come into bodily acts or into words, - which were irresponsible and mechanical, like the stirring and soughing of boughs in the wind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Jains do not drink cold water because of the <i>jīvas,</i> or souls in it. See <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.02.pali.bd.htm#pg74"><i>Dial.</i> 1, 74-5</a> for this and for what follows. <i>Bu.</i> explains <i>sabba-vāri-vārito</i> here not only with reference to cold water, but also (alternatively) as <i>sabbena pāpa-vāraṇena,</i> which is adopted in the translation <i>infra.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> See list of the seven Buddhas in the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14">14th Sutta of the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i></a> <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm#pg2">(Dial. II, 2-7).</a> This pioneer list was amplified later (<i>Jātaka</i> I, 44) by inventing eighteen extra predecessors for Gotama, so that he became the twenty-fifth. The Jain Mahāvīra had twenty-three predecessors.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> Indra or Sakka. The Buddhist commy. interprets this as Sakka who gave gifts in one earlier existence after another. <i>Cf.</i> Burlinghame's <i>Buddhist Legends,</i> Part I, p. 314.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Lit. a <i>yakkha</i> (or fairy) worthy to receive oblations, - the term <i>yakkha</i> being applied to Gotama here as it is applied to the great Sakka in <a href="mn.037.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 37.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Here, as elsewhere, the Buddhist Canon makes Nātaputta pre-decease Gotama. These symptoms, like those of the equally ascetic Devadatta, suggest rupture of the pulmonary bloodvessels. <i>Bu.</i> says here that Nātaputta was carried away on a litter to Pāvā, where he died shortly afterwards.</p>
