					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the mango-grove of Jīvaka Komārabhacca,<br />
					Jīvaka came to the Lord and, after salutations,<br />
					took his seat at one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I hear <a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> it is being said, sir,<br />
					that people slay animals<br />
					expressly for the recluse Gotama,<br />
					who wittingly eats meat<br />
					expressly meant for him<br />
					and deliberately provided for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, in so saying,<br />
					are people accurately quoting the Lord's own words<br />
					and not misrepresenting him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are they stating what is congruent with the Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">And is there no plausible version of your utterance<br />
					which provokes criticism?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt369" href="../../pali/mn/mn.055.pali.bd.htm#pg369"><span class="f2">[369]</span></a> Those who talk like that<br />
					are not accurately quoting words of mine, Jīvaka,<br />
					but are wrongfully misrepresenting me<br />
					in defiance of fact.</p>

					<p class="f4">I forbid the eating of meat in three cases, -<br />
					if there is the evidence<br />
					either of your eyes<br />
					or of your ears<br />
					or if there are grounds of suspicion.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in three cases I allow it, -<br />
					if there is no evidence<br />
					either of your eyes<br />
					or of your ears<br />
					and if there be no grounds of suspicion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, Jīvaka, of an Almsman,<br />
					supported by a village or a township,<br />
					who dwells with radiant goodwill<br />
					pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second -<br />
					a third -<br />
					and then the fourth quarter,<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world -<br />
					above, below, around, everywhere -<br />
					with radiant goodwill<br />
					all-embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					wherein no hate or malice finds a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this Almsman comes a householder<br />
					or his son<br />
					with an invitation to to-morrow's meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he so desires, the Almsman accepts,<br />
					and next morning,<br />
					when the night is over,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					he makes his way to the house,<br />
					takes the seat set for him,<br />
					and is served with an excellent meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">No thought comes to him<br />
					that he could have wished his host<br />
					either to desist now,<br />
					or to desist in future,<br />
					from furnishing so excellent a meal;<br />
					he eats his food without greed<br />
					or blind desire<br />
					but with a full consciousness of the dangers it involves<br />
					and with full knowledge that it affords no refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think that at such a time<br />
					that Almsman's thoughts are set on hurting himself,<br />
					or others,<br />
					or both?</p>

					<p class="f4">NO, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is not that Almsman then eating food<br />
					to which no blame attaches?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">I had heard that Brahmā's state<br />
					is one of good-will,<br />
					and now I have direct testimony of my own; -<br />
					for the Lord's state is one of good-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the truth-finder all passion,<br />
					<a id="pt370" href="../../pali/mn/mn.055.pali.bd.htm#pg370"><span class="f2">[370]</span></a> all hatred,<br />
					and all delusion<br />
					that could breed hurtfulness<br />
					have all been grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					like the cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree grew,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this was the purport of your remark, Jīvaka,<br />
					I agree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; that was what I meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman,<br />
					supported by a village or a township,<br />
					who dwells with radiant pity -<br />
					sympathy -<br />
					poised equanimity -<br />
					pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second - ...<br />
					food to which no blame attaches?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard that Brahmā's state<br />
					is one of poise.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have the testimony of my own eyes for the Lord<br />
					that his state is one of poise.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the truth-finder all passion,<br />
					all hatred,<br />
					and all delusion<br />
					which could breed annoyance<br />
					or dislikes<br />
					or aversions<br />
					have all been grubbed up ...<br />
					I agree.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt371" href="../../pali/mn/mn.055.pali.bd.htm#pg371"><span class="f2">[371]</span></a> Yes, sir;<br />
					that was what I meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso takes life expressly for the truth-finder<br />
					or for a disciple of his,<br />
					is storing up much demerit for himself in five respects.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, in that he orders a particular living creature to be fetched.</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, in that this living creature,<br />
					by being fetched,<br />
					experiences pain of mind and body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, in that he orders it to be killed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fourthly, in that, in being killed,<br />
					that living creature experiences pain of mind and body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And fifthly, in that he offends the truth-finder<br />
					or a disciple of his<br />
					by offering him what is improper.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Jīvaka Komārabhacca said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sir;<br />
					it is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">Strictly correct is the Almsman's eating,<br />
					strictly correct and blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir; excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again what had been cast down ...<br />
					I ask the Lord to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life lasts.</p>
