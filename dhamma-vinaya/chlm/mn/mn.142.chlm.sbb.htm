					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu<br />
					in the Banyan grove there,<br />
					Mahā-Pajāpatī the Gotamid came to the Lord<br />
					with two new lengths of cloth<br />
					which she begged the Lord<br />
					to be so good as to accept from her,<br />
					as being the work of her own hands at the loom<br />
					expressly for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To her the Lord made answer: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Give it to the Confraternity, Gotami,<br />
					and thereby show honour both to me<br />
					and also to the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second,<br />
					and a third time,<br />
					she repeated her request,<br />
					only to receive the same answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the reverend Ānanda to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray accept, sir,<br />
					the cloth from Mahā-Pajāpatī the Gotamid!</p>

					<p class="f4">She was of great service to the Lord<br />
					as nurse and foster-mother,<br />
					suckling her nephew<br />
					when his own mother died.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of great service to her too<br />
					has the Lord been; -<br />
					all through the Lord,<br />
 					<a id="pg300"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span></a> 					she has found refuge with the Buddha<br />
					and with his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity;<br />
					all through the Lord,<br />
					she keeps herself from taking life,<br />
					from taking what is not given her,<br />
					from lechery,<br />
					from lying<br />
					and from all manner of strong drink;<br />
					all through the Lord,<br />
					she has absolute faith in the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					and <a id="pt254" href="../../pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm#pg254"><span class="f2">[254]</span></a> is an embodiment<br />
					of all noble and lovely virtue;<br />
					and, all through' the Lord,<br />
					she has an unclouded belief in the Four Truths<br />
					of Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the path that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, the Lord has been of great service to her too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite so, Ānanda;<br />
					quite so.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, if a man has been led by a teacher<br />
					to find refuge in the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					the service rendered him<br />
					cannot be requited by salutations<br />
					or civilities<br />
					or by presents of robes and other requisites;<br />
					nor again are such things a recompense<br />
					for being led either to abstain from taking life,<br />
					stealing,<br />
					lechery,<br />
					lying<br />
					and strong drink,<br />
					or to have absolute faith in the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					or to have become an embodiment<br />
					of all noble and lovely virtue,<br />
					or to have an unclouded belief<br />
					in the Four Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Donations to individuals<br />
					are ranked in fourteen grades.</p>

					<p class="f4">First ranks giving to a Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat All-Enlightened;<br />
					second comes giving to a Pacceka-Buddha;<br />
					the third is giving to a Truth-finder's arahat disciples;<br />
					the fourth is giving to one<br />
					who is on the way to become a perfected arahat;<br />
					the fifth is giving to one<br />
					who will never be reborn on earth;<br />
					<a id="pt255" href="../../pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm#pg255"><span class="f2">[255]</span></a> the sixth is giving to one<br />
					who is on the way never to be reborn on earth;<br />
					the seventh is giving to one<br />
					who will return to earth only once more;<br />
					the eighth is giving to one<br />
					who is on the way to return to earth but once again;<br />
					the ninth is giving to one<br />
					who has entered the Paths;<br />
					the tenth is giving to one<br />
					who is on the way to enter the Paths;<br />
					the eleventh is giving to one<br />
					who, though outside our pale,<br />
					is superior to sensual pleasure;<br />
					the twelfth is giving to an ordinary but virtuous man;<br />
					the thirteenth is giving to an ordinary but non-virtuous <a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> man;<br />
					and the fourteenth is giving to those<br />
					who have been reborn as animals.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Ānanda,<br />
					the yield to be looked for<br />
					from a donation to an animal<br />
					is a hundred-fold,<br />
					to an ordinary non-virtuous man<br />
					a thousand-fold,<br />
					to an ordinary but virtuous man<br />
					a hundred-thousand-fold,<br />
					to him who,<br />
					though outside the pale,<br />
					is superior to sensual pleasure<br />
					a million-million-fold,<br />
					to the man who is on his way to enter the Paths<br />
					incalculable and beyond all measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What words can express it<br />
					for the higher stages?</p>

					<p class="f4">What words can express it<br />
					for a Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened?</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Donations to the Confraternity are seven.</p>

					<p class="f4">First among these ranks the donation<br />
					to both Almsmen and Almswomen<br />
					with the Buddha at their head;<br />
					second comes a donation<br />
					to both Almsmen and Almswomen<br />
					when the Buddha is no more;<br />
					third is giving to the whole body of Almsmen;<br />
					fourth to the whole body of Almswomen;<br />
					fifth <a id="pt256" href="../../pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm#pg256"><span class="f2">[256]</span></a> is to a fixed number<br />
					of selected Almsmen and Almswomen;<br />
					sixth to a fixed number<br />
					of selected Almsmen<br />
					and the seventh Confraternity donation<br />
					is giving to a fixed number of selected Almswomen.</p>

					<p class="f4">In days to come<br />
					there will be yellow-garbed members of this spiritual clan<br />
					without virtue and of bad dispositions,<br />
					to whom for the Confraternity's sake<br />
					gifts will be given.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even then, say I,<br />
					a donation to the Confraternity<br />
					is of incalculable and measureless worth;<br />
					but never, say I,<br />
					is a donation to an individual<br />
					more fruitful<br />
					than a donation to the Confraternity as a whole.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four degrees of purity in donations, -<br />
					there may be purity<br />
					(i) of donor but not of recipient,<br />
					(ii) of recipient but not of donor,<br />
					(iii) of neither, and<br />
					(iv) of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first of the four<br />
					is when the donor is a virtuous man of good dispositions,<br />
					while the recipients are without virtue<br />
					and of bad dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second is when<br />
					the donor is without virtue<br />
					and of bad dispositions,<br />
					while the recipients are virtuous men<br />
					of good dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> The third is when<br />
					both are without virtue<br />
					and of bad dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fourth is when<br />
					both donor and recipients are virtuous men of good dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt257" href="../../pali/mn/mn.142.pali.bd.htm#pg257"><span class="f2">[257]</span></a>	Thus spoke the Lord;<br />
					and the Blessed One,<br />
					as Master,<br />
					added the following: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When to th'unworthy pious virtue gives,<br />
							with grounded faith, what's rightly its to give,<br />
							then from the action fruit abundant grows.<br />
							- The gift is hallow'd here by him who gives.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When from th'unworthy pious virtue takes<br />
							what ne'er was theirs to give, nor have they faith,<br />
							still from the action fruit abundant grows.<br />
							- The gift is hallow'd here by him who takes.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When from unworthy hands th'unworthy take<br />
							what ne'er was theirs to give, nor have they faith,<br />
							still from the action fruit abundant grows.<br />
							- The gift is hallow'd here by neither side.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When pious virtue unto virtue gives,<br />
							with grounded faith what's rightly its to give,<br />
							then from the action fruit abundant grows,<br />
							- That gift, say I, bears overflowing fruits.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When pious Saint on Saint bestows as gifts,<br />
							with grounded faith, what's rightly his to give,<br />
							then from the action fruit abundant grows.<br />
							- The things thus given make a mighty gift.</p>
