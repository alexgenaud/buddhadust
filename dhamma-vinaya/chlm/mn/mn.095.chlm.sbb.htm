					<p class="f4">Once, in the course of an alms-pilgrimage through the Kosala country<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen,<br />
					the Lord came to a brahmin village of the Kosalans called Opasāda,<br />
					where he took up his abode<br />
					to the north of the village<br />
					in the sal-tree wood<br />
					where oblations are offered to deities.</p>

					<p class="f4">In Opasāda in those days lived the brahmin Cankī,<br />
					on a royal fief<br />
					granted to him outright<br />
					in full seignory<br />
					by King Pasenadi of Kosala, -<br />
					a demesne teeming with life<br />
					and abounding in grasslands,<br />
					woodlands,<br />
					water and cornlands.</p>

					<p class="f4">It came to the ears<br />
					of the brahmin heads of houses in Opasāda that,<br />
					that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					a Sakyan who had gone forth as a Pilgrim from a Sakyan family,<br />
					had come to their village<br />
					in the course of an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala,<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, they heard,<br />
					was the high repute noised abroad concerning the reverend Gotama<br />
					that he was said to be -<br />
					The Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind -,<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches a Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good to go and visit Arahats like him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So off to the wood<br />
					by the north approach<br />
					went the brahmins in companies and bands.</p>

					<p class="f4">They were observed by Cankī,<br />
					who had gone upstairs to lie down<br />
					during the heat of the day<br />
					in his verandah, -<br />
					and asked his confidant what it all meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being told they were all on their way to see Gotama,<br />
					he sent his confidant to ask them to wait for him<br />
					and he would come too to see Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the confidant <a id="pt165" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg165"><span class="f2">[165]</span></a> had duly delivered this message,<br />
					some five hundred brahmins<br />
					from divers parts<br />
					who were in Opasāda on some business or other,<br />
					at once went to Cankī<br />
					to ask if it was true<br />
					he was going to pay a visit to the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a> Yes, he told them,<br />
					it was, quite true<br />
					that he was going to Gotama with the others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not do so, said they to Cankī.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ought not to pay a visit to the recluse Gotama;<br />
					he ought to come and see you.</p>

					<p class="f4">On both your father's and your mother's side,<br />
					you are of pure descent<br />
					right back through seven successive generations<br />
					without break or blemish in your lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is one point<br />
					why you should not go to him<br />
					but he should come to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another point is that you are rich and wealthy,<br />
					with great substance.</p>

					<p class="f4">And another point is that you are versed in all three Vedas;<br />
					are accomplished in ritual<br />
					with all glosses thereon,<br />
					in phonology,<br />
					and in etymology,<br />
					with chronicles as a fifth branch;<br />
					know exegesis,<br />
					and are learned in casuistry<br />
					and in the signs that mark a Superman.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are handsome,<br />
					goodly,<br />
					well-liking,<br />
					of finest complexion,<br />
					perfect alike in complexion and stature,<br />
					and of noble presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are virtuous,<br />
					abundant in virtue,<br />
					in which you abound.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have a fine voice<br />
					and are a good speaker;<br />
					<a id="pt166" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg166"><span class="f2">[166]</span></a> your speech is urbane,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					unfaltering,<br />
					apt to express your meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have taught many a teacher of teachers<br />
					and have three hundred young brahmins<br />
					learning the runes from you.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are honoured and reverenced by the king of Kosala,<br />
					who shows you devotion and worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">You live on a royal fief,<br />
					<br />
					granted to him outright<br />
					in full seignory<br />
					by King Pasenadi of Kosala, -<br />
					a demesne teeming with life<br />
					and abounding in grasslands,<br />
					woodlands,<br />
					water and cornlands,<br />
					and this adds another point<br />
					why you should not go to Gotama<br />
					but he should come to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now listen to me, said Cankī,<br />
					and I will tell you why I ought to go to Gotama<br />
					instead of his coming to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">On both his mother's and his father's side,<br />
					Gotama is of pure descent<br />
					right back through seven successive generations<br />
					without break or blemish in his lineage.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is one point<br />
					why I should go to him<br />
					and not he to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">To go on Pilgrimage,<br />
					Gotama gave up great stores of gold,<br />
					wrought and unwrought,<br />
					buried away below ground<br />
					or housed in treasury chambers.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he went forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he was in the flush ofyouth and early manhood,<br />
					with a wealthof coal-black hair un- <a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> touched by grey,<br />
					and in all the beauty of his prime.</p>

					<p class="f4">He went forth on Pilgrimage,<br />
					despite his parents' wishes,<br />
					leaving them in tears and lamentation<br />
					when he cut off his hair and beard<br />
					and donned the yellow robes<br />
					to go forth from home to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama is handsome,<br />
					goodly,<br />
					well-liking,<br />
					of finest complexion,<br />
					<a id="pt167" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg167"><span class="f2">[167]</span></a> perfect alike in complexion and stature,<br />
					and noble of presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is virtuous,<br />
					abundant in virtue,<br />
					in which he abounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has a fine voice<br />
					and is a good speaker;<br />
					his speech is urbane,<br />
					distinct,<br />
					unfaltering,<br />
					apt to express his meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has taught many a teacher of teachers.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him all passion is dead;<br />
					frailty abides not in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches the consequences of acts<br />
					and the principles of action,<br />
					lauding the avoidance of evil<br />
					for righteous folk.</p>

					<p class="f4">He went forth as a Pilgrim<br />
					from an exalted and immemorial sept of Nobles,<br />
					rich and wealthy,<br />
					abounding in substance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From far realms and countries<br />
					men come to consult Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Many thousands of gods<br />
					have found life's refuge in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of him is the high repute noised abroad<br />
					that he is said to be the Lord,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is stamped with the two and thirty marks of a Superman.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him have Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha,<br />
					and Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					and the brahmin Pokkharasāti,<br />
					found life's refuge, -<br />
					they<br />
					and their wives<br />
					and their children.</p>

					<p class="f4">To Opasāda has the recluse Gotama come<br />
					and is now dwelling in our northern wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, all recluses and brahmins<br />
					who come within the precincts of our village<br />
					are our guests, -<br />
					to be treated with honour and reverence,<br />
					with devotion and worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">As our guest,<br />
					Gotama is to be so treated;<br />
					<a id="pt168" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg168"><span class="f2">[168]</span></a> and this is another count why I should go to him,<br />
					instead of his coming to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">This much know about Gotama's excellences;<br />
					but they do not end here,<br />
					for indeed they are beyond all measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">On each several count<br />
					it is not Gotama who ought to come to me,<br />
					but I who ought to go to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Conse- <a id="pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> quently,<br />
					we will all go together to visit the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, with a large company of brahmins,<br />
					Cankī came to the Lord and,<br />
					after exchanging,<br />
					greetings with him,<br />
					took his seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time the Lord was sitting down<br />
					after exchanging greetings with some old and aged brahmins;<br />
					and in the circle<br />
					sat a young brahmin named Kāpaṭhika,<br />
					a youth of sixteen<br />
					with shaven head,<br />
					who was versed in all three Vedas<br />
					was accomplished in ritual<br />
					with all glosses thereon,<br />
					in phonology,<br />
					and in etymology,<br />
					with chronicles as a fifth branch;<br />
					knew exegesis,<br />
					and was learned in casuistry<br />
					and in the signs that mark a Superman.</p>

					<p class="f4">This young brahmin broke in on the conversation<br />
					which these old and aged brahmins<br />
					were having with the Lord, -<br />
					who rebuked him<br />
					by saying that he should not interrupt his elders<br />
					but wait his turn when they had finished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the brahmin Cankī said to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not rebuke Kāpaṭhika, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes of a good stock,<br />
					is well-informed,<br />
					a good speaker,<br />
					and a scholar quite able to hold his own in the discussion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought the Lord to himself: -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt169" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg169"><span class="f2">[169]</span></a> This young brahmin will be sure to be a master of Vedic lore,<br />
					as the brahmins have such a high opinion of him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Kāpaṭhika to himself: -</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as I catch the eye of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					I will put a question to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reading with his own heart<br />
					the thoughts in the young brahmin's heart,<br />
					the Lord fixed his gaze in Kāpaṭhika's direction,<br />
					so that the latter,<br />
					feeling that he had secured the Lord's attention,<br />
					bethought him of putting his question<br />
					and accordingly said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching the runes<br />
					which have come down from brahmins of old<br />
					along the line<br />
					by unbroken oral tradition<br />
					and mastery of the Canon,<br />
					runes in which brahmins find an absolute certitude that<br />
					'here alone resides truth,<br />
					and everything else is vain,' -<br />
					what does Gotama say of them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me, Bhāradvāja; - is there among all brahmins<br />
					a single brahmin who claims that he personally<br />
					<i>sees and knows</i> that<br />
					'here alone resides truth,<br />
					and everything else is vain'?</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> No.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is that claim preferred by a single teacher<br />
					or teacher of teachers of brahmins<br />
					back to the seventh generation?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">Was that claim preferred<br />
					by those brahmin sages of yore<br />
					who composed and promulgated the runes<br />
					and whose compositions<br />
					are chanted<br />
					and repeated<br />
					and rehearsed<br />
					by the brahmins of to-day, -<br />
					such as Aṭṭhaka,<br />
					Vāmaka,<br />
					Vāmadeva,<br />
					Vessāmitta,<br />
					Yamataggi,<br />
					Angirasa,<br />
					Bhāradvāja,<br />
					Vaseṭṭha,<br />
					Kassapa<br />
					or Bhagu?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt170" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg170"><span class="f2">[170]</span></a> No.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					no claim personally to have seen and known<br />
					the absolute and exclusive truth of the runes<br />
					has been preferred<br />
					either by a single living brahmin<br />
					or by a single teacher of brahmins<br />
					for seven successive generations back,<br />
					or by those brahmin sages<br />
					who actually composed the runes<br />
					which are repeated by brahmins to-day.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a string of blind men<br />
					each holding on to his neighbour,<br />
					the first of whom cannot see,<br />
					nor can the one in the middle,<br />
					nor can the hindermost.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a string of blind men, methinks,<br />
					exemplifies the brahmin tradition, -<br />
					wherein the first never saw,<br />
					nor did the one in the middle see,<br />
					nor does the last.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me, Bhāradvāja;<br />
					is not the brahmins' belief groundless,<br />
					on this showing?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not faith alone<br />
					which inspires brahmins<br />
					but also the tradition they have inherited.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the outset you based yourself on faith, Bhāradvāja;<br />
					now you are shifting to authority. -</p>

					<p class="f4">There are five separate states of consciousness,<br />
					each with its own alternative outcome;<br />
					and the five are as follows: -<br />
					faith,<br />
					inclination,<br />
					authority,<br />
					appreciation and intellectual enthusiasm.</p>

					<p class="f4">A thing may either evoke faith in abundance<br />
					but yet in itself prove empty,<br />
					vain and false;<br />
					or,<br />
					it may fail to inspire faith<br />
					but yet in itself prove real,<br />
					veritable and sure.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same may <a id="pt171" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg171"><span class="f2">[171]</span></a> apply to inclination,<br />
					authority,<br />
					appreciation<br />
					and intellectual enthusiasm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maintenance of a truth<br />
					does not entitle an intelligent man to aver<br />
					that here alone resides all truth<br />
					and that everything else is vain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> What is the scope of this maintenance of truth<br />
					and of his maintenance thereof?</p>

					<p class="f4">I invite the reverend Gotama<br />
					to enlarge on the maintenance of truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man has faith,<br />
					then in his profession of faith<br />
					he maintains the truth he has<br />
					but does not claim absolutely<br />
					that this is all truth<br />
					and that everything else is vain;<br />
					or if he has inclination and the rest,<br />
					and, while professing what he has got,<br />
					does not claim that this is all truth<br />
					and that everything else is vain; -<br />
					then, within this scope,<br />
					there is maintenance of truth<br />
					and he maintains truth,<br />
					as I affirm;<br />
					but this does not give him enlightenment in truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I quite follow. -</p>

					<p class="f4">And now as to enlightenment in truth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman,<br />
					supported by a village or township,<br />
					to whom there comes the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					to scan him with regard to <a id="pt172" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg172"><span class="f2">[172]</span></a> greed,<br />
					malevolence<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The visitor wonders<br />
					whether the reverend man's heart<br />
					harbours such greed<br />
					as to make him profess either to know<br />
					when he does not know,<br />
					or to see<br />
					when he does not see,<br />
					or to egg another on<br />
					to do what would conduce<br />
					to the lasting harm and hurt of other people.</p>

					<p class="f4">Convinced by his scrutiny<br />
					that no such greed is harboured in that Almsman's heart,<br />
					he concludes that his behaviour in action and in speech<br />
					proclaims him void of greed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, the Doctrine the Almsman preaches<br />
					is profound,<br />
					recondite,<br />
					hard to comprehend,<br />
					serene,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					only to be understood by the instructed,<br />
					and incapable of being preached by a greedy man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Convinced on this first point,<br />
					he proceeds to consider<br />
					whether the reverend man's heart harbours malevolence<br />
					or <a id="pt178" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg178"><span class="f2">[178]</span></a> delusion;<br />
					and is similarly convinced by his scrutiny<br />
					that the Almsman is neither wicked nor wrong-headed,<br />
					or he could not preach as he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">With this settled conviction,<br />
					be reposes faith in him;<br />
					this faith leads him to frequent the Almsman's company<br />
					where he listens<br />
					and hears the Doctrine preached<br />
					and stores it in his memory,<br />
					studying the meaning of all he hears<br />
					till he grows interested<br />
					<a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> and so grows zealous;<br />
					Zeal makes him energetic<br />
					and weigh things and strive amain;<br />
					discarding self,<br />
					he realizes the truth physically<br />
					and penetrates it with his understanding<br />
					till he sees it clearly. -</p>

					<p class="f4">So far, he becomes enlightened in truth<br />
					and recognizes truth,<br />
					as I affirm;<br />
					but this does not give him<br />
					the attainment of truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">I quite follow. -</p>

					<p class="f4">And now as to the attainment of truth?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt174" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg174"><span class="f2">[174]</span></a> That comes by the practice,<br />
					development<br />
					and growth<br />
					of just the aforesaid states of mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">So far, there is attainment of truth<br />
					and he attains it,<br />
					as I affirm.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">I quite follow. -</p>

					<p class="f4">And now what attitude<br />
					fosters this attainment?</p>

					<p class="f4">Striving hard.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the man does not strive hard,<br />
					he will not attain;<br />
					it is because he strives that he attains;<br />
					and therefore striving fosters attainment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What attitude fosters striving?</p>

					<p class="f4">Cogitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he does not cogitate,<br />
					he will not strive;<br />
					it is because he cogitates that he strives;<br />
					and therefore cogitation fosters striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters cogitation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Energy.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he nave not energy... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters energy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Zeal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he have not zeal... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters zeal?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt175" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg175"><span class="f2">[175]</span></a> Interest in the Doctrine... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters interest?</p>

					<p class="f4">Studying the meaning of all he hears... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters this stuay?</p>

					<p class="f4">Stored knowledge of the Doctrine... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters this stored knowledge of the Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing it preached... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters such hearing?</p>

					<p class="f4">Listening... .</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt176" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg176"><span class="f2">[176]</span></a> What fosters listening?</p>

					<p class="f4">Attendance... .</p>

					<p class="f4">What fosters attendance?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></a> Faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">If faith do not abound,<br />
					he will not attend the Almsman;<br />
					it is because he has faith in him that he attends;<br />
					and therefore faith fosters attendance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gotama, I have now asked you<br />
					about maintenance of truth,<br />
					about enlightenment in truth,<br />
					about attainment of truth,<br />
					and about the factors which promote attainment;<br />
					<a id="pt177" href="../../pali/mn/mn.095.pali.bd.htm#pg177"><span class="f2">[177]</span></a> and you have explained it all to me<br />
					to my satisfaction,<br />
					pleasure and delight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up till now, Gotama,<br />
					my attitude used to be -</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who are these shavelings of recluses,<br />
					these menial black fellows,<br />
					sprung from the feet of our kinsman,<br />
					Brahmā?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who are these Doctrine-mongers?'</p>

					<p class="f4">But you, Gotama,<br />
					have aroused in me a liking for recluses,<br />
					a belief in recluses,<br />
					and arespect for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask you to accept me as a disciple who has found an abiding refuge,<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					while life lasts.</p>
