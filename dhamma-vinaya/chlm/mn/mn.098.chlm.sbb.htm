					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Icchānankala<br />
					in the forests there;<br />
					a large number of very well-known and wealthy brahmins were dwelling there,<br />
					such as Cankī,<br />
					Tārukkha,<br />
					Pokkharasāti,<br />
					Jānussoṇi,<br />
					Todeyya<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> and other well-known and wealthy brahmins.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now as the young brahmins Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking,<br />
					and strolling up and down,<br />
					they fell to discussing what makes a brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> Bhāradvāja maintained<br />
					that what made a brahmin<br />
					was pure descent on both sides<br />
					right back for seven successive generations of ancestors,<br />
					with no break or blemish in his lineage;<br />
					whereas Vāseṭṭha contended<br />
					that it was virtue and moral behaviour<br />
					which made a brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As neither could convince the other,<br />
					<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg116"><span class="f2 r">[KD.SNP 116]</span></a> Vāseṭṭha proposed,<br />
					and Bhāradvāja agreed,<br />
					to refer the matter to 'the recluse Gotama'<br />
					who was now staying in the forest of Icchānankala<br />
					and of whom the high repute noised abroad<br />
					was that he was said to be the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So together they went to the Lord<br />
					and, when they were seated after greetings,<br />
					Vāseṭṭha addressed the Lord<br />
					in the following verses: -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Pokkharasāti's pupil I; my friend<br />
							for master had Tārukkha; both alike<br />
							in Threefold Lore have passed and so profess.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">In all the Threefold Lore we perfect are,<br />
							in text and import each his master's peer.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg117"><span class="f2 r">[KD.SNP 117]</span></a> On birth we differ. Bhāradvāja says<br />
							tis birth that makes the brahmin; I say life.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Agree we cannot; so an answer crave<br />
							from you, for high Enlightenment renown'd.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">For, as with hands in adoration raised<br />
							men hail the crescent moon, so men hail you.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Of Gotama, whose vision views the world,<br />
							we ask if birth or life the brahmin makes.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Tell us; we know not, but would fain feel sure.</p>
							
					<p class="f4">To Vāseṭṭha the Lord this answer gave: -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Types manifold of divers living things<br />
							in order'd sequence must I first unfold,<br />
							to show how nature stamps them diverse breeds<br />
							Regard the grass and trees, which ne'er proclaim,<br />
							but prove, how nature stamps them diverse breeds.</p>

 							<a id="pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></a> 							then pass to birds that wing their way through air;<br />
							- all show how nature stamps them diverse breeds.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">While these thus widely differ,<br />
							men alone show not that nature stamps them diverse breeds.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">They differ not in hair, head, ears, or eyes,<br />
							in mouth or nostrils, eyebrows, lips,<br />
							throat, shoulders, belly, buttocks, back, or chest,<br />
							nor in the parts of shame, female or male,<br />
							nor yet in hands or feet, in fingers, nails,<br />
							in calves or thighs; in hue, or sound of voice;<br />
