					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Udena was staying at Benares<br />
					in the mango-grove called Tranquillity,<br />
					the brahmin Ghoṭamukha,<br />
					who had come to Benares on some business or other,<br />
					<a id="pt358" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg358"><span class="f2">[358]</span></a> came, in the course of his walks abroad, to this grove,<br />
					in which Udena was pacing up and down in the open.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having approached Udena and exchanged greetings,<br />
					the brahmin walked by his side,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Recluse, that there is no Pilgrimage for Doctrine' sake,<br />
					is my idea;<br />
					<a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> but it is an idea informed by no acquaintance<br />
					either with men like yourself<br />
					or with Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point,<br />
					Udena cut short his walk<br />
					and went into his cell,<br />
					where he sat down on the seat awaiting him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Likewise, the brahmin cut short his walk<br />
					and also went into the cell,<br />
					where he remained standing,<br />
					till Udena said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here are seats,<br />
					sit down if you will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the brahmin:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I did not sit down till I was bidden.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, how could a man of my position<br />
					sit down unbidden?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the brahmin took a low seat to one side<br />
					and repeated his remark<br />
					that there was no Pilgrimage for Doctrine's sake,<br />
					but that this idea of his<br />
					was informed by no acquaintance either with men like Udena<br />
					or with Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Could we arrange our talk, brahmin,<br />
					on the basis that you will assent to what you admit,<br />
					will reject what you object to,<br />
					and will question me further,<br />
					for reasons or explanations,<br />
					when you do not take my meaning?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Certainly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt159" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg159"><span class="f2">[159]</span></a> Brahmin, there are four types of individuals<br />
					to be found in the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">First, there is he who tortures himself<br />
					and is set on self-torture.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then there is he who tortures others<br />
					and is set on torturing them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, there is he who tortures both himself and others<br />
					and is set on torturing both.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lastly, there is he who tortures neither himself nor others<br />
					and is set on torturing neither.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And this last individual,<br />
					who tortures neither himself nor others,<br />
					dwells - here and now - beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					blissful<br />
					and inwardly at his best.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which of the four, brahmin,<br />
					commends himself most to you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am not drawn, sir,<br />
					to either the self-torturer<br />
					or the torturer of others;<br />
					nor do I approve him who tortures both himself and others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The one who commends himself most to me<br />
					is the last individual,<br />
					- who tortures neither himself nor others<br />
					and dwells - here and now -<br />
					in the felicity you describe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why do not the first three commend themselves to you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> He, sir, who is set on torturing himself,<br />
					tortures his own natural desires for happiness<br />
					and his own natural repugnance to pain;<br />
					and so he does not commend himself to me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt160" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg160"><span class="f2">[160]</span></a> He, again, who is set on torturing others<br />
					tortures others' natural desires for happiness<br />
					and their natural repugnance to pain;<br />
					and so he does not commend himself to me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he who is set on torturing both himself and others,<br />
					tortures both his own and other people's natural desires for happiness<br />
					and natural repugnance to pain;<br />
					and so he does not commend himself to me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But he who is set on torturing neither himself nor other people,<br />
					and dwells - here and now -<br />
					in the felicity you describe,<br />
					he it is who commends himself to me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are two categories of men.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The first, inflamed with a passion for gems and jewelry,<br />
					wants sons and wives,<br />
					wants men and women slaves,<br />
					wants fields and lands,<br />
					wants coins of silver and gold bullion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The second category wants none of these things<br />
					but discards them all<br />
					to go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now in which category<br />
					do you expect to find the man<br />
					who tortures neither himself nor others<br />
					but dwells - here and now - beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					blissful<br />
					and inwardly at his best?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt161" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg161"><span class="f2">[161]</span></a> Why, in the category which wants none of these things<br />
					but discards them all<br />
					to go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But, brahmin, just now you expressed your belief<br />
					that there was no such thing as Pilgrimage for Doctrine's sake, -<br />
					without acquaintance either with men like me<br />
					or with Doctrine!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Clearly, Udena, what I said<br />
					has served a useful purpose.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I now see,<br />
					and you may take me as holding,<br />
					that there is such a thing as Pilgrimage for Doctrine's sake;<br />
					and I should be glad if you would be so good<br />
					as to set out in detail<br />
					what you have indicated in outline<br />
					concerning the four types of individuals.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hearken then, brahmin,<br />
					and give me your attention;<br />
					I will tell you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then to the listening brahmin<br />
 					<a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> 					the reverend Udena spoke as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What manner of man is he<br />
					who tortures himself<br />
					and is set on self-torture?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an individual<br />
					who, naked,<br />
					flouting the decencies of life,<br />
					licking his hands after meals,<br />
					never heeding when folk called to him to come or to stop,<br />
					never accepting food brought to him before his rounds<br />
					or cooked expressly for him,<br />
					never accepting an invitation,<br />
					never receiving food direct from pot or pan<br />
					or within the threshould<br />
					or among the faggots or pestles,<br />
					never from (one only of) two people messing together,<br />
					never from a pregnant woman<br />
					or a nursing mother<br />
					or a woman <i>in coitu,</i><br />
					never from gleanings (in time of famine)<br />
					nor from where a dog is ready at hand<br />
					or where (hungry) flies congregate,<br />
					never touching flesh<br />
					or fish<br />
					or spirits<br />
					or strong drink<br />
					or brews of grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He visits only one house a day<br />
					and there takes only one morsel;<br />
					or he visits but two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven houses a day<br />
					and takes at each only two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven morsels;<br />
					he lives on a single saucer of food a day,<br />
					or on two,<br />
					or (up to) seven saucers;<br />
					he has but one meal a day,<br />
					or one every two days,<br />
					or (so on, up to) every seven days,<br />
					or only once a fortnight,<br />
					on a rigid scale of rationing.</p>

					<p class="f4">His sole diet is herbs gathered green,<br />
					or the grain of wild millets and paddy,<br />
					or snippets of hide,<br />
					or water-plants,<br />
					or the red powder round rice-grains within the husk,<br />
					or the discarded scum of rice on the boil,<br />
					or the flour of oilseeds,<br />
					or grass,<br />
					or cow-dung.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives on wild roots and fruit,<br />
					or on windfalls only.</p>

					<p class="f4">His raiment is of hemp<br />
					or of hempen mixture,<br />
					of cerements,<br />
					of rags from the dust-heap,<br />
					of bark,<br />
					of the black antelope's pelt<br />
					either whole or split down the middle,<br />
					of grass,<br />
					of strips of bark or wood,<br />
					of hair of men or animals woven into a blanket,<br />
					or of owls' wings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In fulfilment of his vows,<br />
					he plucks out the hair of his head<br />
					and the hair of his beard,<br />
					he never quits the upright for the sitting posture,<br />
					squats and never rises up,<br />
					moves only a-squat,<br />
					couches on thorns,<br />
					goes down to the water punctually<br />
					thrice before nightfall<br />
					to wash (away the evil within).</p>					

					<p class="f4">Such are the divers ways<br />
					in which he is given to tormenting his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment himself<br />
					and to be given to self-torment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual<br />
					is he who torments others<br />
					and is given to tormenting others?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of the individual<br />
					who butchers sheep<br />
					or sticks pigs,<br />
					or is a fowler,<br />
					deer-stalker,<br />
					hunter,<br />
					fisherman,<br />
					robber,<br />
					cut-throat,<br />
					or gaoler,<br />
					or who follows any other cruel trade.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment others<br />
					and to be given to tormenting others.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual<br />
					is he who torments himself and others too?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an individual<br />
					who becomes an anointed king of Noble race,<br />
					or a brahmin magnate.</p>

					<p class="f4">East of the town,<br />
					he orders the building of a new sacrificial hall,<br />
					into which - after first cutting off his hair and beard<br />
					and donning the rough pelt of a black antelope -<br />
					he goes with his queen-consort<br />
					and his brahmin chaplain,<br />
					with his body anointed with ghee and oil,<br />
					and scratching his itching back with an antler.</p>

					<p class="f4">His bed is grass and leaves<br />
					strewn on the bare ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the whole party,<br />
					there is only one solitary cow,<br />
					with a calf by her side,<br />
					which must be coloured precisely like its mother;<br />
					and on this solitary cow's milk<br />
					the king has the first call,<br />
					the queen-consort takes the second turn,<br />
					the brahmin the third,<br />
					the fourth makes the fire-oblation,<br />
					while the calf has to get along on what is left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Says the king:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let there be slain for the sacrifice<br />
					so many bulls,<br />
					so many steers,<br />
					heifers,<br />
					goats,<br />
					and rams.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let there be felled<br />
					so many trees for sacrificial posts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let so much kusa grass be cut<br />
					to strew round the sacrificial spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">And all persons known as slaves,<br />
					messengers,<br />
					and servants,<br />
					harried by stripes and fear,<br />
					then set about the preparations<br />
					with tearful faces<br />
					and voices of lamentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment himself and others,<br />
					and to be given to tormenting both.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, what kind of individual<br />
					is he who, tormenting neither himself nor others,<br />
					dwells, here and now, beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss,<br />
					and in holiness?</p>							
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case<br />
					that there appears here in the world<br />
					a truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself,<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches his Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of other birth,<br />
					who hearing it<br />
					puts his trust in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and in this trust<br />
					bethinks him that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from the circle of his kinsfolk,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					schooled in the Almsmens precepts<br />
					and way of life,<br />
					he puts from him all killing<br />
					and abstains from killing anything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					he lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft he puts from him and eschews;<br />
					taking only what is given to him by others,<br />
					and waiting till it is given,<br />
					he lives an honest and clean life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					all that does not belong to the higher life,<br />
					he leads the higher life in virtue,<br />
					abstaining from low sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					and abstaining from all lying,<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					cleaves to the truth,<br />
					and is staunch and leal,<br />
					never deceiving the world with his lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calumny he puts from him and eschews,<br />
					not repeating elsewhere<br />
					to the harm of people here<br />
					what he hears there,<br />
					nor repeating here<br />
					to the harm of people elsewhere<br />
					what he hears elsewhere;<br />
					thus he heals divisions<br />
					and cements friendship,<br />
					seeking peace<br />
					and ensuing it;<br />
					for in peace is his delight<br />
					and his words are ever the words of a peacemaker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling he puts from him,<br />
					and abstains from reviling people;<br />
					his words are without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					going home to the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tattle he puts from him<br />
					and abstains therefrom,<br />
					he speaks, in season<br />
					and according to the facts,<br />
					words of help<br />
					concerning the Doctrine<br />
					and the Rule,<br />
					words to be stored in the heart,<br />
					words duly illustrated,<br />
					fraught with purpose,<br />
					and pithy.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sedulously avoids hurting the seeds<br />
					or plants of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					never eating at night<br />
					or after hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from looking on at shows of dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews all use and employment<br />
					of smart garlands,<br />
					scents<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sleeps on no tall or broad beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses to accept gold<br />
					or coins of silver, -<br />
					uncooked grain or meat, -<br />
					women or girls, -<br />
					bondwomen or bondmen, -<br />
					sheep or goats, -<br />
					fowls or swine, -<br />
					elephants or cattle or horses or mares, -<br />
					fields or land.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from the practice<br />
					of sending or going on messages.</p>

					<p class="f4">He neither buys nor sells.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never cheats with weights,<br />
					coins,<br />
					or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes no part in bribery,<br />
					cozening,<br />
					cheating,<br />
					or other crooked ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never joins in wounding,<br />
					murdering,<br />
					and manacling,<br />
					or in highway robbery,<br />
					brigandage,<br />
					and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contented is he<br />
					with whatever robes are given him<br />
					as clothing,<br />
					and with whatever alms are given<br />
					for his belly's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a winged bird,<br />
					wheresoever it goes,<br />
					carries with it its feathers and all, -<br />
					so, wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					he enjoys unsullied well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with his eye<br />
					he sees a visible shape,<br />
					he is not absorbed by either its general appearance<br />
					or its details;<br />
					but, since the eye uncontrolled<br />
					might lead to covetousness and discontent,<br />
					to evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					he schools himself to control it,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to establish control.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he does the like<br />
					with his five other faculties of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble control over his faculties,<br />
					he enjoys unalloyed well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purposeful is he in all his doings, -<br />
					whether in coming in or going out,<br />
					in looking ahead or around,<br />
					in stretching out his arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing his clothes<br />
					or carrying his bowl,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring food,<br />
					in attending to the calls of nature,<br />
					in walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speech or in silence; -<br />
					he is always purposeful in all he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					a master of this noble code of control of his faculties of sense,<br />
					and a master of noble mindfulness and purpose in all he does,<br />
					he resorts to a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					when he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					with his heart set on mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His life is purged<br />
					(i.) of appetite for things of the world,<br />
					for he has put from him<br />
					all appetite therefor; -<br />
					(ii.) of all spiteful thoughts,<br />
					for he is filled only with loving-kindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives; -<br />
					(iii.) of all torpor,<br />
					for all torpor has left him,<br />
					driven out by clarity of vision,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by purpose in all he does; -<br />
					(iv.) of ail flurry and worry,<br />
					for he is serene,<br />
					and his heart within is at peace<br />
					and quit of all worries; - and<br />
					(v.) of all doubts,<br />
					for his life is unclouded by doubt,<br />
					he is troubled by no questionings,<br />
					right states of mind<br />
					have purged his heart of all doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has put from him these Five Hindrances,<br />
					those defilements of the heart<br />
					which weaken a man's insight,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>					

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>					

					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>					

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it is thus that he applies his heart<br />
					to the knowledge which recalls his own earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					and then two ...<br />
					(and so on to) a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its reintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that existence, he remembers,<br />
					such and such was his name,<br />
					his clan,<br />
					his class,<br />
					his diet,<br />
					his joys and sorrows,<br />
					and his term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he passed thence,<br />
					he came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was his name and so forth;<br />
					and thence he passed to his life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he call to mind<br />
					his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>	

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					he sees them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					I11,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					what the Cankers were,<br />
					with their origin,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows this<br />
					and when he sees this,<br />
					then his heart is delivered<br />
					from the Canker of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction -<br />
					Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me<br />
					there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment neither himself nor others,<br />
					and not to be given to tormenting either himself or others,<br />
					but to dwell, here and now,<br />
					beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					<a id="pt162" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg162"><span class="f2">[162]</span></a> unfevered,<br />
					blissful and inwardly at his best.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the close of these words,<br />
					the brahmin Ghoṭamukha exclaimed to the reverend Udena:Wonderful,<br />
					Udena:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Udena, wonderful!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Udena expounded his doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To him I come as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					and I ask him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come not to me, brahmin,<br />
					as your refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Find your refuge,<br />
					as I have found mine,<br />
					in none but the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where is the present dwelling-place of that Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has now passed away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If I could but listen to him<br />
					within ten leagues from here,<br />
					ten leagues would I travel to visit him;<br />
					nay,<br />
					I would travd twenty,<br />
					thirty,<br />
					forty,<br />
					fifty or a hundred leagues <a id="pt163" href="../../pali/mn/mn.094.pali.bd.htm#pg163"><span class="f2">[163]</span></a> to visit Gotama,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But though he has passed away,<br />
					still it is to Gotama<br />
					that I come as my refuge,<br />
					to him<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					and I ask you to receive me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.

					Moreover, Udena, the king of the Anga country<br />
					gives me a regular daily allowance, -<br />
					out of which I will give you a regular allowance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How much is your daily allowance from the king?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Five hundred pence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We may not take money.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you may not,<br />
					then I will have a cell built for you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you want to do that,<br />
					you might build an assembly-hall<br />
					for the Confratemity at Pāṭaliputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It makes me still more pleased and delighted with <a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> you,<br />
					Udena,<br />
					that you urge me to bestow my benefaction<br />
					on the Confraternity as a whole;<br />
					and I will do so<br />
					out of this and further allowances.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, the brahmin Ghoṭamukha<br />
					built the assembly-hall at Pāṭaliputta<br />
					which bears his name to-day.</p>
