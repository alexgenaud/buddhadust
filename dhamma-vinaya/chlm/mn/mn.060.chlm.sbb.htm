					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosala</a> with a great company of Almsmen,<br />
					he came to a brahmin village of the Kosalans named Sālā.</p>

					<p class="f4">It came to the ears of the heads of houses there<br />
					that the recluse Gotama <a id="pt401" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg401"><span class="f2">[401]</span></a> ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.041.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 41</a>) ...<br />
					and others again in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they were seated,<br />
					the Lord asked these brahmins<br />
					whether they had got a favourite teacher<br />
					in whom they had confidence.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir, was their answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, as you have not got a favourite teacher of your own,<br />
					you should embrace and fulfil the Sound Doctrine,<br />
					to your lasting happiness and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what does it consist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Among recluses and brahmins<br />
					some there are who hold and affirm<br />
					that there is no such thing as alms<br />
					or sacrifice<br />
					or oblations;<br />
					no such thing as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of actions good or bad;<br />
					no such thing as this world<br />
					or the next;<br />
					no such thing as either parents<br />
					or spontaneous generation;<br />
					no such thing in this world<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who have achieved success<br />
					and walk aright,<br />
					who have, of and by themselves,<br />
					apprehended and realized this world and the next<br />
					and make it all known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Others again <a id="pt402" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg402"><span class="f2">[402]</span></a> maintain<br />
					that there are indeed such things as these.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, sirs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are not these two schools of recluses and brahmins<br />
					diametrically opposed,<br />
					one to the other?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those who hold and affirm<br />
					that there are no such things as the foregoing,<br />
					it may be predicated that,<br />
					scouting the three right principles<br />
					of good behaviour in body, word and thought<br />
					they will embrace and follow<br />
					the three wrong principles<br />
					of bad behaviour in body, <a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> word and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because such recluses and brahmins<br />
					see neither the peril, vanity and foulness<br />
					of the wrong qualities<br />
					nor the blessing which comes<br />
					of Renunciation allied to sanctity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although there is indeed a next world,<br />
					he holds the view there is not,<br />
					and this is his wrong view;<br />
					he resolves there is not,<br />
					and this is his wrong resolve;<br />
					he says there is not,<br />
					and this is his wrong speech;<br />
					he insists there is not,<br />
					and therein goes counter to Arahats<br />
					who are versed in worlds beyond this;<br />
					he persuades others there is no next world,<br />
					and so diffuses false doctrine;<br />
					and in diffusing it<br />
					he exalts himself and disparages others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, his earlier virtues are shed<br />
					and vices are now installed;<br />
					and this wrong view,<br />
					this wrong resolve,<br />
					this wrong speech,<br />
					this antagonism to the Noble,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					this diffusion of false doctrine,<br />
					this self-exaltation<br />
					and this disparagement of others, -<br />
					all these several bad and wrong principles<br />
					thrive apace because of his wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt403" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg403"><span class="f2">[403]</span></a>	In this case<br />
					a man of intelligence says to himself<br />
					that, if there be no world to come,<br />
					then this individual,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					will fare well;<br />
					but, if there be a world to come,<br />
					will pass to a doom<br />
					of tribulation and woe<br />
					or to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, it be granted that there is no other world<br />
					and if it be assumed<br />
					that the negative view is true,<br />
					then the individual stands condemned here and now<br />
					by men of intelligence<br />
					as a bad liver,<br />
					a holder of wrong views<br />
					and an apostle of vanity.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if there is another world,<br />
					then this individual loses both ways,<br />
					first by being here and now-condemned<br />
					by men of intelligence<br />
					and secondly by passing at death<br />
					to a doom of tribulation and woe<br />
					or to purgatory;<br />
					so the sound doctrine<br />
					is not embraced and followed by him;<br />
					he is one-sided;<br />
					he misses the right conclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those, on the other hand,<br />
					who hold and affirm<br />
					that there are indeed such things as the foregoing,<br />
					it may be predicated that,<br />
					scouting the three wrong <a id="pg291"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></a> principles<br />

					the three right principles<br />
					of good behaviour in body, word and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because such recluses and brahmins<br />
					see both the peril, vanity and foulness<br />
					of the wrong principles<br />
					and the blessing which comes<br />
					of Renunciation allied to sanctity.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being a next world,<br />
					he holds the view that there is,<br />
					and this is his right view;<br />
					he resolves that there is,<br />
					and this is his right resolve;<br />
					he insists that there is,<br />
					and therein goes not counter to Arahats<br />
					who are versed in worlds beyond this;<br />
					he <a id="pt404" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg404"><span class="f2">[404]</span></a> persuades others<br />
					that there is a next world,<br />
					and so diffuses right doctrine,<br />
					and in diffusing it<br />
					neither exalts himself nor disparages others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, his earlier vices are shed<br />
					and virtue is now installed;<br />
					and this right view,<br />
					this right resolve,<br />
					this right speech,<br />
					this unison with the Noble,<br />
					this diffusion of right doctrine,<br />
					this absence alike of self-exaltation<br />
					and of disparagement of others, -<br />
					all these several right principles<br />
					thrive apace because of his right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a man of intelligence says to himself<br />
					that, if there is a world to come,<br />
					then this individual,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					will pass to a happy state or to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, however, it be granted<br />
					that there is no other world<br />
					and if it be assumed<br />
					that the negative view is true,<br />
					then the individual is here and now<br />
					extolled by men of intelligence<br />
					as living a good life,<br />
					holding right views,<br />
					and preaching what is salutary.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, should there be a world to come,<br />
					then this individual gains both ways,<br />
					first by being here and now extolled by the intelligent,<br />
					and secondly by passing at death<br />
					to a happy state or to heaven;<br />
					so the sound doctrine<br />
					is embraced and followed by him;<br />
					he is two-sided;<br />
					he seizes on the right conclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Other recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who hold and affirm that<br />
					no evil is wrought by him<br />
					who either himself acts<br />
					or causes another to act,<br />
					who maims or causes another to maim,<br />
					who causes grief or misery,<br />
					who tortures or causes another to torture,<br />
					who sets folk quaking<br />
					or causes another to do so,<br />
					who slays,<br />
					<a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> who steals,<br />
					who is a burglar<br />
					or a dacoit<br />
					or a housebreaker<br />
					or a foot-pad<br />
					or an adulterer<br />
					or a liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, say they,<br />
					with a cleaver as sharp as a razor<br />
					he were to make a single heap and mound of flesh<br />
					out of all that lives on earth,<br />
					no guilt proceeds therefrom<br />
					and no consequence of guilt ensues;<br />
					nor does guilt proceed or ensue<br />
					if he were to march to the southern bank of the Ganges<br />
					killing and slaughtering,<br />
					maiming and causing to be maimed,<br />
					torturing and causing to be tortured.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor again, say they,<br />
					if he were to march to the northern bank of the Ganges<br />
					distributing alms<br />
					and causing alms to be distributed,<br />
					offering sacrifices<br />
					and causing sacrifices to be offered, -<br />
					no virtue proceeds therefrom<br />
					and no consequence of virtue ensues;<br />
					no virtue proceeds or ensues from alms-giving<br />
					or self-control<br />
					or temperance<br />
					or from speaking truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Other recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who hold and affirm <a id="pt405" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg405"><span class="f2">[405]</span></a> on the contrary<br />
					that guilt does proceed in the former case<br />
					and virtue in the latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, sirs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are not these two schools of recluses and brahmins<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt408" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg408"><span class="f2">[408]</span></a> Are not these two schools<br />

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those who hold and affirm<br />

					<p class="f4">Some recluses and brahmins, moreover,<br />

					<p class="f4">What think you, sirs?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are not these two schools<br />

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case a man of intelligence says to himself<br />

					<p class="f4">If, he says, those speak truly<br />

					whereas if the exponents of Incorporeal Realms speak truly,<br />
					it may be that I shall surely get to<br />

					at any rate we see<br />
					that the Corporeal results in assaults with clubs and swords,<br />

					<p class="f4">Led by these reflections,<br />

					<p class="f4">Some recluses and brahmins there are<br />

					while the positive view<br />
					has the precise opposites of all these things<br />
					for its neighbours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Led by these reflections,<br />
					he sets his course towards viewing all continuing existence<br />
					without interest<br />
					and without zest,<br />

					<p class="f4">There are four types of individuals<br />
					to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, there is he who tortures himself<br />

					<p class="f4">Then there is he who tortures others<br />
					and is set on torturing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, there is he who tortures both himself and others;<br />
					while, lastly, there is the man<br />
					who tortures neither himself nor others.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this <a id="pt412" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg412"><span class="f2">[412]</span></a> last individual,<br />

					dwells - here and now -<br />
					beyond all appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					blissful<br />
					and perfected.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what kind of individual is he<br />
					who tortures himself<br />
					and is given up to self-torture?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of the individual<br />
					who goes naked<br />
					and flouts the decencies of life ... etc.,<br />
					as in the <a href="mn.051.chlm.sbb.htm">Kandaraka-Sutta (No. 51)</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the various ways<br />
					in which he tortures his own body;<br />
					and such a man is called a self-torturer,<br />
					given up to self-torture.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual is he<br />
					who tortures others<br />
					and is given up to torturing them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of the individual who<br />
					butchers sheep or swine ... (etc., as in <a href="mn.051.chlm.sbb.htm">No. 51</a>)<br />
					... other cruel trade.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is called a torturer of others,<br />
					given up to torturing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual is he who<br />
					tortures both himself and others too?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of the individual who<br />
					is an anointed king of the race of Nobles ... (etc. as in <a href="mn.051.chlm.sbb.htm">No. 51</a>) ...<br />
					and voices of lamentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is called a torturer both of himself and of others. <a id="pg297"><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></a> Lastly, what kind of individual is he who,<br />

					and given to torturing neither himself nor them,<br />
					dwells - here and now -<br />
					beyond all appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					blissful<br />
					and perfected?</p>

					<p class="f4">There appears in the world here a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened ... (etc., as in <a href="mn.051.chlm.sbb.htm">No. 51</a>) ...<br />
					<a id="pt413" href="../../pali/mn/mn.060.pali.bd.htm#pg413"><span class="f2">[413]</span></a> and now for me<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here clearly the plural Ariya is a synonym for the Arahats supra.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See Charpentier on 'The Le&#347;yā-theory of the Jainas and Ājīvikas' in the Särtryk in honour of K. J. Johannson (Goteborg, 1910). But the Jain 'colours' arose as the direct product of <i>Karma,</i> which Makkhali is here represented as flouting. At <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.33.06.pali.bd.htm#pg250"><i>D.</i> III, 250</a> only two <i>abhijātis</i> are particularized as colours (the 'black' and the 'white'), but at <i>D.A.</i> I, 162 <i>Bu.</i> completes the six (as colours) by adding blue, red, yellow and very white. The Cy. (here) goes on to explain that - in an ascending scale - the black or lowest are bird-fowlers, pig-stickers, fishermen, robbers, robbers' executioners, and all others who follow cruel callings. Buddhist almsmen are 'blue.' - It is said that these, putting 'thorns' in the Four Requisites (of an Almsman), eat them, and so an Almsman is a 'thorn-liver,' this being their creed; or 'thorn-livers' are certain Pilgrims <i>(pabbajitā)</i>, for, in their belief, recluses <i>(samaṇas)</i> are 'thorn-livers.' - The 'red' are Nigaṇṭhas who wear one garment, and are reputed to be whiter than the foregoing two classes. The 'yellow' are lay folk who are followers of the unclad <i>(gihi-acela-sāvakā);</i> thus they make their own donors of requisites higher than the Nigaṇṭhas. Nanda Vaccha and Sankicca are classed as 'white,' being spoken of as whiter than the foregoing four classes. The Ājīvakas are spoken of as 'whitest of all,' being reputed whiter than all the others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On our Majjhima passage, <i>Bu.</i>  concludes his exegesis by saying that: - first of all <i>(paṭhamaɱ)</i> all people are bird-fowlers etc. In the successive stages of being purified <i>(tato visujjhamanā)</i> they become Sakya Recluses; then Nigaṇṭhas, then disciples of the Ājīvakas; then Nanda etc.; and then Ājīvakas;. Such is the doctrine held. The 'white' class is to be explained as the converse to what has been said (of the othei classes).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the Sumangala-Vilāsinī version (I, 162), apart from minor differences, Makkhali Gosāla is added to Nanda Vaccha and [Kisa] Sankicca, - the trio being raised from the white category to the whitest of all, while ājīvakas [and female ājīvakas] descend to the merely 'white' and there is no specific mention of Samaṇas (as above) in connection with bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In adopting the two colours, black and white, Buddhism characteristically adopts also the familiar number of six <i>abhi-jātis</i> (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.33.06.pali.bd.htm#pg250"><i>D.</i> III, 250-1</a>), but transmutes their meaning ethically. Thus, a man born into a black (or dark) environment may evolve therein (i) a black character and life or (ii) a white character and life or (iii) Nirvana. And so also threefold possibilities lie before the man born into a white (or bright) environment.</p>
