					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#campa">Campa</a><br />
					by the banks of the lake (of Queen) Gaggarā<br />
					with a great following of Almsmen,<br />
					there came to him Pessa, the elephant trainer's son,<br />
					and Kandaraka the Wanderer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Saluting the Lord,<br />
					Pessa took a seat to one side,<br />
					while Kandaraka, after exchanging courteous greetings,<br />
					remained standing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Marking the universal silence of the Confraternity as he stood there,<br />
					Kandaraka said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, Gotama,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					how you have schooled your Confraternity, -<br />
					even to that perfection<br />
					which Arahats all-enlightened reached of yore<br />
					and Arahats all enlightened will reach in ages to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Kandaraka; as it is now,<br />
					so it has been of yore<br />
					and so it will be in ages to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, in this Confraternity<br />
					there are Almsmen who are Arahats, -<br />
					in whom the Cankers are eradicated,<br />
					who have greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have cast off their burthens,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					whose bonds are no more,<br />
					who by utter knowledge<br />
					have found Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here too there are Almsmen<br />
					still under training,<br />
					uniformly virtuous<br />
					and uniformly good in their lives,<br />
					men of understanding,<br />
					with understanding shown forth in their lives,<br />
					whose hearts are stablished<br />
					in the four applications of mindfulness,<br />
					as in the case of an Almsman who -<br />
					realizing<br />
					(i) body,<br />
					(ii) feelings,<br />
					(iii)	heart, and<br />
					(iv) states of consciousness<br />
					to be just what they respectively are -<br />
					lives the strenuous life,<br />
					purposeful and mindful,<br />
					quelling all worldly hankerings and frets.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon Pessa said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful,<br />
					it is <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> marvellous<br />
					how well the Lord has indicated the four applications of mindfulness<br />
					so as to cleanse men's hearts,<br />
					to raise them above sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					to annihilate pain of body and of mind,<br />
					to achieve the system,<br />
					and to realize Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even we who live in houses<br />
					and wear the white clothes of the layman,<br />
					even we from time to time<br />
					have our hearts stablished in the four applications of mindfulness<br />
					and - realizing body,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					heart,<br />
					and states of consciousness<br />
					to be just what they respectively are -<br />
					live the strenuous life,<br />
					purposeful and mindful,<br />
					quelling all worldly hankerings and frets.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it is wonderful and marvellous<br />
					how - in this human tangle<br />
					with all its bitterness and guile -<br />
					the Lord knows man's weal and woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">For men are indeed a tangle,<br />
					whereas animals are a simple matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself can train a young elephant<br />
					to remember, whensoever he is going in or out of Campa,<br />
					to display every naughty and roguish trick he possibly can.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those that are styled our slaves<br />
					and messengers<br />
					and servants<br />
					do one thing,<br />
					say another,<br />
					and think a third.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it is wonderful and marvellous ...<br />
					animals are a simple matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Pessa.<a id="pt341" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg341"><span class="f2">[341]</span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Men are indeed a tangle,<br />
					whereas animals are a simple matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four types of individuals to be found in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">One torments himself<br />
					and is given to self-torment;<br />
					a second torments others<br />
					and is given to tormenting others;<br />
					a third torments himself and others,<br />
					and is given to tormenting both;<br />
					while the fourth torments neither,<br />
					and is given to tormenting neither, -<br />
					dwelling, here and now,<br />
					beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss,<br />
					and in holiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now which of the four, Pessa,<br />
					commends himself most to you?</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not drawn, sir,<br />
					either to the self-tormenter<br />
					or to the tormenter of others;<br />
					nor can I commend him who does both.</p>

					<p class="f4">The individual who commends himself most to me<br />
					out of the four<br />
					is the fourth,<br />
					the man who neither torments himself nor others,<br />
					who dwells, here and now, beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss,<br />
					and in holiness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg248"><span class="f2 g"><b>[248]</b></span></a> And why, Pessa, do you not approve of the first three?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not approve of the first, sir,<br />
					because he torments and tortures himself,<br />
					despite his yearnings for pleasure<br />
					and despite his repugnance to pain;<br />
					nor do I approve of the second,<br />
					because he torments and tortures others,<br />
					despite their yearnings for pleasure<br />
					and repugnance to pain;<br />
					nor of the third,<br />
					because he torments and tortures both himself and others,<br />
					despite his and their yearnings for pleasure<br />
					and repugnance to pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I do approve of the fourth,<br />
					because, tormenting and torturing<br />
					neither himself nor others,<br />
					he dwells, here and now,<br />
					beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss,<br />
					and in holiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, sir, I must be going,<br />
					for I have much to do and attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not let me detain you, Pessa.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, with grateful thanks to the Lord for what he had heard,<br />
					Pessa, the elephant trainer's son,<br />
					rose up, saluted, and withdrew with deep veneration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pessa had not been gone long<br />
					when the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Pessa, Almsmen, is informed<br />
					and has great understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had he but sat on a little longer,<br />
					while I set out in detail<br />
					the distinctions between the four types of individual,<br />
					he would have carried away with him<br />
					what would have profited him greatly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Lord, is the time for that;<br />
					now is the time, Blessed One;<br />
					the Almsmen will treasure up the Lord's utterance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord proceeded to address the listening Almsmen, as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual<br />
					is he who torments himself<br />
					and is given to self-torment?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an individual<br />
					who, naked,<br />
					flouting the decencies of life,<br />
					licking his hands after meals,<br />
					never heeding when folk called to him to come or to stop,<br />
					never accepting food brought to him before his rounds<br />
					or cooked expressly for him,<br />
					never accepting an invitation,<br />
					never receiving food direct from pot or pan<br />
					or within the threshould<br />
					or among the faggots or pestles,<br />
					never from (one only of) two people messing together,<br />
					never from a pregnant woman<br />
					or a nursing mother<br />
					or a woman <i>in coitu,</i><br />
					never from gleanings (in time of famine)<br />
					nor from where a dog is ready at hand<br />
					or where (hungry) flies congregate,<br />
					never touching flesh<br />
					or fish<br />
					or spirits<br />
					or strong drink<br />
					or brews of grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He visits only one house a day<br />
					and there takes only one morsel;<br />
					or he visits but two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven houses a day<br />
					and takes at each only two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven morsels;<br />
					he lives on a single saucer of food a day,<br />
					or on two,<br />
					or (up to) seven saucers;<br />
					he has but one meal a day,<br />
					or one every two days,<br />
					or (so on, up to) every seven days,<br />
					or only once a fortnight,<br />
					on a rigid scale of rationing.</p>

					<p class="f4">His sole diet is herbs gathered green,<br />
					or the grain of wild millets and paddy,<br />
					or snippets of hide,<br />
					or water-plants,<br />
					or the red powder round rice-grains within the husk,<br />
					or the discarded scum of rice on the boil,<br />
					or the flour of oilseeds,<br />
					or grass,<br />
					or cow-dung.</p>

					<p class="f4">He lives on wild roots and fruit,<br />
					or on windfalls only.</p>

					<p class="f4">His raiment is of hemp<br />
					or of hempen mixture,<br />
					of cerements,<br />
					of rags from the dust-heap,<br />
					of bark,<br />
					of the black antelope's pelt<br />
					either whole or split down the middle,<br />
					of grass,<br />
					of strips of bark or wood,<br />
					of hair of men or animals woven into a blanket,<br />
					or of owls' wings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In fulfilment of his vows,<br />
					he plucks out the hair of his head<br />
					and the hair of his beard,<br />
					he never quits the upright for the sitting posture,<br />
					squats and never rises up,<br />
					moves only a-squat,<br />
					couches on thorns,<br />
					goes down to the water punctually<br />
					thrice before nightfall<br />

					to wash (away the evil within).</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the divers ways<br />
					in which he is given to tormenting his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment himself<br />
					and to be given to self-torment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual<br />
					is he who torments others<br />
					and is given to tormenting others?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of the individual<br />
					who butchers sheep<br />
					or sticks pigs,<br />
					or <a id="pg249"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span></a> who is a fowler,<br />
					deer-stalker,<br />
					hunter,<br />
					fisherman,<br />
					robber,<br />
					cut-throat,<br />
					or gaoler,<br />
					or who follows any other cruel trade.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment others<br />
					and to be given to tormenting others.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of individual<br />
					is he who torments himself and others too?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Take the case of an individual<br />
					who becomes an anointed king of Noble race,<br />
					or a brahmin magnate.</p>

					<p class="f4">East of the town,<br />
					he orders the building of a new sacrificial hall,<br />
					into which - after first cutting off his hair and beard<br />
					and donning the rough pelt of a black antelope -<br />
					he goes with his queen-consort<br />
					and his brahmin chaplain,<br />
					with his body anointed with ghee and oil,<br />
					and scratching his itching back with an antler.</p>

					<p class="f4">His bed is grass and leaves<br />
					strewn on the bare ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the whole party,<br />
					there is only one solitary cow,<br />
					with a calf by her side,<br />
					which must be coloured precisely like its mother;<br />
					and on this solitary cow's milk<br />
					<a id="pt344" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg344"><span class="f2">[344]</span></a> the king has the first call,<br />
					the queen-consort takes the second turn,<br />
					the brahmin the third,<br />
					the fourth makes the fire-oblation,<br />
					while the calf has to get along on what is left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Says the king:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let there be slain for the sacrifice<br />
					so many bulls,<br />
					so many steers,<br />
					heifers,<br />
					goats,<br />
					and rams.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let there be felled<br />
					so many trees for sacrificial posts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let so much kusa grass be cut<br />
					to strew round the sacrificial spot.</p>

					<p class="f4">And all persons known as slaves,<br />
					messengers,<br />
					and servants,<br />
					harried by stripes and fear,<br />
					then set about the preparations<br />
					with tearful faces<br />
					and voices of lamentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment himself and others,<br />
					and to be given to tormenting both.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, what kind of individual<br />
					is he who, tormenting neither himself nor others,<br />
					dwells, here and now, beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss,<br />
					and in holiness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case<br />
					that there appears here in the world<br />
					a truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-en- <a id="pg250"><span class="f2 g"><b>[250]</b></span></a> lightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself,<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches his Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of other birth,<br />
					who hearing it<br />
					puts his trust in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and in this trust<br />
					bethinks him that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from the circle of his kinsfolk,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					schooled in the Almsmens precepts<br />
					and way of life,<br />
					he puts from him all killing<br />
					and abstains from killing anything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					he lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft he puts from him and eschews;<br />
					taking only what is given to him by others,<br />
					and waiting till it is given,<br />
					he lives an honest and clean life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					all that does not belong to the higher life,<br />
					he leads the higher life in virtue,<br />
					abstaining from low sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					and abstaining from all lying,<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					cleaves to the truth,<br />
					and is staunch and leal,<br />
					never deceiving the world with his lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calumny he puts from him and eschews,<br />
					not repeating elsewhere<br />
					to the harm of people here<br />
					what he hears there,<br />
					nor repeating here<br />
					to the harm of people elsewhere<br />
					what he hears elsewhere;<br />
					thus he heals divisions<br />
					and cements friendship,<br />
					seeking peace<br />
					and ensuing it;<br />
					for in peace is his delight<br />
					and his words are ever the words of a peacemaker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling he puts from him,<br />
					and abstains from reviling people;<br />
					his words are without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					going home to the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tattle he puts from him<br />
					and abstains therefrom,<br />
					he speaks, in season<br />
					and according to the facts,<br />
					words of help<br />
					concerning the Doctrine<br />
					and the Rule,<br />
					words to be stored in the heart,<br />
					words duly illustrated,<br />
					fraught with purpose,<br />
					and pithy.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sedulously avoids hurting the seeds<br />
					or plants of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					never eating at night<br />
					or after hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from looking on at shows of dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews all use and employment<br />
					of smart garlands,<br />
					scents<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sleeps on no tall or broad beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses to accept gold<br />
					or coins of silver, -<br />
					uncooked grain or meat, -<br />
					women or girls, -<br />
					bondwomen or bondmen, -<br />
					sheep or goats, -<br />
					fowls or swine, -<br />
					elephants or cattle or horses or mares, -<br />
					fields or land.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from the practice<br />
					of sending or going on messages.</p>

					<p class="f4">He neither buys nor sells.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never cheats with weights,<br />
					coins,<br />
					or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes no part in bribery,<br />
					cozening,<br />
					cheating,<br />
					or other crooked ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never joins in wounding,<br />
					murdering,<br />
					and manacling,<br />
					or in highway robbery,<br />
					brigandage,<br />
					and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contented is he<br />
					with whatever robes are given him<br />
					as clothing,<br />
					and with whatever alms are given<br />
					for his belly's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a winged bird,<br />
					wheresoever it goes,<br />
					carries with it its feathers and all, -<br />
					so, wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					he enjoys unsullied well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with his eye<br />
					he sees a visible shape,<br />
					he is not absorbed by either its general appearance<br />
					or its details;<br />
					but, since the eye uncontrolled<br />
					might lead to covetousness and discontent,<br />
					to evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					he schools himself to control it,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to establish control.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he does the like<br />
					with his five other faculties of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble control over his faculties,<br />
					he enjoys unalloyed well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purposeful is he in all his doings, -<br />
					whether in coming in or going out,<br />
					in looking ahead or around,<br />
					in stretching out his arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing his clothes<br />
					or carrying his bowl,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring food,<br />
					in attending to the calls of nature,<br />
					in walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speech or in silence; -<br />
					he is always purposeful in all he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					a master of this noble code of control of his faculties of sense,<br />
					and a master of noble mindfulness and purpose in all he does,<br />
					he resorts to a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					when he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					with his heart set on mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His life is purged<br />
					(i.) of appetite for things of the world,<br />
					for he has put from him<br />
					all appetite therefor; -<br />
					(ii.) of all spiteful thoughts,<br />
					for he is filled only with loving-kindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives; -<br />
					(iii.) of all torpor,<br />
					for all torpor has left him,<br />
					driven out by clarity of vision,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by purpose in all he does; -<br />
					(iv.) of ail flurry and worry,<br />
					for he is serene,<br />
					and his heart within is at peace<br />
					and quit of all worries; - and<br />
					(v.) of all doubts,<br />
					for his life is unclouded by doubt,<br />
					he is troubled by no questionings,<br />
					right states of mind<br />
					have purged his heart of all doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has put from him these Five Hindrances,<br />
					those defilements of the heart<br />
					which weaken a man's insight,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					<a id="pt345" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg345"><span class="f2">[345-7]</span></a> 					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>					

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>					

					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>					

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it is thus that he applies his heart<br />
					to the knowledge which recalls his own earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					and then two ...<br />
					(and so on to) a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that existence, he remembers,<br />
					such and such was his name,<br />
					his clan,<br />
					his class,<br />
					his diet,<br />
					his joys and sorrows,<br />
					and his term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he passed thence,<br />
					he came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was his name and so forth;<br />
					<a id="pt348" href="../../pali/mn/mn.051.pali.bd.htm#pg348"><span class="f2">[348]</span></a> and thence he passed to his life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he call to mind<br />
					his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					he sees them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					I11,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					what the Cankers were,<br />
					with their origin,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows this<br />
					and when he sees this,<br />
					then his heart is Delivered<br />
					from the Canker of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus Delivered comes <a id="pg251"><span class="f2 g"><b>[251]</b></span></a> the knowledge Of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction -<br />
					Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me<br />
					there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to torment neither himself nor others,<br />
					and not to be given to tormenting either himself or others,<br />
					but to dwell, here and now,<br />
					beyond appetites,<br />
					consummate,<br />
					unfevered,<br />
					in bliss and in holiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
