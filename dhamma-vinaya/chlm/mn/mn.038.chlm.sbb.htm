					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					an Almsman named Sati, a fishermans son,<br />
					<a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> came to entertain the pernicious view that,<br />
					as he understood the Lord's teaching of the Doctrine,<br />
					our consciousness runs on<br />
					and continues without break of identity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing of this,<br />
					a number of Almsmen<br />
					went to ask Sati<br />
					whether he was correctly reported<br />
					as entertaining a view so pernicious.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly he did,<br />
					was his avowal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Almsmen plied Sati with question,<br />
					enquiry,<br />
					and argument<br />
					so as to wean him from his error.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not, they said,<br />
					do not say this;<br />
					do not misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					there are no grounds whatever for such a charge;<br />
					the Lord would not say such a thing.</p>

					<p class="f4">(On the contrary),<br />
					in many a figure has it been laid down by the Lord<br />
					that consciousness only arises by causation<br />
					and that, without assignable conditions,<br />
					consciousness does not come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, say what they would,<br />
					Sati would not yield to their expostulations<br />
					but stoutly held and clung to his pernicious view<br />
					that, as he understood the Lord's teaching of the Doctrine,<br />
					our consciousness ran on<br />
					and continued without break of identity.</p>

					<p class="f4">So when they had failed to wean Sati from his error,<br />
					the Almsmen went to the Lord<br />
					and laid the whole of the facts before him;<br />
					and he sent an Almsman to summon Sati to his presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When Sati had duly come<br />
					and had taken his seat to one side after due obeisance,<br />
					the Lord asked him whether he was correctly reported<br />
					as entertaining this pernicious view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Sati certainly did hold it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">What, Sati, is the nature of this consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sir, it is that speaking and sentient (Self)<br />
					which experiences the ripened fruits<br />
					of good and bad conduct<br />
					in this or that earlier existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, to whom, foolish man,<br />
					do you aver that I ever so taught the Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have I not, foolish man,<br />
					laid it down in many a figure<br />
					that consciousness only arises by causation<br />
					and that, without assignable conditions,<br />
					consciousness does not come about?</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet you, foolish man,<br />
					employ what you have misunderstood <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> not only to misrepresent me<br />
					but also to undermine yourself<br />
					and breed for yourself<br />
					a store of demerit, -<br />
					to your lasting hurt and harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning then to the Almsmen, the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has this Sati, the fisherman's son,<br />
					got even a spark of illumination<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule?</p>

					<p class="f4">How could he, sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">For, it is not the fact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereat, Sati sat silent and glum,<br />
					with his shoulders hunched up<br />
					and eyes downcast,<br />
					much exercised in his mind<br />
					but finding no words to utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him in this plight,<br />
					the Lord said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, foolish man,<br />
					you shall be shewn up<br />
					in respect of this pernicious view of yours;<br />
					I will question the Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, the Lord said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you understand me ever to have preached the Doctrine<br />
					in the sense of this Almsman Sati,<br />
					who employs what he has misunderstood<br />
					not only to misrepresent me<br />
					but also to undermine himself<br />
					and to breed for himself<br />
					a store of demerit, -<br />
					to his lasting hurt and harm?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">For in many a figure<br />
					has the Lord taught us<br />
					that consciousness only arises by causation<br />
					and that, without assignable conditions,<br />
					consciousness does not come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right;<br />
					you rightly understand my teaching;<br />
					for, indeed, I have, as you say,<br />
					so taught in many a figure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet here is this Sati, the fisherman's son,<br />
					who employs ...<br />
					hurt and harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever form of consciousness arises<br />
					from an assignable condition,<br />
					is known by that condition's name.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the eye and visible shapes condition consciousness,<br />
					that is called visual consciousness;<br />
					and so on with the senses and objects of hearing,<br />
					smelling,<br />
					tasting,<br />
					and touch,<br />
					and of mind with its mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a fire,<br />
					where that which makes the fire burn<br />
					gives the fire its name.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wood makes a wood-fire,<br />
					sticks a stick-fire,<br />
					grass a grass-fire,<br />
					cowdung a cow-dung-fire,<br />
					husks a husk-fire,<br />
					and rubbish a rubbish-fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way, every form of consciousness <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> arising from an assignable cause<br />
					is known by that condition's name.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you recognize, Almsmen,<br />
					an organism as such?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you recognize it<br />
					as the product of a particular sustenance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you recognize that,<br />
					by the cessation of its particular sustenance,<br />
					the organism's nature makes for cessation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does doubt of the fact<br />
					of each of these three points<br />
					lead to perplexity thereon?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does recognition of the fact<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					in the fullness of knowledge,<br />
					dispel that perplexity in each case?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">In each of the three cases,<br />
					is there right recognition,<br />
					if it be in the fullness of knowledge of the fact<br />
					as it really is?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you insist on hugging and cherishing<br />
					this pure and undefiled conception<br />
					and if you refuse to relinquish or part with it, -<br />
					could you realize a state of consciousness<br />
					to cross with,<br />
					but not to keep,<br />
					as <a href="mn.022.chlm.sbb.htm">(Sutta 22)</a> in the Allegory of the Raft?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could you realize that Allegory,<br />
					if, while hugging and cherishing your conception,<br />
					you were yet ready to relinquish and part with it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four Sustenances<br />
					which either maintain existing organisms<br />
					or help those yet to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">First of these is material sustenance,<br />
					coarse or delicate;<br />
					Contact is the second;<br />
					cogitation is the third;<br />
					and perception is the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The derivation,<br />
					origin,<br />
					birth,<br />
					and production<br />
					of all four Sustenances alike<br />
					is Craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving in its turn arises from feeling,<br />
					feeling from Contact,<br />
					Contact from the sensory domains,<br />
					sensory <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> domains from Name and Form,<br />
					Name and Form from consciousness,<br />
					consciousness from plastic forces,<br />
					and these latter from ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, ignorance conditions plastic forces,<br />
					which condition consciousness,<br />
					which conditions Name and Form,<br />
					which condition the sensory domains,<br />
					which condition Contact,<br />
					which conditions feeling,<br />
					which conditions Craving,<br />
					which Conditions dependence,<br />
					which conditions becoming,<br />
					which conditions birth,<br />
					which conditions decay and death,<br />
					with the distractions of grief,<br />
					tribulation,<br />
					and pain of body and mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the uprising<br />
					of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have said that birth conditions decay and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does it, or does it not, condition them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how stands the matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth, sir, does condition decay and death;<br />
					and that is how the matter stands.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have said that becoming conditions birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does it, or does it not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how stands the matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming, sir, does condition birth;<br />
					and that is how the matter stands.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar paragraphs for dependence, etc., down to ignorance.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, Almsmen;<br />
					very good.</p>

					<p class="f4">You and I then agree in affirming that: -</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>This being so,<br />
					that comes about;<br />
					if this arises,<br />
					so does that; -</p>

					<p class="f4">thus, ignorance conditions plastic force ...<br />
					(etc., as above) ...<br />
					the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too it is by the entire and passionless cessation of ignorance<br />
					that the plastic forces cease ...<br />
					(etc., for the successive links in the chain, down to) ...<br />
					the distractions of grief,<br />
					tribulation,<br />
					and pain of body and mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the cessation of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have said that by the cessation of birth,<br />
					decay and death cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they, or do they not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how stands the matter?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> By the cessation of birth,<br />
					decay and death also cease, sir;<br />
					and that is how the matter stands.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar paragraphs for becoming, etc., down to ignorance.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Good; very good.</p>

					<p class="f4">You and I then agree in affirming that: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This not being so,<br />
					that comes not about;<br />
					if this ceases,<br />
					so does that; -</p>

					<p class="f4">thus with the cessation of ignorance<br />
					the plastic forces cease ...<br />
					(etc., for the successive links in the chain, down to) ...<br />
					cessation of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Almsmen, would you,<br />
					knowing and seeing all this,<br />
					hark back to the past, wondering<br />
					(i) whether you were, or whether you were not,<br />
					in existence during bygone ages,<br />
					(ii) what you were in those ages,<br />
					(iii) how you fared then, and<br />
					(iv) from what you passed on to what else?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, would you,<br />
					knowing and seeing all this,<br />
					hark forward to the future, wondering<br />
					(i) whether you will, or whether you will not,<br />
					be in existence during the ages to come,<br />
					(ii) what you will be in those ages,<br />
					(iii) how you will fare then, and<br />
					(iv) from what you will pass on to what else?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, would you,<br />
					knowing and seeing all this,<br />
					be perplexed in the present<br />
					about whether or not you exist,<br />
					what and how you are,<br />
					whence your being came,<br />
					and whither it will go?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, knowing and seeing all this, say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">We revere our teacher,<br />
					and it is because of our reverence for him<br />
					that we affirm this?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, knowing and seeing all this, say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Oh, we were told this<br />
					by a recluse or recluses;<br />
					we do not affirm it ourselves?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, knowing and seeing all this,<br />
					look out for another teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, knowing and seeing all this,<br />
					frequent <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> the ritual<br />
					and shows<br />
					and functions<br />
					of the ordinary run of recluses and brahmins<br />
					as being of the essence?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you not affirm<br />
					only what you have of yourselves known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					and discerned?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have by me been introduced to this Doctrine,<br />
					which is immediate in its gifts here and now,<br />
					which is open to all,<br />
					which is a guide Onwards,<br />
					which can be mastered for himself<br />
					by every intelligent man.</p>

					<p class="f4">All I have said<br />
					was to bring out<br />
					that this Doctrine was immediate in its gifts here and now,<br />
					open to all,<br />
					a guide Onwards<br />
					to be mastered for himself<br />
					by every intelligent man.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by the conjunction of three things<br />
					that conception comes about.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there is coitus of parents<br />
					but if that is not the mother's period<br />
					and if there is no presiding deity of generation (gandhabba) present, -<br />
					then no conception takes place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or if there be coitus of parents<br />
					at the mother's period<br />
					but with no presiding deity present, -<br />
					again there is no conception.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if there be a conjunction of all three factors,<br />
					then and only then<br />
					does conception take place.</p>

					<p class="f4">For nine or ten months<br />
					the mother carries the heavy burden of the foetus<br />
					in her womb with great anxiety;<br />
					and with great anxiety<br />
					does she at the end of her time<br />
					bring forth her child.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is born,<br />
					she feeds it with her life-blood, -<br />
					as a mother's milk is termed<br />
					in the Rule of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the boy grows and develops his faculties,<br />
					he plays childish games -<br />
					such as toy ploughs,<br />
					tip-cat,<br />
					head-over-heels,<br />
					windmills,<br />
					pannets,<br />
					little carts,<br />
					and toy bows.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As he grows older<br />
					and as his faculties develop,<br />
					pleasures of sense take hold<br />
					and possession of him,<br />
					visible shapes through the eye,<br />
					sounds through the ear,<br />
					and so on for odours,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					and touch, -<br />
					all of them desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasing<br />
					and attractive.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sight of <a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> shapes<br />
					awakens a passion for attractive shapes<br />
					and a repugnance to the unattractive;<br />
					his life has no collectedness<br />
					as regards the body,<br />
					and mental poverty is his;<br />
					he knows not that real Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					whereby evil and wrong states of consciousness cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">A prey thus to fascinations<br />
					and to dislikes,<br />
					he rejoices in,<br />
					and welcomes,<br />
					and cleaves to,<br />
					every feeling -<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					or indifferent -<br />
					which he experiences,<br />
					so that feelings bring delight;<br />
					delight brings dependence;<br />
					dependence conditions becoming;<br />
					becoming conditions birth;<br />
					birth conditions decay and death,<br />
					with the distractions of grief,<br />
					tribulation,<br />
					and pain of body and mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the uprising of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with visible shapes,<br />
					so too ... with sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					touch<br />
					and mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, Almsmen,<br />
					that here in the world<br />
					there appears a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened, ...<br />
					(etc. as in <a href="mn.027.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 27,</a> down to) ...<br />
					right states of consciousness<br />
					have purged his heart of all doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has put from him the Five Hindrances,<br />
					those defilements of the heart<br />
					which weaken a man's insight,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of mind,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in succession<br />
					he wins the Second,<br />
					the Third,<br />
					and the Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">No shapes,<br />
					or sounds,<br />
					or odours,<br />
					or tastes,<br />
					or touch,<br />
					or mental objects<br />
					now awaken in him<br />
					either likes or dislikes;<br />
					he neither rejoices in,<br />
					nor welcomes,<br />
					nor cleaves to<br />
					any feeling -<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					or indifferent -<br />
					which he experiences,<br />
					so that feelings cease to delight him<br />
					and consequently all dependence ceases<br />
					and there ceases the whole succession of becoming,<br />
					birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death,<br />
					with the distractions of grief,<br />
					tribulation,<br />
					and pain of body and mind. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the cessation of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> Treasure in your memories, Almsmen,<br />
