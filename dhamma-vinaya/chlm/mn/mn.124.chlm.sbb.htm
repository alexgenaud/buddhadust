					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Bakkula was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					an ancient friend of his lay days,<br />
					Acela Kassapa,<br />
					<a id="pt125" href="../../pali/mn/mn.124.pali.bd.htm#pg125"><span class="f2">[125]</span></a> came to him<br />
					and after greetings<br />
					took a seat to one side,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg227"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span></a> It is eighty years, sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the course of those eighty years, Bakkula,<br />
					how often have you lain with women?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You should not ask your question like that,<br />
					Kassapa;<br />
					you should ask how often in the past<br />
					carnal desires have arisen within me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, Bakkula,<br />
					in the course of those eighty years<br />
					how often have carnal desires arisen within you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">During the whole of my eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I am not aware of their once arising.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[This too we Almsmen in conclave assembled<br />

					<p class="f4">During the whole of those eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I do not admit that thoughts of lust -<br />
					or of malevolence -<br />

					have once arisen within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Bakkula,<br />
					I ask to be admitted and confirmed<br />
 					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nor was it long after his confirmation<br />
 					before the reverend Kassapa,<br />

					won the prize in quest of which<br />
 					young men go forth from home to homelessness,<br />
					that prize of prizes<br />
 					which crowns the highest life; -<br />
 					even this did he think out for himself,<br />

					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what I have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus the reverend Kassapa too<br />
 					was numbered among the arahats.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Time came when the reverend Bakkula went<br />
 					key in hand<br />
 					from cell to cell,<br />
					saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, reverend sirs, come;<br />
					to-day 1 shall pass away.</p>
