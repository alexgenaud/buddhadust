					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Bakkula was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					an ancient friend of his lay days,<br />
					Acela Kassapa,<br />
					<a id="pt125" href="../../pali/mn/mn.124.pali.bd.htm#pg125"><span class="f2">[125]</span></a> came to him<br />
					and after greetings<br />
					took a seat to one side,<br />
					asking how long he had been an Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg227"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span></a> It is eighty years, sir,<br />
					since I first became an Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the course of those eighty years, Bakkula,<br />
					how often have you lain with women?</p>

					<p class="f4">You should not ask your question like that,<br />
					Kassapa;<br />
					you should ask how often in the past<br />
					carnal desires have arisen within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, Bakkula,<br />
					in the course of those eighty years<br />
					how often have carnal desires arisen within you?</p>

					<p class="f4">During the whole of my eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I am not aware of their once arising.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[This too we Almsmen in conclave assembled<br />
					account a wonder and a marvel in the reverend Bakkula<br />
					that he is not aware of carnal desires<br />
					having once arisen within him during eighty years.]</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">During the whole of those eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I am not aware that malevolence<br />
					or a desire to hurt<br />
					has once arisen within me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[This too we Almsmen in conclave assembled account a wonder and a marvel in the reverend Bakkula that he is not aware of malevolence or a desire to hurt having once arisen within him during eighty years.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">During the whole of those eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I do not admit that thoughts of lust -<br />
					or of malevolence -<br />
					or of hurt -<br />
					have once arisen within me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt126" href="../../pali/mn/mn.124.pali.bd.htm#pg126"><span class="f2">[126]</span></a> During the whole of those eighty years as an Almsman<br />
					I do not admit having once-accepted a layman's clothes,<br />

					been ill, even triflingly,<br />
 					taken medicine,<br />
					even an opening dose of myrobalan,<br />
					used a head-rest,<br />
					lain on a bed,<br />
					or passed the rainy season within the precincts of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a week I lived,<br />
					still unregenerate,<br />
					on what the country-side furnished,<br />
					but on the eighth day Knowledge came!</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend Bakkula,<br />
					I ask to be admitted and confirmed<br />
 					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor was it long after his confirmation<br />
 					before the reverend Kassapa,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous ardent and purged of self,<br />
					won the prize in quest of which<br />
 					young men go forth from home to homelessness,<br />
					that prize of prizes<br />
 					which crowns the highest life; -<br />
 					even this did he think out for himself,<br />
					realize and attain here and now;<br />
					and to him came the knowledge clear:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the reverend Kassapa too<br />
 					was numbered among the arahats.</p>

					<p class="f4">Time came when the reverend Bakkula went<br />
 					key in hand<br />
 					from cell to cell,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, reverend sirs, come;<br />
					to-day 1 shall pass away.</p>
