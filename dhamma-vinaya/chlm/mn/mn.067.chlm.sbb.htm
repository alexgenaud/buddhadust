					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Cātumā<br />
					in the myrobalan wood,<br />
					there came to visit him five hundred Almsmen<br />
					headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">These newcomers,<br />
					while they were being greeted by the resident Almsmen<br />
					and were being shown their billets<br />
					and while they were <a id="pg325"><span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span></a> putting away their bowls and robes,<br />
					talked loud<br />
					and made a great noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord to the reverend Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Who pray are these loud-voiced noisy persons,<br />
					like so many fishermen over their catch?</p>

					<p class="f4">There have come to visit you, sir,<br />
					five hundred Almsmen headed ...<br />
					a great noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell them from me, Ānanda,<br />
					that the Master desires their presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda having duly done so,<br />
					those Almsmen obediently <a id="pt457" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg457"><span class="f2">[457]</span></a> came to the Lord<br />
					and with proper salutations<br />
					took their seats to one side,<br />
					there to be asked why there was all this clamour and noise,<br />
					as of so many fishermen over their catch.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was these five hundred Almsmen, sir,<br />
					headed ... a great noise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Depart, Almsmen; I bid you begone;<br />
					you cannot dwell near me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said they obediently,<br />
					as, rising up from their seats,<br />
					they took reverential leave of the Lord,<br />
					folded up their bedding,<br />
					took their bowls and robes,<br />
					and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					were met together in their moot-hall<br />
					on some business or other;<br />
					and, when from a distance<br />
					they observed these Almsmen going away,<br />
					they went up to them<br />
					and asked where they were going.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord, sirs, has bidden us all begone.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Mollify. I know you know what it means, but do you know what it means? &gt; L. <i>molli</i> = soft. To soften.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Sit down for a while, reverend sirs;<br />
					we may be able to mollify the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">So these Almsmen sat down<br />
					while the Sakyans of Cātumā went off to the Lord<br />
					and, seating themselves after salutations,<br />
					spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord show favour to the Almsmen<br />
					and extend a welcome to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in the past the Lord has been kindly to the Confraternity,<br />
					so let him be kindly to them now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among them, sir, are young recruits<br />
					that have but recently joined<br />
					and are fresh to this Doctrine and Law;<br />
					to these it would be a shock and a set-back,<br />
					if they fail to see the Lord, -<br />
					just as drought to young crops<br />
					<a id="pt458" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg458"><span class="f2">[458]</span></a> or as losing sight of its mother to a young calf.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in <a id="pg326"><span class="f2 g"><b>[326]</b></span></a> the past the Lord has been kindly to them,<br />
					so let him be kindly to them now, -<br />
					showing favour to the Almsmen<br />
					and extending a welcome to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati,<br />
					divining with his own heart<br />
					the thoughts of the Lord's heart,<br />
					vanished from out of his heaven<br />
					to re-appear in the Lord's presence, -<br />
					 as easily as a strong man might stretch out his arm<br />
					or draw back his outstretched arm.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his right shoulder respectfully bared,<br />
					Brahmā stretched forth folded palms<br />
					in homage towards the Lord, saying,<br />
					as the Sakyans had said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord shew favour ...<br />
					a welcome to them.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt459" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg459"><span class="f2">[459]</span></a>	Now the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					and Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					by their illustrations from young crops<br />
					and the young calf<br />
					succeeded in mollifying the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna to those Almsmen:</p>

					<p class="f4">Arise, sirs, and take up your bowls and robes;<br />
					the Sakyans of Cātumā<br />
					and Brahmā Sahampati<br />
					have succeeded in mollifying the Lord<br />
					by illustrations from young crops<br />
					and the young calf.</p>

					<p class="f4">So at his bidding the Almsmen arose,<br />
					took up their bowls and robes,<br />
					went to the Lord,<br />
					saluted him<br />
					and took their seats to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta was sitting hard by,<br />
					and the Lord asked him what he had thought<br />
					when those Almsmen were sent away.</p>

					<p class="f4">I thought, said Sāriputta,<br />
					that the Lord did not want to be troubled just then<br />
					but to enjoy present bliss,<br />
					and that we too would do the same.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Go away. 'Get on with you!' 'Forget that!' 'No way!'</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Go away, Sāriputta;<br />
					go away<br />
					and never let such an idea cross your mind again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning to Moggallāna,<br />
					the Lord asked him the same question<br />
					and received the answer that he had thought,<br />
					when those Almsmen were sent away,<br />
					that the Lord did not want to be troubled just then<br />
					but to enjoy present bliss,<br />
					and accordingly that he and Sāriputta would look after the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Moggallāna;<br />
					for, either I or you two<br />
					must look after the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, addressing the Almsmen, the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg327"><span class="f2 g"><b>[327]</b></span></a> Four terrors await a man who goes into the water, - namely<br />
					waves,<br />
					crocodiles,<br />
					whirlpools<br />
					and sharks.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just the same four terrors<br />
					await the man who goes forth from home<br />
					to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt460" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg460"><span class="f2">[460]</span></a>	First, what is the terror from waves?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a young man<br />
					who for faith's sake<br />
					has gone forth from home<br />
					to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					feeling beset by birth, decay and death,<br />
					by grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					ills,<br />
					woes<br />
					and tribulation,<br />
					beset by ills<br />
					and spent with ills,<br />
					and asking to be shown how to make an end<br />
					of all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">When enrolled accordingly as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he is plied by his fellows in the higher life<br />
					with orders and with directions, -<br />
					how to approach<br />
					and how to withdraw,<br />
					how to look in front of him<br />
					and how to look behind him,<br />
					how to stretch out his arm<br />
					and how to draw it back,<br />
					and how to carry his bowl and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the old days<br />
					before I left home,<br />
					it was I who gave orders and directions to others;<br />
					but these people here<br />
					seem to think they must order me about<br />
					and direct me like my own children and grandchildren.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he throws up his training<br />
					and reverts to the lower state of a layman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to be so terrified by waves<br />
					that he throws up his training<br />
					and reverts to the lower state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Terror of waves signifies temper.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is terror of crocodiles?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case ot a young man ...<br />
					sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">When enrolled accordingly as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he is plied by his fellows in the higher life<br />
					with orders and directions -<br />
					to eat this but not that,<br />
					to touch this but not that,<br />
					to drink this but not that,<br />
					and each according to rule<br />
					at an appointed hour only,<br />
					and never out of hours.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt461" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg461"><span class="f2">[461]</span></a> Thinks he to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the old days before I left home,<br />
					I used to eat and drink what I liked<br />
					and not to eat or drink what I did not like,<br />
					without any regard to rules and hours at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nowadays, however,<br />
					when faith moves people to give me a good meal<br />
					to eat late in the day<br />
					out of hours,<br />
					methinks these people here bolt<br />
					and bar my mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he throws up his training<br />
					and reverts to the lower state of a layman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to <a id="pg328"><span class="f2 g"><b>[328]</b></span></a> do so from terror of crocodiles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Terror of crocodiles signifies gluttony.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is terror of whirlpools?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a young man ...<br />
					sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">When enrolled accordingly as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he goes for alms in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into a village or township,<br />
					unguarded of body and speech,<br />
					without having mustered up mindfulness,<br />
					and with his faculties not under control.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a householder<br />
					or his son<br />
					indulging in the five pleasures of sense<br />
					to which they are addicted and devoted;<br />
					and the thought comes to him<br />
					that in the old days<br />
					before he left home<br />
					he too used to indulge in these pleasures<br />
					to which he was likewise addicted and devoted<br />
					and that, as his family has plenty of substance,<br />
					he could enjoy that substance<br />
					while doing good works.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he throws up his training<br />
					and reverts to the lower state of a layman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to do so<br />
					from terror of whirlpools.</p>

					<p class="f4">Terror of whirlpools<br />
					signifies the five pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, what is terror of sharks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case <a id="pt462" href="../../pali/mn/mn.067.pali.bd.htm#pg462"><span class="f2">[462]</span></a> of a young man ...<br />
					sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">When enrolled accordingly as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he goes for alms in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into a village or township,<br />
					unguarded of body and speech,<br />
					without having summoned up mindfulness,<br />
					and with his faculties not under control.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sees a woman<br />
					not fully dressed and attired,<br />
					at the sight of whom<br />
					passion defiles his heart<br />
					so that he throws up his training<br />
					and reverts to the lower state of a layman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man is said to do so<br />
					from terror of sharks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Terror of sharks signifies women.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the four terrors<br />
					which await those who,<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
