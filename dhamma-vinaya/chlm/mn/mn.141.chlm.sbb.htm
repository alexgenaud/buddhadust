					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Benares<br />
					in the Isipatana Deer Park,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">It was here in this very Deer Park at Benares<br />
					that the Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					set a-rolling the supreme Wheel of the Doctrine -<br />
					which shall not be turned back from its onward course<br />
					by recluse or brahmin,<br />
					god or Māra or Brahmā<br />
					or by anyone in the universe, -<br />
					the announcement of the Four Noble Truths,<br />
					the teaching,<br />
					declaration<br />
					and establishment<br />
					of those Four Truths,<br />
					with their unfolding,<br />
					exposition and manifestation.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are these four? -<br />
					The announcement,<br />
					teaching ... and manifestation<br />
					of the Noble Truth of Ill -<br />
					of the origin of Ill -<br />
					of the cessation of Ill -<br />
					of the path that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Follow, Almsmen,<br />
					Sāriputta and Moggallāna<br />
					and be guided by them;<br />
					they are wise helpers<br />
					unto their fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like a mother is Sāriputta;<br />
					like a child's wet-nurse is Moggallāna. Sāriputta trains in the fruits of conversion;<br />
					Moggallāna trains in the highest good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta is able to announce,<br />
					teach ... and manifest the Four Noble Truths<br />
					in all their details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Haying thus spoken,<br />
					the Blessed One arose and went into his own cell.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt249" href="../../pali/mn/mn.141.pali.bd.htm#pg249"><span class="f2">[249]</span></a> The Lord had not been gone long<br />
					when the reverend Sāriputta<br />
					proceeded to the exposition of the Truth-finder's Four Noble Truths,<br />
					as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">What, reverend sirs,<br />
					is the Noble Truth of Ill? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is an Ill;<br />
					decay is an Ill;<br />
					death is an Ill;<br />
					grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					misery and tribulation are Ills;<br />
					it is an Ill not to get what is desired; -<br />
					in brief all the factors of the fivefold grip on existence are Ills.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is, for living creatures of each several class,<br />
					the being born or produced,<br />
					the issue,<br />
					the arising<br />
					or <a id="pg297"><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></a> the re-arising,<br />
					the appearance of the plastic forces,<br />
					the growth of faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay, for living creatures of each several class,<br />
					is the decay and decaying,<br />
					loss of teeth,<br />
					grey hair,<br />
					wrinkles,<br />
					a dwindling term of life,<br />
					sere faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Death, for living creatures of each several class,<br />
					is the passage and passing hence,<br />
					the dissolution,<br />
					disappearance,<br />
					dying,<br />
					death,<br />
					decease,<br />
					the dissolution of the plastic forces,<br />
					the discarding of the dead body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grief is the grief,<br />
					grieving and grievousness,<br />
					the inward grief and inward anguish<br />
					of anyone who suffers under some misfortune<br />
					or is in the grip of some type of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lamentation is the lament and lamentation<br />
					<a id="pt250" href="../../pali/mn/mn.141.pali.bd.htm#pg250"><span class="f2">[250]</span></a> the wailing and the lamenting<br />
					of anyone who suffers under some misfortune<br />
					or is in the grip of some type of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pain is any bodily Ill or bodily evil,<br />
					any Ill bred of bodily contact,<br />
					any evil feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Misery is mental Ill and evil,<br />
					any evil feeling of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tribulation is the tribulation of heart and mind,<br />
					the state to which tribulation brings them,<br />
					in anyone who suffers under some misfortune<br />
					or is in the grip of some type of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">There remains not to get what is desired.</p>

					<p class="f4">In creatures subject to birth -<br />
					or decay -<br />
					or death -<br />
					or grief and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					misery and tribulation -<br />
					the desire arises not to be subject thereto<br />
					but to escape them.</p>

					<p class="f4">But escape is not to be won<br />
					merely by desiring it;<br />
					and failure to win it is another Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are in brief<br />
					all the factors of the fivefold grip on existence<br />
					which are Ills? -</p>

					<p class="f4">They are:<br />
					The factors of form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The foregoing, sirs,<br />
					constitutes the Noble Truth of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">What now is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is any craving<br />
					that makes for re-birth<br />
					and is tied up with passion's delights<br />
					and culls satisfaction now here now there; -<br />
					such as the craving for sensual pleasure,<br />
					the craving for continuing existence,<br />
					<a id="pt251" href="../../pali/mn/mn.141.pali.bd.htm#pg251"><span class="f2">[251]</span></a> and the craving for annihilation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg298"><span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span></a> Next, what is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Ill? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the utter and passionless cessation<br />
					of this same craving, -<br />
					the abandonment and rejection of craving,<br />
					Deliverance from craving,<br />
					and aversion from craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, what is the Noble Truth of the Path that leads to the Cessation of Ill? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the Noble Eightfold Path,<br />
					consisting of -<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right resolves,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right acts,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					right endeavour,<br />
					right mindfulness and<br />
					right rapture of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right outlook is to know Ill,<br />
					the origin of III,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the path that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right resolves are<br />
					the resolve to renounce the world<br />
					and to do no hurt or harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right speech is<br />
					to abstain from lies and slander,<br />
					from reviling,<br />
					and from tattle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right acts are<br />
					to abstain from taking life,<br />
					from stealing<br />
					and from lechery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right livelihood is<br />
					that by which the disciple of the Noble One supports himself,<br />
					to the exclusion of wrong modes of livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right endeavour is<br />
					when an Almsman brings his will to bear,<br />
					puts forth endeavour and energy,<br />
					struggles and strives with all his heart,<br />
					to stop bad and wrong qualities<br />
					which have not yet arisen<br />
					from ever arising,<br />
					to renounce those which have already arisen,<br />
					to foster good qualities<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					<a id="pt252" href="../../pali/mn/mn.141.pali.bd.htm#pg252"><span class="f2">[252]</span></a>,<br />
					and, finally, to establish,<br />
					clarify,<br />
					multiply,<br />
					enlarge,<br />
					develop,<br />
					and perfect those good qualities<br />
					which are there already.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right mindfulness is<br />
					when realizing what the body is, -<br />
					what feelings are -<br />
					what the heart is -<br />
					and what the mental states are, -<br />
					an Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alert and mindful,<br />
					in freedom from the wants and discontents<br />
					attendant on any of these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right rapture of concentration is<br />
					when, divested of lusts and divested of wrong dispositions,<br />
					an Almsman develops,<br />
					and dwells in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of aloofness<br />
					and not <a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">By laying to rest observation and reflection,<br />
					he develops and dwells in inward serenity,<br />
					in focussing of heart,<br />
					in the zest and satisfaction<br />
					of the Second Ecstasy,<br />
					which is divorced from observation and reflection<br />
					and is bred of concentration</p>

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, sirs, constitutes the Noble Truth of the Path that leads to the Cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, reverend sirs,<br />
					is the announcement ... and manifestation of the Four Noble Truths, -<br />
					the supreme Wheel of the Doctrine<br />
					set a-rolling in the Deer Park at Benares by the Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					that Wheel which shall not be turned back from its onward course<br />
					by recluse or brahmin,<br />
					god,<br />
					Māra or Brahmā,<br />
					or by anyone in the whole universe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the reverend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the reverend Sāriputta had said.</p>
