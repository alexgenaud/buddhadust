					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was making an alms-pilgrimage through Kosala<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen,<br />
					there was living at Caṇḍala- <a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> kappa the brahmin lady Dhānañjānī,<br />
					who was a staunch believer in the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Chancing to trip up,<br />
					she exclaimed three times:</p>

					<p class="f4">Glory be to the Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt210" href="../../pali/mn/mn.100.pali.bd.htm#pg210"><span class="f2">[210]</span></a>	Her	exclamation	was heard by the young brahmin Sangārava,<br />
					then living in Caṇḍala-kappa,<br />
					who was versed in all three Yedas,<br />
					accomplished in the ritual with the glosses,<br />
					in phonology and in etymology,<br />
					with chronicles as a fifth branch,<br />
					as well as in exegesis,<br />
					in casuistry and in the signs that mark the Superman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing her exclamation,<br />
					he said she was low and degraded<br />
					to extol a shaveling of a recluse<br />
					when there were brahmins available.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah, but you do not know<br />
					how good and wise the Lord is;<br />
					if you did,<br />
					you would not think it right<br />
					to abuse and denounce him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, madam;<br />
					please let me know when the recluse Gotama visits Caṇḍala-kappa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will, said she.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the course of his alms-pilgrimage through Kosala<br />
					the Lord came to Caṇḍala-kappa,<br />
					and took up his abode<br />
					in the mango-grove of the Todeyya brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">News of his arrival there reached the brahmin lady,<br />
					who duly told the young brahmin,<br />
					bidding him select his own time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, Sangārava went to the Lord<br />
					and, after exchange of greetings,<br />
					<a id="pt211" href="../../pali/mn/mn.100.pali.bd.htm#pg211"><span class="f2">[211]</span></a> sat down to one side,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmins, Gotama,<br />
					who by insight here and now<br />
					claim to have won the goal<br />
					and achieved perfection,<br />
					recognizing the foundations<br />
					on which the higher life is based.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the reverend Gotama stand to these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are differences, in my view,<br />
					among such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some of them depend on tradition<br />
					and claim by tradition<br />
					to win the goal<br />
					and the foundations of the higher life, -<br />
					such as the brahmins who know the Three Vedas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Others go on a modicum of belief, -<br />
					such as sophists and researchers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Beyond these are those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who in domains till then unknown<br />
					have, unaided, discerned a Doctrine<br />
					and so have by insight here and now<br />
					won the goal<br />
					and <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> achieved perfection,<br />
					recognizing the foundations<br />
					on which the higher life is based.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of these latter am I;<br />
					or, you may put it,<br />
					I am of them<br />
					in so far as they are truly such.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the days before my Enlightenment,<br />
					when as yet I was but a Bodhisatta<br />
					without full Enlightenment,<br />
					I bethought me that a hole-and-corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas a Pilgrim is free as air;<br />
					it is hard for the home-keeping man<br />
					to follow the higher life<br />
					in all its completeness and purity and perfection;<br />
					come let me cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robe<br />
					and go forth home to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt212" href="../../pali/mn/mn.100.pali.bd.htm#pg212"><span class="f2">[212]</span></a> So the time came that,<br />
					while I was quite young -<br />
					with a wealth of coal-black hair<br />
					untouched by grey<br />
					and in all the beauty of my early prime -<br />
					despite the wishes of my parents,<br />
					who wept and lamented -<br />
					cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes<br />
					and went forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">A pilgrim now,<br />
					in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Āḷāra Kālāma and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					to lead the higher life in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, venerable sir,<br />
					was his answer;<br />
					my Doctrine is such<br />
					that ere long an intelligent man<br />
					can for himself discern,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the full scope of his master's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had his Doctrine by heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far as regards mere lip-recital<br />
					and oral repetition,<br />
					I could say off the (founder's) original message<br />
					and the elders' exposition of it,<br />
					and could profess,<br />
					with others,<br />
					that I knew and saw it to the full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it struck me<br />
					that it was no Doctrine merely accepted by him on trust<br />
					that Āḷāra Kālāma, preached,<br />
					but one which he professed to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after having discerned and realized it for himself;<br />
					and assuredly he had real knowledge and vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to him<br />
					and asked him<br />
					up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized the Doctrine<br />
					he had entered on<br />
					and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of Naught,<br />
					answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Āḷāra Kālāma was not alone in possessing faith,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					rapt concentration,<br />
					and intellectual insight;<br />
					for, all these were mine too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, I asked myself,<br />
					should not I strive to realize the Doctrine<br />
					which he claims to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after discerning and realizing it for himself?</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had discerned<br />
					and realized his Doctrine for myself<br />
					and had entered on it<br />
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I went to him<br />
					and asked him whether this was the point<br />
					up to which he had discerned and realized for himself<br />
					the Doctrine which he professed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said yes;<br />
					and I said that I had reached the same point for myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing, said he,<br />
					a very great thing for us,<br />
					that in you, reverend sir,<br />
					we find such a fellow in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same Doctrine which I for myself have discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have you for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and abide in;<br />
					and that same Doctrine<br />
					which you have for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have I for myself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Doctrine which I know,<br />
					you too know;<br />
					and the Doctrine which you know,<br />
					I too know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					and as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir,<br />
					let us be joint wardens of this company!</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did Āḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					being my master,<br />
					set me, his pupil,<br />
					on precisely the same footing as himself<br />
					and show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of Naught<br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it<br />
					to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend sir,<br />
					to lead the higher life<br />
					in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, ... vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta<br />
					and asked him up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized<br />
					the Doctrine he had entered on and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of neither perception nor nonperception, answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Uddaka Rāmaputta was not alone<br />
					in possessing faith ... show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came, in the course of an alms-pilgrimage through Magadha,<br />
					to the Camp township at Uruvela<br />
					and there took up my abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said I to myself on surveying the place: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly a delightful spot,<br />
					with its goodly groves<br />
					and clear flowing river<br />
					with ghats and amenities,<br />
					hard by a village for sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What more for his striving<br />
					can a young man need<br />
					whose heart is set on striving?</p>

					<p class="f4">So there I sat me down,<br />
					needing nothing further for my striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Howbeit, there flashed in on me spontaneously<br />
					three allegories,<br />
					unknown till then:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a green sappy stick in the water,<br />
					and a man came along with his drill-stick,<br />
					set on lighting a fire and making a blaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could succeed<br />
					by rubbing with his drill-stick<br />
					that green sappy stick from the water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Toil and moil as he may, he couldn't; -<br />
					because the stick is green and sappy in itself,<br />
					and moreover had been in the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is not lived aloof from pleasures of sense<br />
					in the matter of their bodies,<br />
					and who have not inwardly discarded<br />
					and rightly quelled the appetite,<br />
					taste,<br />
					infatuation,<br />
					thirst,<br />
					and feverish longing for pleasures of sense; -<br />
					they are alike incapable of understanding,<br />
					vision,<br />
					and the plenitude of Enlightenment,<br />
					whether or not paroxysms of unpleasant,<br />
					acute,<br />
					and painful feelings assail them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the first allegory,<br />
					unknown till then,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second allegory<br />
					was of a green sappy stick<br />
					lying on dry land.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think the man could light his fire with that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Toil and moil as he may, he couldn't; -<br />
					because, though the stick had been thrown<br />
					not into the water but on dry land,<br />
					yet it is green and sappy in itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same<br />
					with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is not lived aloof ...<br />
					painful feelings assail them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the second allegory,<br />
					till then unknown,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The third allegory<br />
					was of a dry stick,<br />
					with the sap out of it,<br />
					lying on dry ground,<br />
					with a man coming along with his drill-stick,<br />
					bent on lighting a fire<br />
					and making a blaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could light his fire<br />
					with that dry stick?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he could; -<br />
					because the stick is dry and sapless in itself<br />
					and moreover had not been in the water<br />
					but was lying on dry ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is lived aloof from pleasures of sense<br />
					in the matter of their bodies,<br />
					and who have inwardly discarded<br />
					and rightly quelled the appetite,<br />
					taste,<br />
					infatuation,<br />
					thirst,<br />
					and feverish longing for pleasures of sense; -<br />
					they are alike capable of understanding,<br />
					vision,<br />
					and the plenitude of Enlightenment,<br />
					whether or not paroxysms of unpleasant,<br />
					acute<br />
					and painful feelings assail them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the third and last of the three allegories,<br />
					till then unknown,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I then to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me,<br />
					with teeth clenched<br />
					and with tongue pressed against my palate,<br />
					by sheer force of mind<br />
					restrain,<br />
					coerce,<br />
					and dominate my heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this I did,<br />
					till the sweat streamed from my armpits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man,<br />
					taking a weaker man by the head or shoulders,<br />
					restrains and coerces and dominates him,<br />
					even so did I,<br />
					with teeth clenched<br />
					and with tongue pressed against my palate,<br />
					by sheer force of mind<br />
					restrain,<br />
					coerce,<br />
					and dominate my heart,<br />
					till the sweat streamed from my armpits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance<br />
					which never quailed;<br />
					there was established in me<br />
					a mindfulness which knew no distraction, -<br />
					though my body was sore distressed and afflicted,<br />
					because I was harassed by these struggles<br />
					as I painfully struggled on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet even such unpleasant feelings as then arose<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought 1 to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I stopped breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose;<br />
					and then great was the noise of the air<br />
					as it passed through my ear-holes,<br />
					like the blast from a smith's bellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue further<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I stopped breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent winds wracked my head,<br />
					as though a strong man were boring into my skull with the point of a sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue still further<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping all breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent pains attacked my head,<br />
					as though a strong man had twisted a leather thong round my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me go on pursuing the Ecstasy<br />
					that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent winds pierced my inwards through and through, -<br />
					as though an expert butcher<br />
					or his man<br />
					were hacking my inwards with sharp cleavers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me still go on pursuing<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping all breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then there was a violent burning within me, -<br />
					as though two strong men,<br />
					taking a weaker man by both arms,<br />
					were to roast and burn him up in a fiery furnace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight of me,<br />
					some gods said I was dead;<br />
					others said I was not dead but dying;<br />
					while others again said that I was an Arahat<br />
					and that Arahats lived like that!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me proceed to cut off food altogether.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, gods came to me<br />
					begging me not so to do,<br />
					or else they would feed me through the pores<br />
					with heavenly essences<br />
					which would keep me alive.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, thought I to myself,<br />
					while I profess to be dispensing with all food whatsoever,<br />
					these gods should feed me all the time through the pores<br />
					with heavenly essences which keep me alive,<br />
					that would be imposture on my part.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I rejected their offers, peremptorily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me restrict myself to little tiny morsels of food at a time,<br />
					namely the liquor in which beans or vetches,<br />
					peas or pulse,<br />
					have been boiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">I rationed myself accordingly,<br />
					and my body grew emaciated in the extreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">My members, great and small,<br />
					grew like the knotted joints of withered creepers;<br />
					like a buffalo's hoof<br />
					were my shrunken buttocks;<br />
					like the twists in a rope<br />
					were my spinal vertebrae;<br />
					like the crazy rafters<br />
					of a tumbledown roof,<br />
					that start askew and aslant,<br />
					were my gaunt ribs;<br />
					like the starry gleams on water<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of a well,<br />
					shone my gleaming eyes<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of their sockets;<br />
					and as the rind of a cut gourd<br />
					shrinks and shrivels in the heat,<br />
					so shrank and shrivelled<br />
					the scalp of my head, -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I sought to feel my belly,<br />
					it was my backbone<br />
					which I found in my grasp;<br />
					if I sought to feel my backbone,<br />
					I found myself grasping my belly,<br />
					so closely did my belly cleave to my backbone; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I wanted to retire<br />
					for the calls of nature,<br />
					down I fell on my face; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If for ease of body<br />
					I chafed my limbs,<br />
					the hairs of my body<br />
					fell away under my hand,<br />
					rotted at their roots; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight of me,<br />
					some men said I was black;<br />
					others said I was brown;<br />
					while others again said I was neither black nor brown,<br />
					but dusky like a fish.</p>

					<p class="f4">To such a sorry pass<br />
					had my pure clear complexion been reduced, -<br />
					all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of all the spasms of acute and severe pain<br />
					that have been undergone through the ages past -<br />
					or will be undergone through the ages to come -<br />
					or are now being undergone -<br />
					by recluses or brahmins,<br />
					mine are pre-eminent;<br />
					nor is there aught worse beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, with all these severe austerities,<br />
					I fail to transcend ordinary human limits<br />
					and to rise to the heights<br />
					of noblest understanding and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be another path to Enlightenment?</p>

					<p class="f4">A memory came to me<br />
					of how once,<br />
					seated in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree<br />
					on the lands of my father the Sakyan,<br />
					I, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and of wrong states of mind,<br />
					entered upon,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy,<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could this be the path to Enlightenment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In prompt response to this memory,<br />
					my consciousness told me<br />
					that here lay the true path to Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I afraid of a bliss<br />
					which eschews pleasures of sense and wrong states of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">And my heart told me I was not afraid.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy matter to attain that bliss<br />
					with a body so emaciated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me take some solid food,<br />
					rice and junket;<br />
					and this I ate accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">With me at the time<br />
					there were the Five Almsmen,<br />
					looking for me to announce to them<br />
					what truth I attained;<br />
					but when I took the rice and junket,<br />
					they left me in disgust,<br />
					saying that luxuriousness had claimed me<br />
					and that, abandoning the struggle,<br />
					I had reverted to luxuriousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Regaining strength after eating solid food,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I rose above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in my frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">With thoughts thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of impure things,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it was thus that I applied my heart to the knowledge which recalled my earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">I called to mind my divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />
					I remembered,<br />
					such and such was my name,<br />
					my sept,<br />
					my class,<br />
					my diet,<br />
					my joys and sorrows,<br />
					and my term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed thence,<br />
					I came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was my name and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I passed to my life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did I call to mind my divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, was the first knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the first watch of that night,-<br />
					ignorance dispelled and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					I now applied to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					I saw beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					I saw them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this did I see with the Eye Celestial;<br />
					and this, brahmin, was the second knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the second watch of that night, -<br />
					ignorance dispelled and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					I next applied to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I comprehended,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					I11,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">I comprehended,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					what the Cankers were,<br />
					with their origin,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I knew this<br />
					and when I saw this,<br />
					then my heart was delivered<br />
					from the Canker of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to me thus delivered<br />
					came the knowledge of my Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction -<br />
					Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me<br />
					there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Brahmin, was the third knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the third watch of that night, -<br />
					ignorance dispelled<br />
					and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon the young brahmin Sangārava said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Fruitful indeed and noble was your striving,<br />
					worthy of an arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">- Now, are there gods?</p>

					<p class="f4">I knew offhand there were gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do you give that answer to my question, Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it not false and untrue?</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyone who, when asked if gods there be,<br />
					answers that there are gods <a id="pt213" href="../../pali/mn/mn.100.pali.bd.htm#pg213"><span class="f2">[213]</span></a><br />
					and that he knew offhand there were, -<br />
					why, anyone of intelligence<br />
					must come irresistibly to the conclusion<br />
					that there are gods.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> Why did you not make this clear at the outset, Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is loud in agreement that there are gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the brahmin Sangārava said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.</p>
