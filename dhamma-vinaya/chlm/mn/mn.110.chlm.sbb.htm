					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the palace of Migara's mother in the Old Pleasaunce at Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Lord was seated,<br />
					as it was the sabbath of the <a id="pt21" href="../../pali/mn/mn.110.pali.bd.htm#pg21"><span class="f2">[21]</span></a> full moon,<br />
					with the Confraternity around him in the moonlight.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Surveying the silent Confraternity<br />
					of silent Almsmen,<br />
					the Lord addressed them as follows:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Can a bad man tell<br />
					that another bad man is bad?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen;<br />
					it is impossible and inadmissible.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen;<br />

					<p class="f4">A bad man is bad in his nature.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> nurtured on bad,<br />
					bad in his thoughts,<br />
					bad in his resolves,<br />
					bad in his speech,<br />
					bad in his doings,<br />
					bad in his views,<br />
					bad in his distribution of alms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his nature? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The bad man is devoid of faith,<br />
					devoid of shame,<br />
					devoid of scruples,<br />
					uninstructed,<br />
					inert,<br />
					unmindful,<br />
					empty of wisdom.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is the bad man nurtured on bad? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He finds his friends and his associates<br />

					<p class="f4">He slays or robs or fornicates.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his views? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He holds the view<br />
