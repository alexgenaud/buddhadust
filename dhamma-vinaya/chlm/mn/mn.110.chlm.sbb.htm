					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the palace of Migara's mother in the Old Pleasaunce at Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Lord was seated,<br />
					as it was the sabbath of the <a id="pt21" href="../../pali/mn/mn.110.pali.bd.htm#pg21"><span class="f2">[21]</span></a> full moon,<br />
					with the Confraternity around him in the moonlight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Surveying the silent Confraternity<br />
					of silent Almsmen,<br />
					the Lord addressed them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a bad man tell<br />
					that another bad man is bad?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen;<br />
					it is impossible and inadmissible.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a bad man tell a good man?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen;<br />
					this too is impossible and inadmissible.</p>

					<p class="f4">A bad man is bad in his nature.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg168"><span class="f2 g"><b>[168]</b></span></a> nurtured on bad,<br />
					bad in his thoughts,<br />
					bad in his resolves,<br />
					bad in his speech,<br />
					bad in his doings,<br />
					bad in his views,<br />
					bad in his distribution of alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his nature? -</p>

					<p class="f4">The bad man is devoid of faith,<br />
					devoid of shame,<br />
					devoid of scruples,<br />
					uninstructed,<br />
					inert,<br />
					unmindful,<br />
					empty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the bad man nurtured on bad? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He finds his friends and his associates<br />
					among such recluses and brahmins<br />
					as are devoid of faith,<br />
					devoid of shame,<br />
					devoid of scruples,<br />
					uninstructed,<br />
					inert,<br />
					unmindful,<br />
					empty of wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the bad man bad in his thoughts? -</p>

					<p class="f4">His thoughts are malevolent to himself,<br />
					malevolent to others,<br />
					malevolent to both himself and others.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his resolves? -</p>

					<p class="f4">In his resolves he is malevolent to himself,<br />
					malevolent to others,<br />
					malevolent to both himself and others.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt22" href="../../pali/mn/mn.110.pali.bd.htm#pg22"><span class="f2">[22]</span></a> How is he bad in his speech? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a liar,<br />
					or a traducer,<br />
					violent in his language<br />
					or a tattler.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his doings? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He slays or robs or fornicates.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he bad in his views? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds the view<br />
					that there is no such thing as alms<br />
					or sacrifice<br />
					or oblations,<br />
					that there is no such thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of deeds good or bad,<br />
					that there is no such thing<br />
					as this world or the next,<br />
					that there are no such things<br />
					as either parents<br />
					or a spontaneous generation elsewhere,<br />
					that there are no such things<br />
					as recluses and brahmins<br />
					who tread the right path<br />
					and walk aright,<br />
					who have,<br />
					of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized this world<br />
					and make it all known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the bad man<br />
					bad in distributing alms? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He is casual in his giving,<br />
					gives neither with his own hand<br />
					nor with consideration,<br />
					gives only the scraps away,<br />
					heedless of retribution to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a bad man<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					passes away to fare<br />
					as bad men fare, -<br />
					in purgatory<br />
					or as a brute beast.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a good man tell a good man, Almsmen?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt28" href="../../pali/mn/mn.110.pali.bd.htm#pg28"><span class="f2">[28]</span></a> Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right;<br />
					it is possible for a good man<br />
					to tell a good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a good man tell a bad man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right;<br />
					it is possible for a good man<br />
					to tell <a id="pg169"><span class="f2 g"><b>[169]</b></span></a> a bad one.</p>

					<p class="f4">A good man is good in his nature,<br />
					nurtured on good,<br />
					good in his thoughts,<br />
					good in his aims,<br />
					good in his speech,<br />
					good in his doings,<br />
					good in his views,<br />
					good in his distribution of alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he good in his nature? -</p>

					<p class="f4">The good man has faith,<br />
					has conscience,<br />
					has scruples,<br />
					is instructed<br />
					zealous<br />
					mindful<br />
					and wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the good man nurtured on good? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He finds his friends and his associates<br />
					among such recluses and brahmins<br />
					as have faith,<br />
					have conscience,<br />
					have scruples,<br />
					are instructed<br />
					zealous<br />
					mindful<br />
					and wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the good man good in his thoughts? -</p>

					<p class="f4">His thoughts are benevolent to himself,<br />
					benevolent to others,<br />
					benevolent to both himself and others.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he good in his aims? -</p>

					<p class="f4">In his aims he is benevolent to himself,<br />
					benevolent to others,<br />
					benevolent to both himself and others.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he good in his speech? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews lying and traducing,<br />
					he eschews violence in his language and tattling.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he good in his doings? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews slaying and robbing <a id="pt24" href="../../pali/mn/mn.110.pali.bd.htm#pg24"><span class="f2">[24]</span></a>	and fornicating.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he good in his views? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He holds that there is such a thing<br />
					as alms and sacrifice and oblations<br />
					that there is such a thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest of deeds good and bad,<br />
					that there is such a thing<br />
					as this world and the next,<br />
					that there are such things<br />
					as parents and a spontaneous generation elsewhere,<br />
					that there are such things<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who tread the right path<br />
					and walk aright,<br />
					who have,<br />
					of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized this world<br />
					and made it all known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the good man good in distributing alms? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He is circumspect in giving,<br />
					gives with his own hand<br />
					and with proper consideration,<br />
					heedful of retribution to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a good man at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					passes away to fare as good men fare, -<br />
					exalted among gods<br />
					or exalted among men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
