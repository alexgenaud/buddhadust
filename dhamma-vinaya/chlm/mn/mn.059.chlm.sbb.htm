					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					Pañcakanga the carpenter<br />
					came to the reverend Udāyi,<br />
					and, having seated himself after salutations, asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">How many classes of feelings does the Lord specify?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, sir, -<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant<br />
					and indifferent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt397" href="../../pali/mn/mn.059.pali.bd.htm#pg397"><span class="f2">[397]</span></a>	No, Udāyi,<br />
					he specifies not three<br />
					but only two classes of feelings, -<br />
					the pleasant and the unpleasant; -<br />
					the indifferent he accounts as the supremely pleasant<br />
					in the case of him who has found peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the second and for a third time<br />
					Udāyi affirmed there were the three classes;<br />
					and a second and a third time<br />
					the carpenter insisted there were only two;<br />
					neither could convince the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their talk was heard by the reverend Ānanda,<br />
					who went off to the Lord and,<br />
					seating himself after salutations,<br />
					related the whole of the talk<br />
					Udāyi and the carpenter had had together.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord to Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">It was a quite correct statement by Udāyi<br />
					which the carpenter rejected,<br />
					and it was a quite correct statement by the carpenter<br />
					which Udāyi rejected.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have specified two classes Of feelings;<br />
					<a id="pt398" href="../../pali/mn/mn.059.pali.bd.htm#pg398"><span class="f2">[398]</span></a><br />
					I have specified three,<br />
					five,<br />
					six,<br />
					eighteen,<br />
					thirty-six<br />
					and a hundred and eight.</p>

							<p>Enuntiate = enunciate. [f.L.  ēnuntiāt ppl. stem of ēnuntiāre, ē = here,  nuntiāre = to announce.] = enounce. To give definite expression to. — O.E.D.,] but why? Spelling 'enunciate' existed as early as 1656.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have so enuntiated the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who refuse to accept,<br />
					receive<br />
					and welcome from others<br />
					correct statements of it<br />
					as enunciated by me,<br />
					must be expected to come to live together in quarrels,<br />
					strife<br />
					and contentions,<br />
					assailing one another with shafts of wounding speech;<br />
					whereas those who accept,<br />
					receive<br />
					and welcome from others<br />
					correct and accurate statements of it<br />
					as I have enuntiated it,<br />
					may be expected to live together in amity,<br />
					harmony<br />
					and concord,<br />
					without quarrelling,<br />
					in happy union,<br />
					viewing one another with eyes of affection.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> Five in number, Ānanda,<br />
					are the pleasures of sense,<br />
					namely,<br />
					material shapes apparent to the eye,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					smells,<br />
					taste<br />
					and touch, -<br />
					all of them pleasant and agreeable and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with passion and lust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Every pleasant gratification<br />
					which arises from these five pleasures of sense<br />
					is called sensual pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, I do not agree with him who should say<br />
					this is the highest pleasure creatures can experience.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I not agree?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, beyond this,<br />
					there is a pleasure far choicer<br />
					and more excellent, -<br />
					which comes when,<br />
					divested of lusts<br />
					and of wrong dispositions,<br />
					an Almsman enters on<br />
					and dwells in<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					in all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor do I agree with him who should say<br />
					that this latter is the highest pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt399" href="../../pali/mn/mn.059.pali.bd.htm#pg399"><span class="f2">[399]</span></a> Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, beyond this,<br />
					there is a pleasure far choicer<br />
					and more excellent, -<br />
					which comes when an Almsman,<br />
					rising above observation and reasoning,<br />
					enters on and dwells in the Second Ecstasy. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... in the Third Ecstasy. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... in the Fourth Ecstasy,<br />
					the state that knows naught pleasant or unpleasant,<br />
					the clarity that comes of poise and collectedness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor do I agree with him who should say<br />
					that this last is the highest pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, beyond this,<br />
					there is a pleasure far choicer<br />
					and more excellent, -<br />
					which comes when,<br />
					by passing altogether beyond perception of material objects,<br />
					by ceasing from perception of sense-reactions,<br />
					and by not heeding perception of differences,<br />
					an Almsman comes to hold space to be infinite<br />
					and so enters on<br />
					and dwells in<br />
					the plane of infinity and space.</p>

					<p class="f4">... plane of infinity of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">... plane of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt400" href="../../pali/mn/mn.059.pali.bd.htm#pg400"><span class="f2">[400]</span></a> ... plane of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor yet do I agree with him who should say<br />
					this <a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> last is the highest pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, beyond this,<br />
					there is a pleasure far choicer<br />
					and more excellent, -<br />
					which comes when, by passing altogether beyond the plane of neither consciousness nor unconsciousness,<br />
					an Almsman enters on<br />
					and dwells in<br />
					the state in which feelings and perceptions are stilled<br />
					and laid to rest for ever.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be, Ānanda,<br />
					that Wanderers belonging to other schools will say:</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama speaks of the stilling of feelings and perceptions,<br />
					and accounts this pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why? and how?</p>

					<p class="f4">Your answer to such should be<br />
					that the Lord does not restrict pleasure<br />
					to pleasant feelings only;<br />
					the truth-finder ranks under pleasure<br />
					all that is pleasant<br />
					wheresoever he descries it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
