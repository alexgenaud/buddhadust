					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the palace of Migāra's mother<br />
					in the Old Pleasaunce at Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Lord was seated,<br />
					as it was the sabbath of the full moon,<br />
					with the Confraternity around him in the moonlight,<br />
					when an Almsman arose<br />
					and respectfully asked<br />
					if he might put a question to the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bidden to resume his seat<br />
					and put his question,<br />
					that Almsman said to the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Are there, sir, five factors of attachment, -<br />
					<a id="pt16" href="../../pali/mn/mn.109.pali.bd.htm#pg16"><span class="f2">[16]</span></a> to wit,<br />
					form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the constituents<br />
					and consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To his grateful thanks<br />
					the Almsman added the further question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From what root do these five factors grow?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From desire.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is attachment identical<br />
					with the factors of attachment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or is there attachment<br />
					apart from the factors?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The answer to the first part of your question is in the negative,<br />
					and in the affirmative to the second part.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The passion of desire in the factors<br />
					constitutes attachment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does that passion of desire, sir,<br />
					vary in the five factors?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take a man whose thought is<br />
					in the hereafter either to have<br />
					this or that form,<br />
					or these or those feelings,<br />
					or these or those perceptions,<br />
					or these or those constituents,<br />
					or this or that consciousness, -<br />
					this is how the passion of desire<br />
					varies in the five factors of attachment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How far, sir,<br />
					can the factors be defined?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The form-factor<br />
					is any form -<br />
					<a id="pt17" href="../../pali/mn/mn.109.pali.bd.htm#pg17"><span class="f2">[17]</span></a> the feeling-factor is any feeling -<br />
					the perception-factor is any perception -<br />
					the constituents-factor is any constituent -<br />
					and the consciousness-factor is any consciousness -<br />
					belonging to past,<br />
					future<br />
					or present,<br />
					internal or external,<br />
					gross <a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> or delicate,<br />
					lowly or debonair,<br />
					far or near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus far, Almsman,<br />
					can the factors be defined.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the cause and condition<br />
					for affirming each of these factors, respectively?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The four prime elements<br />
					(earth, water, fire and air)<br />
					are the cause and condition<br />
					for affirming the form-factor,<br />
					as is Contact (phassa)<br />
					for affirming the feeling-factor,<br />
					the perception-factor<br />
					and the constituents-factor.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Name-and-Form of the individual<br />
					<i>(nāma-rūpa)</i> are the cause and condition<br />
					for affirming the consciousness-factor.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does the Personality view <i>(sakkāya-diṭṭhi)</i> come about?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of the uninstructed everyday man<br />
					who has no vision of the Noble Ones<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in the Doctrine of the Noble Ones,<br />
					who has no vision of the Excellent Ones<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in the Doctrine of the Excellent Ones;<br />
					-such a one views form as Self,<br />
					or Self as possessing form,<br />
					or form in Self,<br />
					or Self in form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He does the same with feeling and perception,<br />
					with the constituents<br />
					and with consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt18" href="../../pali/mn/mn.109.pali.bd.htm#pg18"><span class="f2">[18]</span></a> This is how the Personality view comes about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does it not come about?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an instructed disciple of the Noble Ones,<br />
					who has got vision of the Noble Ones<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who has got vision of the Excellent Ones<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine;<br />
					such a one does not view form as Self,<br />
					nor Self as possessing form,<br />
					nor form in Self,<br />
					nor Self in form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He behaves similarly<br />
					with feeling and perception,<br />
					with the constituents and with consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how the Personality view does not come about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction,<br />
					what is the peril,<br />
					and what is the escape<br />
					in the case of each of the five, respectively?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The satisfaction in form<br />
					is the pleasure and content that arises from form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fact that form is fleeting,<br />
					charged with Ill<br />
					and subject to change<br />
					is form's peril.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> The removal and discarding<br />
					of the passion of desire for form<br />
					is the escape from form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same applies to feeling and the rest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What must a man know and see<br />
					in order that,<br />
					alike in his conscious body<br />
					and externally in phenomena in general,<br />
					there should not come about<br />
					a trend to pride in 'I' and 'mine'?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He sees and fully knows,<br />
					causally and truly,<br />
					that no form whatsoever -<br />
					past present or future,[sic]<br />
					internal or external,<br />
					gross or delicate,<br />
					lowly or <a id="pt19" href="../../pali/mn/mn.109.pali.bd.htm#pg19"><span class="f2">[19]</span></a> debonair,<br />
					far or near -<br />
					is either 'mine'<br />
					or 'I'<br />
					or 'Self of mine.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And this too he sees and knows<br />
					equally of feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					the constituents<br />
					and consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how that trend to pride does not come about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here to another Almsman's mind<br />
					there presented itself<br />
					the following consideration: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So it appears that there is no Self in feeling<br />
					or perception<br />
					or the constituents<br />
					or in consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With what Self<br />
					will self-less happenings find contact?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Reading with his heart<br />
					that Almsman's heart and thoughts,<br />
					the Lord went on to say to the Almsmen: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the case may arise<br />
					that some foolish person,<br />
					without knowledge<br />
					and in his ignorance,<br />
					with a heart dominated by Craving,<br />
					may imagine the Master's teaching<br />
					is to be superseded by the idea that,<br />
					as it appears there is no Self in feeling<br />
					or in perception<br />
					or in the constituents<br />
					or in consciousness,<br />
					with what Self will self-less happenings find contact?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now you, Almsmen,<br />
					who have been by me trained in causal sequence,<br />
					everywhere and in every thing, -<br />
					what do you say?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is form permanent or transient?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Transient, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is the transient a weal or an Ill?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">An Ill, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is it proper to regard<br />
					the transient Ill<br />
					which is the creature of change<br />
					as 'mine' or 'I' or 'my Self'?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is it the same with feeling and the rest?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt20" href="../../pali/mn/mn.109.pali.bd.htm#pg20"><span class="f2">[20]</span></a> Yes, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consequently,<br />
					you have to see and fully know,<br />
 					<a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a> 					causally and truly,<br />
					that no form whatsoever -<br />
 					no feeling whatsoever -<br />
 					no perception whatsoever -<br />
 					no constituents whatsoever -<br />
 					no consciousness whatsoever -<br />
 					be they past present or future,[sic]<br />
					internal or external,<br />
					gross or delicate,<br />
					lowly or debonair,<br />
					far or near, - is either 'mine' or 'I' or 'Self of mine.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing this clearly,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the Noble Ones<br />
 					is aweary of form,<br />
					aweary of feeling,<br />
					aweary of perception,<br />
					aweary of the constituents,<br />
					and aweary of consciousness;<br />
					and,<br />
					being aweary,<br />
					comes to be passionless<br />
 					and by passionlessness finds Deliverance;<br />
					being Delivered,<br />
					he comes to know his Deliverance in the conviction: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what 1 have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">During the course of this exposition,<br />
					the hearts of full sixty Almsmen<br />
 					were by detachment<br />
 					Delivered from the Cankers.</p>
