					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was dwelling among the Sakyans<br />
					in their township of Devadaha,<br />
					he addressed the attentive Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Some recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who affirm and hold the view that,<br />
					whatsoever the individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or unpleasant or neither -<br />
					all comes from former actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hence, by expiation and purge of former misdeeds<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					the misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away;<br />
					and as feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is what the Nigaṇṭhas affirm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consequently, I go to them<br />
					and, after being assured<br />
					that this is a correct version of their view,<br />
					enquire whether they really know<br />
					that they were in existence before this<br />
					and not non-existent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, they don't know,<br />
					is their answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know, I ask them further,<br />
					that in former existences<br />
					you were guilty of misdeeds<br />
					and were not guiltless thereof?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know that then<br />
					you were guilty of such and such a specific misdeed<br />
					and were not guiltless thereof?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg124"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span></a> Do you know that<br />
					so much Ill has already been outworn,<br />
					or that<br />
					so much more remains to be outworn,<br />
					or that,<br />
					when so much Ill has been outworn,<br />
					all Ill will have passed?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know that,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					wrong dispositions have been got rid of<br />
					and right dispositions acquired?</p>
						
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So I understand, sirs,<br />
					that you Nigaṇṭhas have no knowledge<br />
					whether or no you existed before this;<br />
					have no knowledge<br />
					whether or no, in previous existences,<br />
					you were guilty of misdeeds,<br />
					either generally or specifically;<br />
					have no knowledge<br />
					how much Ill within you<br />
					is already outworn<br />
					or how much remains to become outworn<br />
					before all Ill will have worn out;<br />
					and have no knowledge that,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					wrong dispositions have been got rid of<br />
					and right dispositions acquired.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					'twere not proper for Nigaṇṭhas to explain that,<br />
					whatsoever feelings the individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or unpleasant or neither -<br />
					all comes from former actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hence, by expiation and purge of former misdeeds<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					the misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away;<br />
					and as feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Only if you Nigaṇṭhas had,<br />
					as you have not,<br />
					definite knowledge on these several points,<br />
					would it be proper for you to offer the explanation you do offer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt216" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg216"><span class="f2">[216]</span></a> It is just as if a man were pierced by an arrow thickly smeared with poison,<br />
					and his friends and kinsfolk were to get a surgeon skilled in arrow-wounds<br />
					who should cut with a knife the external wound,<br />
					next probe for the barb,<br />
					then extract the barb,<br />
					and finally dress the external wound with medicated embers, -<br />
					causing the patient at each stage<br />
					feelings of acute pain and anguish;<br />
					but later on,<br />
					when the wound has healed and closed up,<br />
					the patient recovers<br />
					and is quite well and comfortable,<br />
					able to look after himself<br />
					and go where he will,<br />
					and fully alive to the foregoing stages<br />
					of his cure <a id="pt217" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg217"><span class="f2">[217]</span></a> and recovery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It would be just the same, Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					with you if you actually knew<br />
					that you existed before this<br />
					and were not non-existent;<br />
					if you actually knew that,<br />
					in previous existences,<br />
					you were guilty of misdeeds,<br />
 					<a id="pg125"><span class="f2 g"><b>[125]</b></span></a> 					either generally or specifically;<br />
					if you actually knew<br />
 					how much Ill is already outworn<br />
 					and how much remains to become outworn<br />
 					before all Ill will have worn out and pass away;<br />
					if you actually knew that,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					wrong dispositions have been got rid of<br />
 					and right dispositions acquired; -<br />
 					then indeed 'twere proper for Nigaṇṭhas to explain that,<br />
					whatsoever feelings the individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or unpleasant or neither -<br />
					all comes from former actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hence, by expiation and purge of former misdeeds<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					the misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away;<br />
					and as feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But as you have not that knowledge,<br />
					'twere not proper to offer the explanation you do offer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon those Nigaṇṭhas told me<br />
					that <a id="pt218" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg218"><span class="f2">[218]</span></a> Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha was all-knowing and all-seeing,<br />
					with nothing beyond his ken and vision,<br />
					and that he affirmed of himself that,<br />
					whether walking or standing,<br />
					sleeping or awake,<br />
					he was always,<br />
					without a break,<br />
					at his spiritual best.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These, they added, were his words: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You have done misdeeds, Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					in past existences;<br />
					wear it out by severe austerities;<br />
					every present restraint<br />
					on body, speech and mind<br />
					will undo the evil-doings of the past;<br />
					hence, by expiation and purge of past misdeeds<br />
					and by not doing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away,<br />
					and as painful feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This doctrine, they added,<br />
					commends itself to us<br />
					and has our approval,<br />
					and we rejoice in it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said I to those Nigaṇṭhas: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here are five qualities<br />
					each of which has here and now<br />
					an alternative outcome, -namely<br />
					faith,<br />
					inclination,<br />
					authority,<br />
					appreciation and intellectual enthusiasm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Herein, what faith have Nigaṇṭhas hitherto shown towards their teacher?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What inclination towards him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What authority do they recognize in him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is their appreciation?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or what intellectual enthusiasm have they?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas;<br />
					I got nothing from them<br />
					in the way of an effectual answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Addressing myself again to those Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					I asked them whether,<br />
					when they were violent in their efforts and strivings,<br />
					they concomitantly experienced <a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> attendant feelings<br />
					of violent pain and anguish,<br />
					and whether, when they ceased from violence of effort,<br />
					they found their violent pain and anguish ceased too.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes; that was what they found in both cases.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt219" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg219"><span class="f2">[219]</span></a> It comes to this then<br />
					that the one goes with the other; -<br />
					with violence of effort<br />
					you suffer pain and anguish,<br />
					whereas without that violence<br />
					you do not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, on this showing<br />
					it would be quite wrong for you Nigaṇṭhas to explain that,<br />
					whatsoever feelings the individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or unpleasant or neither -<br />
					all comes from former actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hence, by expiation and purge of former misdeeds<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					the misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away;<br />
					and as feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same would equally hold good<br />
					if the violent pain and anguish still went on,<br />
					whether you were then violent,<br />
					or had ceased to be violent,<br />
					in your efforts and strivings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But as your attendant pains start with,<br />
					and cease with,<br />
					your violent efforts and strivings,<br />
					you are yourselves the authors<br />
					of your own violent pain and anguish,<br />
					and it is through ignorance,<br />
					lack of knowledge and delusion<br />
					that <a id="pt220" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg220"><span class="f2">[220]</span></a> you torture yourselves<br />
					into the mistaken belief that,<br />
					whatsoever feelings the individual experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant or unpleasant or neither -<br />
					all comes from former actions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hence, by expiation and purge of former misdeeds<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					nothing accrues for the future;<br />
					as nothing accrues for the future,<br />
					the misdeeds die away;<br />
					as misdeeds die away,<br />
					Ill dies away;<br />
					as Ill dies away,<br />
					feelings die away;<br />
					and as feelings die away,<br />
					all Ill will wear out and pass. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas;<br />
					I got nothing from them<br />
					the way of an effectual answer.</p>
					 
					<p class="f4">Addressing myself once again to those Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					I asked them whether it was feasible<br />
					for effort and striving to postpone to a future state<br />
					the fruits of action which ripen here and now?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, they answered.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or vice versâ?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or to turn pleasant fruits of action<br />
					into unpleasant?</p>
						
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
						
					<p class="f4">Or vice versâ?</p>
			
					<p class="f4">Or to change ripe fruits of action<br />
					into unripe?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or vice versâ?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt221" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg221"><span class="f2">[221]</span></a> Or to make big fruits of action into small?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or vice versâ?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or to cancel them?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or to fabricate them?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By combining your negative answers,<br />
					it comes to this then,<br />
					that the Nigaṇṭhas' <a id="pt222" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg222"><span class="f2">[222]</span></a> efforts and strivings are fruitless.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					ten of whose operative utterances,<br />
					major and minor,<br />
					are to be condemned: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(i) If it is because of their former deeds<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Nigaṇṭhas have a guilty past,<br />
					since they now suffer pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(ii) If it is because of a creator<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Nigaṇṭhas had a bad creator,<br />
					since they now suffer pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iii) If it is because of companionship<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Nigaṇṭhas keep bad company,<br />
					since they now suffer pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iv) If it is because of the particular environment they are born into<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Nigaṇṭhas have found a bad environment,<br />
					since they now suffer pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(v) If it is because of their efforts and strivings here and now<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Nigaṇṭhas' efforts are bad,<br />
					since they now suffer pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(vi) If it is because of their former deeds<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas are blameworthy,<br />
					and they are also blameworthy<br />
					if former deeds are not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(vii) If it is because of a creator<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas are blameworthy,<br />
					and they are also blameworthy<br />
					if a creator is not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(viii) If it is because of companionship<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas are <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> blameworthy,<br />
					and they are also blameworthy<br />
					if the company they keep is not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(ix) If It is because of their birth's environment<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas are blameworthy,<br />
					and they are also blameworthy<br />
					if environment is not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(x) If it is because of their efforts and strivings<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					the Nigaṇṭhas are blameworthy,<br />
					<a id="pt223" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg223"><span class="f2">[223]</span></a> and they are also blameworthy<br />
					if efforts and strivings are not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					ten of whose operative utterances,<br />
					major and minor,<br />
					invite censure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus fruitless are their efforts and strivings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, Almsmen, how do efforts and strivings<br />
					prove fruitful? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who does not defile with Ill<br />
					his undefiled self,<br />
					nor fritter away the bliss<br />
					which the Doctrine gives,<br />
					but keeps it undefiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He comes to know how,<br />
					by wrestling with one constituent of Ill's sources,<br />
					he can induce passionlessness,<br />
					and how he can induce it,<br />
					as regards another constituent,<br />
					by fostering indifference of mind;<br />
					and he proceeds to induce passionlessness<br />
					by the pertinent method accordingly<br />
					and thus Ill becomes outworn and passes away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man who,<br />
					being violently in love with a woman,<br />
					sees her standing about<br />
					and chatting<br />
					and laughing<br />
					and talking with another man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would the sight pain him<br />
					and make him miserable?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sir:<br />
					because he is so violently in love with her<br />
					that he <a id="pt224" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg224"><span class="f2">[224]</span></a> would be very much pained at the sight.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose now this man were to reflect<br />
					that, being violently in love with the woman,<br />
					he had been much distressed<br />
					by seeing her with another man,<br />
					and that consequently he would do well<br />
					to rid himself of his love for her.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose he does so<br />
					and later on sees her laughing<br />
					and talking<br />
					with another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would the sight still pain him<br />
					and make him miserable?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					because he has lost all his old passion for her<br />
					and therefore does not mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg129"><span class="f2 g"><b>[129]</b></span></a> It is j'ust the same with the Almsman<br />
					who does not defile with Ill<br />
					his undefiled self,<br />
					nor fritter away the bliss<br />
					which the Doctrine gives,<br />
					but keeps it undefiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He comes to know how,<br />
					by wrestling with one constituent of Ill's sources,<br />
					he can induce passionlessness,<br />
					and how he can induce it,<br />
					as regards another constituent,<br />
					by fostering indifference of mind;<br />
					and he proceeds to induce passionlessness<br />
					by the pertinent method accordingly<br />
					and thus <a id="pt225" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg225"><span class="f2">[225]</span></a> Ill becomes outworn and passes away.-</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And this is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Almsman reflects that,<br />
					if he leads a careless pleasant life,<br />
					wrong dispositions wax apace within him<br />
					while right dispositions wane;<br />
					and concludes to wrestle with his Ill,<br />
					with the result that wrong dispositions now wane<br />
					while right dispositions wax apace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Henceforth he wrestles no more, -<br />
					because his wrestling has been crowned with entire success.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is like a fletcher<br />
					who heats a shaft amain with two brands<br />
					till he has got it straight and serviceable,<br />
					but stops doing so when his purpose is served,<br />
					simply because it is served.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the Almsman who wrestles down<br />
					the Ill which besets him,<br />
					wrestles no more,<br />
					when, and because, his wrestling<br />
					has been <a id="pt226" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg226"><span class="f2">[226]</span></a> crowned with entire success. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Again, Almsmen, into this world there comes a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself,<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches his Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of other birth,<br />
					who hearing it<br />
					puts his trust in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and in this trust<br />
					bethinks him that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from the circle of his kinsfolk,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					schooled in the Almsmens precepts<br />
					and way of life,<br />
					he puts from him all killing<br />
					and abstains from killing anything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					he lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft he puts from him and eschews;<br />
					taking only what is given to him by others,<br />
					and waiting till it is given,<br />
					he lives an honest and clean life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					all that does not belong to the higher life,<br />
					he leads the higher life in virtue,<br />
					abstaining from low sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					and abstaining from all lying,<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					cleaves to the truth,<br />
					and is staunch and leal,<br />
					never deceiving the world with his lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calumny he puts from him and eschews,<br />
					not repeating elsewhere<br />
					to the harm of people here<br />
					what he hears there,<br />
					nor repeating here<br />
					to the harm of people elsewhere<br />
					what he hears elsewhere;<br />
					thus he heals divisions<br />
					and cements friendship,<br />
					seeking peace<br />
					and ensuing it;<br />
					for in peace is his delight<br />
					and his words are ever the words of a peacemaker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling he puts from him,<br />
					and abstains from reviling people;<br />
					his words are without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					going home to the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tattle he puts from him<br />
					and abstains therefrom,<br />
					he speaks, in season<br />
					and according to the facts,<br />
					words of help<br />
					concerning the Doctrine<br />
					and the Rule,<br />
					words to be stored in the heart,<br />
					words duly illustrated,<br />
					fraught with purpose,<br />
					and pithy.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sedulously avoids hurting the seeds<br />
					or plants of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					never eating at night<br />
					or after hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from looking on at shows of dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews all use and employment<br />
					of smart garlands,<br />
					scents<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sleeps on no tall or broad beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses to accept gold<br />
					or coins of silver, -<br />
					uncooked grain or meat, -<br />
					women or girls, -<br />
					bondwomen or bondmen, -<br />
					sheep or goats, -<br />
					fowls or swine, -<br />
					elephants or cattle or horses or mares, -<br />
					fields or land.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from the practice<br />
					of sending or going on messages.</p>

					<p class="f4">He neither buys nor sells.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never cheats with weights,<br />
					coins,<br />
					or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes no part in bribery,<br />
					cozening,<br />
					cheating,<br />
					or other crooked ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never joins in wounding,<br />
					murdering,<br />
					and manacling,<br />
					or in highway robbery,<br />
					brigandage,<br />
					and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contented is he<br />
					with whatever robes are given him<br />
					as clothing,<br />
					and with whatever alms are given<br />
					for his belly's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a winged bird,<br />
					wheresoever it goes,<br />
					carries with it its feathers and all, -<br />
					so, wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					he enjoys unsullied well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with his eye<br />
					he sees a visible shape,<br />
					he is not absorbed by either its general appearance<br />
					or its details;<br />
					but, since the eye uncontrolled<br />
					might lead to covetousness and discontent,<br />
					to evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					he schools himself to control it,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to establish control.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he does the like<br />
					with his five other faculties of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble control over his faculties,<br />
					he enjoys unalloyed well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purposeful is he in all his doings, -<br />
					whether in coming in or going out,<br />
					in looking ahead or around,<br />
					in stretching out his arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing his clothes<br />
					or carrying his bowl,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring food,<br />
					in attending to the calls of nature,<br />
					in walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speech or in silence; -<br />
					he is always purposeful in all he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					a master of this noble code of control of his faculties of sense,<br />
					and a master of noble mindfulness and purpose in all he does,<br />
					he resorts to a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					when he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					with his heart set on mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His life is purged<br />
					(i.) of appetite for things of the world,<br />
					for he has put from him<br />
					all appetite therefor; -<br />
					(ii.) of all spiteful thoughts,<br />
					for he is filled only with loving-kindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives; -<br />
					(iii.) of all torpor,<br />
					for all torpor has left him,<br />
					driven out by clarity of vision,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by purpose in all he does; -<br />
					(iv.) of ail flurry and worry,<br />
					for he is serene,<br />
					and his heart within is at peace<br />
					and quit of all worries; - and<br />
					(v.) of all doubts,<br />
					for his life is unclouded by doubt,<br />
					he is troubled by no questionings,<br />
					right states of mind<br />
					have purged his heart of all doubting.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he has put from him these five Hindrances<br />
					and has understood how the heart's shortcomings weaken it,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of the senses<br />
					and divested of wrong dispositions,<br />
					he develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness,<br />
					not divorced from observation and reflection. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in my frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it is thus that he applies his heart to the knowledge which recalled his earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration:</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />
					I remembered,<br />
					such and such was my name,<br />
					my sept,<br />
					my class,<br />
					my diet,<br />
					my joys and sorrows,<br />
					and my term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed thence,<br />
					I came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was my name and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I passed to my life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he call to mind his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					he sees them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance <a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> in states of bliss in heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This too is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt227" href="../../pali/mn/mn.101.pali.bd.htm#pg227"><span class="f2">[227]</span></a> That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					I11,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					what the Cankers are,<br />
					with their origin,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this<br />
					his heart is released from the Canker of lusts,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus Delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is now no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what I have been. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, to, is how efforts and strivings prove fruitful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Truth-finder,<br />
					ten of whose intrinsic attributes are to be extolled: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(i) If it is because of their former deeds<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Truth-finder has a blameless past,<br />
					since his present feelings are pleasant<br />
					and freed from all Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(ii) If it is because of a creator<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Truth-finder had a good creator,<br />

					and freed from all Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iii) If it is because of companionship<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Truth-finder keeps good company,<br />

					and freed from all Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iv) If it is because of the particular environment they have been born into<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Truth-finder has found a good environment,<br />

					and freed from all Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(v) If it is because of efforts and strivings here and now<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					clearly the Truth-finder's efforts and strivings have been good,<br />

					and freed from all Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a> (vi) If it is because of their former deeds<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					praise is the due of the Truth-finder;<br />
					as praise is also his due<br />
					if former deeds are not the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(vii) If it is because of a creator<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					praise is the due of the Truth-finder;<br />

					<p class="f4">(viii) If it is because of companionship<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />

					<p class="f4">(ix) If it is because of their birth's environment<br />
					that creatures experience pleasure and pain,<br />
					praise is the due of the Truth-finder;<br />

					<p class="f4">(x) If it is because of their efforts and strivings<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the doctrine of the Truth-finder,<br />
