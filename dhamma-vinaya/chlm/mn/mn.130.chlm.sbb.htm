					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Lord addressed the Almsmen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if there were two houses with doors,<br />
					and a man with eyes to see<br />
					were to stand between them<br />
					and see men going in and out<br />
					and passing to and fro,<br />
					- just in the same way<br />
					do I see, with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					creatures in act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					creatures lowly or debonair,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					happy or unhappy;<br />
					and I am aware that they fare<br />
					according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are creatures given to good<br />
					in act word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble Ones,<br />
					who had a right outlook<br />
					and became what results from such a right outlook; -<br />
					these at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					appear either in states of bliss in heaven<br />
					<a id="pt179" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg179"><span class="f2">[179]</span></a> or as human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again are creatures given to evil<br />
					in act word and thought,<br />
					who decry the Noble Ones,<br />
					have a wrong outlook<br />
					and become what results from such a wrong outlook; -<br />
					<a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> these at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					appear either as ghosts<br />
					or as animals<br />
					or in the misery and woe of purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him do the wardens of purgatory<br />
					haul by the arms before King Yama, saying -</p>

					<p class="f4">This man, sire,<br />
					lacked filial and religious piety<br />
					and flouted his clan elders;<br />
					appoint him his punishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him does King Yama examine<br />
					and question<br />
					and press<br />
					regarding the first messenger of the gods,<br />
					asking the man whether in his human life<br />
					he did not see that messenger appearing.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the man's saying he had not seen him,<br />
					Yama says: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My man, did you never in your human life<br />
					see a tiny new-born babe<br />
					that can only lie on its back in its own filth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you never,<br />
					being a man of intelligence and years,<br />
					bethink you<br />
					that you too were,<br />
					and still continued to be,<br />
					subject to birth,<br />
					and that you should conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">I could not have done it;<br />
					I could not muster up the resolution to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through lack of resolution, my man,<br />
					you have failed to conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, my man;<br />
					they will deal with you<br />
					according to your lack of resolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your misdeeds were not committed<br />
					by your parents,<br />
					<a id="pt180" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> or by your brothers and sisters,<br />
					or by your friends or kinsfolk,<br />
					or by recluses and brahmins,<br />
					or by the gods;<br />
					they were committed by none but yourself;<br />
					and it is you yourself<br />
					who will reap the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing now to the second messenger of the gods,<br />
					Yama questions the man<br />
					as to his having seen this second messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the man's replying<br />
					that he had not seen him,<br />
					Yama says: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My man, did you never in your life on earth<br />
					see an old woman or man<br />
					of eighty<br />
					or ninety<br />
					or a hundred, -<br />
					bent double<br />
					and propping their bowed frames with a staff<br />
					as they totter along,<br />
					decrepid,<br />
					with youth gone,<br />
					with teeth gone,<br />
					with hair grey<br />
					or scanty<br />
					or none left,<br />
					all wrinkled and blotchy?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> Yes, sir; I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you never,<br />
					being a man of intelligence and years,<br />
					bethink you that you too were,<br />
					and still continued to be,<br />
					subject to old-age,<br />
					and that you should conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">I could not have done it ... reap the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing now to the third messenger of the gods,<br />
					Yama questions <a id="pt181" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> the man<br />
					as to his having seen this third messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the man's replying<br />
					that he had not seen him,<br />
					Yama says: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My man, did you never in your human life<br />
					see a woman or a man<br />
					ill and in pain,<br />
					very ill indeed,<br />
					lying in their own excreta,<br />
					needing others to lift them up<br />
					and lay them down?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you never,<br />
					being a man of intelligence and years,<br />
					bethink you that you too were,<br />
					and still continued to be,<br />
					subject to disease,<br />
					and that you should conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">I could not have done it ... reap the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing now to the fourth messenger of the gods,<br />
					Yama questions the man<br />
					as to his having seen the fourth messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the man's replying that he had not seen him,<br />
					Yama says: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My man, did you never in your human life<br />
					see how, when a guilty robber is arrested,<br />
					he is punished by the authorities in divers ways, -<br />
					by flogging ... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.013.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 13</a>)</i> ...<br />
					are impaled alive<br />
					or are beheaded?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you never,<br />
					being a man of intelligence and years,<br />
					bethink you that,<br />
					according to report,<br />
					all evildoers are thus punished in divers ways,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					and why not <a id="pt182" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg182"><span class="f2">[182]</span></a> hereafter? -<br />
					and accordingly conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">I could not nave done it ... reap the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing next to the fifth messenger of the gods,<br />
					Yama questions the man as to his having seen the fifth messenger.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the man's replying that he had not <a id="pg258"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span></a> seen him,<br />
					Yama says: -</p>

					<p class="f4">My man, did you never in your human life<br />
					see the corpse of a woman or of a man<br />
					bloated and blackened and festering?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you never,<br />
					being a man of intelligence and years,<br />
					bethink you that you too were,<br />
					and still continued to be,<br />
					subject to death,<br />
					and that you should conduct yourself aright<br />
					in act word and deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">I could not have done it ... reap the fruits thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having examined,<br />
					questioned<br />
					and pressed the man<br />
					regarding the fifth messenger of the gods,<br />
					King Yama says no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him do the wardens of purgatory<br />
					subject to the fivefold trussing, -<br />
					<a id="pt188" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a> they drive a red-hot peg through each hand and each foot,<br />
					and a fifth through his chest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute pain is his,<br />
					but death comes not to him<br />
					before he has worked off all his evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is pegged down those wardens trim him with axes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, sparing only his head and feet,<br />
					they trim him with razors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they harness him to a chariot<br />
					and drive him to and fro<br />
					over a fiery expanse,<br />
					all aflame and ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those wardens make him climb up and down<br />
					a huge mountain of red-hot embers,<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next they plunge him head over heels<br />
					into the glowing Cauldron of Brass,<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze,<br />
					where he is boiled in the seething foam, -<br />
					whirled now up now down,<br />
					now to this side now to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wardens cast him into Great Purgatory,<br />
					which is -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">four-square, four-doored, a realm quadrangular,<br />
							walled all around with steel and roofed with steel,<br />
							with incandescent floor of molten steel;<br />
							a hundred leagues this way and that its range extends.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg259"><span class="f2 g"><b>[259]</b></span></a> In Great Purgatory, Almsmen,<br />
					the flames that leap up by the eastern wall<br />
					surge right across to dash against the western wall;<br />
					the flames that leap up by the western wall<br />
					surge across to dash against the eastern wall;<br />
					<a id="pt184" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg184"><span class="f2">[184]</span></a> the flames that dart up by the northern wall<br />
					surge across to dash against the southern wall;<br />
					the flames that dart up by the southern wall<br />
					surge across to dash against the northern wall;<br />
					the flames that dart up below<br />
					surge right up against the top;<br />
					and the flames that dart from the top<br />
					surge right down against the bottom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">A time comes - long, long after,<br />
					at the close of a vast period -<br />
					when Great Purgatory's eastern door opens;<br />
					and towards it nimbly and swiftly he runs, -<br />
					burning in skin and hide,<br />
					burning in his flesh,<br />
					burning in his tendons,<br />
					with his bones charring within him;<br />
					such is his plight.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is well on his way to escape,<br />
					the door shuts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the like happens<br />
					when in the fullness of time<br />
					the western<br />
					and the northern<br />
					and the southern doors open in turn<br />
					and close again.</p>

					<p class="f4">A time comes - long, long after,<br />
					at the close of a vast period -<br />
					when once again Great Purgatory's eastern door opens;<br />
					and towards it ... such is his plight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Forth by that door he goes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right alongside of Great Purgatory<br />
					is <a id="pt185" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg185"><span class="f2">[185]</span></a> the great Filth-Purgatory,<br />
					and into that he plumps.</p>

					<p class="f4">In Filth-Purgatory<br />
					needle-mouthed creatures<br />
					successively rip away his skin<br />
					and hide,<br />
					his flesh,<br />
					his tendons,<br />
					and his bones,<br />
					till they can devour his marrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right alongside of Filth-Purgatory<br />
					is the great Ember-Purgatory,<br />
					and into that ne plumps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right alongside of Ember-Purgatory<br />
					is the great Forest of Silk-cotton Trees<br />
					towering a league high<br />
					with prickles half a yard long<br />
					(on its carpet of fallen leaves),<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze;<br />
					and in this forest<br />
					they make him climb up and down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg260"><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></a> Right alongside of that forest<br />
					is the great Sword-leaved forest,<br />
					the leaves of which<br />
					under stress of the wind<br />
					cut off his hands<br />
					and feet<br />
					and ears<br />
					and nose<br />
					and nostrils.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right alongside of this forest<br />
					is the great Caustic River,<br />
					and into that he plumps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now up, now down the stream he is borne,<br />
					and now up and down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Landing him with a fish-hook,<br />
					the wardens of purgatory <a id="pt186" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg186"><span class="f2">[186]</span></a> ask him what he wants;<br />
					and he says he is hungry.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prising his mouth open<br />
					with a red-hot crowbar<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze,<br />
					the wardens of purgatory<br />
					thrust into his mouth<br />
					a red-hot ball of copper<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze,<br />
					which burns his lips,<br />
					mouth,<br />
					throat<br />
					and chest,<br />
					and passes out below,<br />
					carrying with it<br />
					his bowels and intestines.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again the wardens ask him<br />
					what he wants;<br />
					and he says he is thirsty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prising his mouth open as before,<br />
					they pour into bis mouth<br />
					molten copper and bronze<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze,<br />
					which burns his lips,<br />
					mouth,<br />
					throat<br />
					and chest,<br />
					and passes out below,<br />
					carrying with it<br />
					his bowels and intestines.</p>

					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the wardens of purgatory<br />
					cast him once more into Great Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Time was Almsmen,<br />
					when this thought came to King Yama: -</p>

					<p class="f4">They that are reported to do evil in the world<br />
					are punished in these divers ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that I might become a human being<br />
					and that there might then arise in the world a Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					to whom I might attach myself<br />
					to hear the Lord preach his Doctrine<br />
					and myself to understand the Lord's Doctrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">What I am telling you, Almsmen,<br />
					I have heard from no other lips<br />
					whether of recluse or of brahmin;<br />
					I tell you only what I have<br />
					for and by myself<br />
					known and seen and discerned.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt187" href="../../pali/mn/mn.130.pali.bd.htm#pg187"><span class="f2">[187]</span></a>	Thus spoke the Lord;<br />
					and the Blessed One went on to add the following: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg261"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span></a> If vainly warn'd by heaven's messengers,<br />
							young brahmins careless live, long time their sloth<br />
							they'll rue, in lowly shapes condemtied to live.<br />
							But they, the good, who warning take betimes<br />
							and, sloth eschewing, grasp the Doctrine true,<br />
							- these from Attachment's perils find Release,<br />
							in final triumph over birth and death.<br />
							At peace, and blissful, here and now they find<br />
							Nirvāna, purged of hatred, purged of fear,<br />
							o'er Ill triumphant.</p>
