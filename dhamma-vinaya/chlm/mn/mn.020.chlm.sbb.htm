					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Lord addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman who applies himself to the higher thought<br />
					should pass in review from time to time<br />
					five phases of mind;<br />
					and these are they:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i.) When, by reason of a phase of mind,<br />
					there arise in a Brother<br />
					bad and wrong thoughts associated with appetite,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					then he should divert his mind from that<br />
					to another phase<br />
					associated with what is right;<br />
					and, by his doing so,<br />
					those bad and wrong thoughts<br />
					pass away and disappear,<br />
					so that his heart stands firm,<br />
					is stedfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a skilled artizan<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					will with a little peg<br />
					knock and drive out and expel a big peg,<br />
					so, when, by reason of a phase of mind,<br />
					there arise in an Almsman<br />
					bad and wrong thoughts ...<br />
					focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii.) If, though the Almsman diverts his mind<br />
					from the former to the latter phase,<br />
					there still arise in him<br />
					the same bad and wrong thoughts as before,<br />
					then he should study the perils these entail,<br />
					marking how wrong and depraved such thoughts are<br />
					and how they ripen unto Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he studies them,<br />
					these bad and wrong thoughts<br />
					pass away and disappear,<br />
					so that his heart stands firm,<br />
					is stedfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a woman or man or dressy lad,<br />
					if the carcase of snake<br />
					or dog<br />
					or human being<br />
					be slung round their necks,<br />
					are filled with horror,<br />
					loathing<br />
					and disgust, -<br />
					even so is it with this Almsman<br />
					in his scrutiny.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii.) If, for all his scrutiny of their perils,<br />
					these bad and wrong thoughts<br />
					still keep on arising,<br />
					then he should ignore them<br />
					and not let his mind dwell on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he ignores them,<br />
					they will pass away and disappear,<br />
					so that his heart stands firm,<br />
					is steadfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man with eyes to see,<br />
					will, if he does not want to view<br />
					visible forms that come within his field of vision,<br />
					close his eyes<br />
					or look another wray, -<br />
					even so is it with the Almsman<br />
					in his ignoring of bad and wrong thoughts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv.) If, for all his ignoring of them,<br />
					these bad and wrong thoughts<br />
					still keep on arising,<br />
					then he must <a id="pg84"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></a> bethink him<br />
					how to allay<br />
					all that moulds and fashions thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he does so,<br />
					these thoughts will pass away and disappear,<br />
					so that his heart stands firm,<br />
					is stedfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man who is running fast,<br />
					may decide to walk slowly -<br />
					or stand still -<br />
					or sit down -<br />
					or lie down -<br />
					and thereby passes from the more violent<br />
					to the easier posture, -<br />
					even so is it with this Almsman<br />
					in his allaying of all that moulds and fashions thoughts.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(v.) But, if, allay as he may,<br />
					these thoughts continue to arise,<br />
					then, with his teeth clenched<br />
					and with his tongue pressed against his palate,<br />
					he should, by sheer force of mind,<br />
					restrain,<br />
					coerce<br />
					and dominate his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he does so,<br />
					these thoughts will pass away and disappear,<br />
					so that his heart stands firm,<br />
					is stedfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man,<br />
					taking a weaker man by the head or shoulders,<br />
					restrains<br />
					and coerces<br />
					and dominates him, -<br />
					even so, if, allay as he may, these thoughts ...<br />
					focussed<br />
					and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When at last, whether<br />
					(i.) by diverting his mind elsewhere or<br />
					(ii.) by scrutiny of the perilous consequences or<br />
					(iii.) by ignoring bad and wrong thoughts or<br />
					(iv.) by allaying what moulds them or<br />
					(v.) by subduing them,<br />
					the Almsman is victorious over bad and wrong thoughts<br />
					associated with appetite,<br />
					hatred<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					so that they pass away and disappear<br />
					and his heart stands firm<br />
					and is stedfast,<br />
					is focussed<br />
					and concentrated, -<br />
					then indeed has he earned the style<br />
					of master of the ordering of his thoughts,<br />
					for, he will think only such thoughts as he wishes<br />
					and not those he wishes not to think;<br />
					he has hewn away cravings,<br />
					has shed his fetters,<br />
					and - by fathoming propensities to pride -<br />
					has made an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
