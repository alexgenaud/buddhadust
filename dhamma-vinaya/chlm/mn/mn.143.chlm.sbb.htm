					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the householder Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					being ill and in pain and in grave danger,<br />
					sent a man <a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> to go in his name to the Lord<br />
					and, bowing his head at the Lord's feet,<br />
					to say how ill he was<br />
					and how be bowed his head at the feet of the Lord;<br />
					and further to carry the same message<br />
					to the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					with the added request to the latter<br />
					to be so good as to come to the house.</p>

					<p class="f4">The two messages having been duly delivered,<br />
					Sāriputta -<br />
					with Ānanda in attendance -<br />
					came to Anāthapiṇḍika's house<br />
					and, <a id="pt259" href="../../pali/mn/mn.143.pali.bd.htm#pg259"><span class="f2">[259]</span></a> seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					asked the householder whether he was getting better<br />
					and able to hold on,<br />
					whether his pains were leaving him<br />
					and not coming on,<br />
					and whether he found himself progressing<br />
					and not losing ground with his pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not at all, Sāriputta;<br />
					I am not getting better<br />
					but worse;<br />
					... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.097.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 97</a>)</i> ...<br />
					I am losing ground;<br />
					my pains grow on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must, therefore, train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of sight<br />
					nor ever to let your consciousness hang on sight, -<br />
					or hearing -<br />
					or smell -<br />
					or taste -<br />
					or touch -<br />
					or mind,<br />
					or upon form<br />
					and the other objects of these six senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of consciousness<br />
					nor of any particular mode of consciousness,<br />
					whether ocular,<br />
					or auditory,<br />
					or olfactory,<br />
					or gustatory,<br />
					or tactile<br />
					or mental.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of ocular Contact<br />
					or of the other five Contacts,<br />
					<a id="pt260" href="../../pali/mn/mn.143.pali.bd.htm#pg260"><span class="f2">[260]</span></a> or of feelings bred of such Contacts.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of the earth element<br />
					or of the water-element<br />
					or of the fire-element<br />
					or of the wind-element<br />
					or of the space-element<br />
					or of the consciousness-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of form<br />
					or any consciousness of form, -<br />
					or of feeling -<br />
					or of perception -<br />
					or of the plastic forces -<br />
					or of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of the Realm of Infinite Space -<br />
					or of the Realm of Naught -<br />
					<a id="pt261" href="../../pali/mn/mn.143.pali.bd.htm#pg261"><span class="f2">[261]</span></a> or of the Realm of Neither-perception-nor-Non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of this world<br />
					or of any other world.</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourself<br />
					not to be the creature of,<br />
					or to let your consciousness hang on,<br />
					any- <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> thing seen,<br />
					heard,<br />
					thought,<br />
					cognized,<br />
					sought or explored by the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">As Sāriputta ended,<br />
					the householder Anāthapiṇḍika cried aloud and shed tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him the reverend Ānanda said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you in the toils, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you sinking?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not at all, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I have long been round the Master<br />
					and Almsmen of great intellect,<br />
					never yet heard I such a homily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such homilies, householder,<br />
					are not vouchsafed to the white-robed laity,<br />
					but reserved for Pilgrims.</p>

					<p class="f4">But let them be vouchsafed to the laity,<br />
					reverend Sāriputta; -<br />
					young men there are<br />
					whose vision is but little dimmed,<br />
					who are perishing because they do not hear the Doctrine,<br />
					and these will understand it.</p>

					<p class="f4">The exhortation over,<br />
					Sāriputta and Ānanda rose up and departed;<br />
					nor had they been gone long<br />
					when the householder Anāthapiṇḍika, <a id="pt262" href="../../pali/mn/mn.143.pali.bd.htm#pg262"><span class="f2">[262]</span></a> at his body's dissolution after death,<br />
					passed to the Tusita heavens.</p>

					<p class="f4">As night waned,<br />
					the deified Anāthapiṇḍika<br />
					in surpassing beauty<br />
					came to the Lord,<br />
					illumining the whole of Jetas grove.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Aṭṭhāsi. Stood. The gods do not sit when visiting here on earth. To them it would be like sitting in a pile of dung.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Seating himself after salutations,<br />
					the deity addressed the Lord<br />
					in the following verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Dear grove of Jeta, haunt of sages, home<br />
							of Truth's sole monarch! Bliss to thee I owe.<br />
							Here toil wins knowledge and Truths mysteries;<br />
							here virtue still inspires the highest life<br />
							and hallows mortals not by rank or wealth.<br />
							Alive to their true welfare, let the wise<br />
							still search the Doctrine till they hallowed are.<br />
							Oh, Sāriputtta's wisdom, virtue, peace!<br />
							- No Sainted Almsman can yet higher go.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the deified Anāthapiṇḍika,<br />
					and the Master approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Marking the approval of the Master,<br />
					the deity saluted the Lord with deep reverence<br />
					and vanished away.</p>

					<p class="f4">When night was passed the Lord narrated to the Almsmen<br />
					how he had been visited by a deity<br />
					and detailed all that had passed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt268" href="../../pali/mn/mn.143.pali.bd.htm#pg268"><span class="f2">[268]</span></a> Thereupon the <a id="pg305"><span class="f2 g"><b>[305]</b></span></a> reverend Ānanda said to the Lord<br />
					that this deity must have been Anāthapiṇḍika, the householder,<br />
					who had such perfect trust in the reverend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that inference can bestow, is yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">The deity was indeed no other than Anāthapiṇḍika.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
