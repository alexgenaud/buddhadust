					<p class="f4"><i>At one time the Lord was staying near <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a><br />

					<p class="f4"><i>Then the brahman youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<br />

					<p class="f4">First, they rank truth,<br />

					followed next by study<br />

					<p class="f4">These are the Brahmins' five,<br />

					<p class="f4">Tell me; - is there one single brahmin<br />
					who avers that he has discerned and realized the five<br />
					so that he can affirm their outcome?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there one single teacher,<br />
					or teacher of teachers,<br />
					of brahmins for seven generations back<br />
					who can aver it?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">These words mightily angered and incensed the young brahmin,<br />

					<p class="f4">The brahmin Pokkharasāti,<br />

					and to rise to the heights of truly Noble Knowledge,<br />
					their claims <a id="pt201" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg201"><span class="f2">[201]</span></a> prove ridiculous, -<br />

					<p class="f4">Why he cannot do that<br />
					as regards his own maidservant Puṇṇikā,<br />

					of all recluses and brahmins as a body!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />

					who could not see black or white,<br />
					blue or yellow,<br />

					the stars,<br />
					or the sun and moon,<br />
					and who should affirm<br />
					that there were no such things<br />
					and that no one could see them, -<br />
					on the ground forsooth that,<br />
					as he himself had no knowledge or vision of them,<br />
					therefore they were non-existent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In so saying,<br />
					would he say aright?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These things do exist<br />

					flurry and worry,<br />

					which transcends all human bounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Five strands, too,<br />

					visible shapes,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes and touch,<br />

					all of them bound up with passion and lusts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> fivefold pleasures of sense<br />
					the brahmin Pokkharasāti enjoys,<br />
					being enslaved by avid infatuation,<br />
					and neither seeing their danger<br />
					nor understanding how treacherous they all are, -<br />
					so that he can never possibly know or see or realize<br />

					which transcends all human bounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If there be a fire kindled,<br />

					<p class="f4">If it be possible, Gotama,<br />
					to kindle a fire<br />
					without the bracken and wood to feed it,<br />
					the fire would burn up and blaze.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is out of the question and impossible<br />
					to get a fire to blaze up without fuel,<br />
					except by a magician's art.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fire that is kindled with fuel,<br />
					symbolizes the satisfaction which <a id="pt204" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg204"><span class="f2">[204]</span></a> arises<br />
					from pleasures of sense;<br />
					while the fire without fuel<br />
					symbolizes the satisfaction which arises<br />
					when pleasures of sense<br />
					and wrong dispositions<br />
					are not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, what is the nature<br />
					of this latter satisfaction?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong dispositions<br />
					develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy; -<br />
					this is a satisfaction<br />
					wholly remote from pleasures of sense<br />

					<p class="f4">Or, take an Almsman who<br />
					develops and dwells in the Second Ecstasy; -<br />
					this too is a satisfaction<br />
					in which pleasure and wrong dispositions<br />
					find no place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Tell me now;<br />
					which of the five qualities,<br />
					as specified by brahmins<br />
					for the achievement of merit<br />
					and the attainment of what is right,<br />
					do they specify<br />
					as more effectual than the rest?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Munificence, Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose that a brahmin prepares a great sacrifice<br />
					and that two brahmins come to take part,<br />
					of whom the first looks to have the best rice,<br />
					the best seat,<br />
					the best water<br />
					and the best piece of meat,<br />
					in preference to any other brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose, however,<br />
					that, in his stead,<br />
					the second brahmin is preferred,<br />
					<a id="pt205" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg205"><span class="f2">[205]</span></a> to the indignation and mortification of the first brahmin. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What, according to brahmins,<br />
					will be the outcome of the disappointed man?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg118"><span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></a> When brahmins distribute gifts, Gotama,<br />
					they do not do so<br />
					in such a way as to excite indignation and mortification;<br />
					their giving is prompted by compassion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On this showing,<br />
					brahmins have a sixth way of achieving merit,<br />
					namely by compassion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, on this showing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you observe that the brahmins'<br />
					five qualities for achieving merit<br />
					and attaining what is right<br />
					thrive better in men with homes or in Pilgrims?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Best in Pilgrims<br />
					and but little in men with houses and homes, Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For such a man's life is so full and busy<br />
					with questions to solve<br />
					and difficulties to overcome,<br />
					that he is not so uniformly and consistently truthful<br />
					as the Pilgrim is<br />
					who is immune from business cares.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same applies<br />
					to the four other qualities too;<br />
					for a man with a home<br />
					is not uniformly and consistently ascetic,<br />
					chaste,<br />
					regular in repeating the mantras,<br />
					and munificent, -<br />
					whereas a Pilgrim is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So, according to my observation,<br />
					these five qualities thrive best in the Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In my view,<br />
					the whole of the five<br />
					do but implement the heart<br />
					<a id="pt206" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg206"><span class="f2">[206]</span></a> to free a man from wrath and malevolence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who professes the Truth<br />
					and, in the assurance thereon,<br />
					takes in import and doctrine<br />
					and the satisfaction which attends the doctrine,<br />
					that satisfaction which attends the right; -<br />
					all this, in my view,<br />
					does but implement the heart<br />
					to raise it to freedom from wrath and malevolence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or, if a like assurance<br />
					of each of the other four qualities within himself<br />
					ensures the same result,<br />
					all this, in my view,<br />
					does but implement the heart<br />
					to free it from wrath and malevolence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The whole of the five qualities<br />
					do but implement the heart so as to free it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point the young brahmin Subha said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have heard that you know<br />
					the way to union with Brahmā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Tell me this.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is Naḷakāra-gāma near here,<br />
					not very far away?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose, now, a man,<br />
					who had been born there,<br />
					<a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> had grown up there<br />
					and had always lived there,<br />
					were asked the way thither, -<br />
					would he be at a loss or perplexed?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Gotama;<br />
					for, having been born and bred there,<br />
					he would have full knowledge of every road to the place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whether the man born and bred in the place<br />
					would be at a loss or perplexed<br />
					by an enquiry concerning the road thither,<br />
					assuredly the Truth-finder would be at no loss<br />
					and in no perplexity<br />
					<a id="pt207" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg207"><span class="f2">[207]</span></a> at a question concerning the heaven of Brahmā<br />
					or the way thither.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For well do I know Brahmā and his heaven<br />
					and the way thither;<br />
					well too do I know<br />
					what path he has trodden<br />
					who is reborn in the heaven of Brahmā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have heard that you teach the way to union with Brahmā;<br />
					and I would ask you to teach me it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then listen and pay attention;<br />
					I will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Subha readily assenting,<br />
					the Lord spoke as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the way to union with Brahmā?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who dwells with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second quarter -<br />
					a third quarter -<br />
					the fourth quarter of the world;<br />
					who dwells with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					- with radiant thought of love<br />
					all-embracing and vast,<br />
					beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hatred or malice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is with such infinite love,<br />
					and with a heart so enfranchised,<br />
					that he transcends the finite<br />
					and neither abides therein<br />
					nor halts there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a mighty conch-blower<br />
					can with ease<br />
					make his blast heard north,<br />
					south,<br />
					east<br />
					and west, -<br />
					so does the Almsman transcend the finite<br />
					and neither abides therein<br />
					nor halts there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is a way to union with Brahmā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as with love,<br />
					so it is also with pity,<br />
					compassion<br />
					and poise;<br />
					<a id="pt208" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg208"><span class="f2">[208]</span></a> all these are ways to union with Brahmā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this close,<br />
					the young brahmin Subha,<br />
					son of Todeyya,<br />
					said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a disciple<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge,<br />
					from this day forth while life shall last.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> And now, Gotama,<br />
					I must be going,<br />
					for I am busy and have much to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At your pleasure,<br />
					answered the Lord,<br />
					from whom,<br />
					with grateful thanks,<br />
					Subha now took his leave,<br />
					with deep reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this time the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī<br />
					was driving out of Sāvatthī at noon<br />
					in a carriage which was all white<br />
					and was drawn by milk-white mares,<br />
					when at a distance he espied Subha returning to that city<br />
					and asked where he was coming from<br />
					so early in the day;<br />
					and was told he had been with the recluse Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is your view of him,<br />
					Bhāradvāja?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Has he got depth of thought?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is he learned,<br />
					do you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt209" href="../../pali/mn/mn.099.pali.bd.htm#pg209"><span class="f2">[209]</span></a>	Who am I to comprehend the depth<br />
					of the reduse Gotama's thought?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Only his peer could do that.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is lofty praise indeed<br />
					that you accord him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who, who am I to praise him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Naught but praise upon praise is his,<br />
					that foremost among gods and men;<br />
					and as for the five qualities<br />
					whicn brahmins specify for the achievement of merit<br />
					and the attainment of the right, -<br />
					why the recluse Gotama says<br />
					they do nothing but implement the heart<br />
					to free it from wrath and malevolence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereon the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī<br />
					alighted from his carriage so white,<br />
					and with right shoulder respectfully bared<br />
					and with folded palms stretched out towards the Lord,<br />
					burst forth with this heartfelt utterance: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How good it is,<br />
					how very good,<br />
					for King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					that in his realm there is dwelling the Truth-finder,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened!</p>
