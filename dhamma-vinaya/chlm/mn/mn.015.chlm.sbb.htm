					<p class="f4">Once when the venerable Mahā-Moggallāna was staying in the Bhagga country<br />
					at Crocodile Peak<br />
					in the Bhesakala wood,<br />
					in the deer-park there,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, despite his invitation to his seniors to teach him<br />
					and despite his professed anxiety to learn,<br />
					an Almsman proves unruly<br />
					and obstreperous in temper,<br />
					fractious and unreceptive of instruction, -<br />
					then his fellows in the higher life<br />
					deem him unfit to be taught<br />
					or instructed<br />
					or trusted.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are the states of mind<br />
					that make a man obstreperous in temper?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who is evilly inclined<br />
					and is the thrall of evil <a id="pg70"><span class="f2 g"><b>[70]</b></span></a> inclinations; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who lauds himself<br />
					and runs down others; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is wrathful<br />
					and the slave of wrath; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is wrathful<br />
					and because of his wrath<br />
					bears grudges; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is wrathful<br />
					and because of his wrath<br />
					takes offence; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is wrathful<br />
					and because of his wrath<br />
					utters words of unbridled wrath; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who, being reproved,<br />
					argues with his reprover; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who, being reproved,<br />
					resents the reproof; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who, being reproved,<br />
					retorts with charges against his reprover; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who, being reproved,<br />
					wraps one thing up in another,<br />
					turns the talk off to something irrelevant,<br />
					displaying ill-temper,<br />
					malice,<br />
					and distrust; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who, being reproved,<br />
					fails to explain his proceedings; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is a hypocrite<br />
					and impostor; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who harbours envy and jealousy; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is full of guile and deceit; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who is stubborn and arrogant; -</p>

					<p class="f4">or who hugs the temporal,<br />
					nor looses his grip and hold thereon; -</p>

					<p class="f4">all these are states of mind<br />
					that make a man obstreperous in temper.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">But if an Almsman who invites his seniors to teach him<br />
					and professes anxiety to learn,<br />
					proves humble and meek,<br />
					docile and receptive, -<br />
					then his fellows in the higher life<br />
					deem him fit to be taught<br />
					and instructed<br />
					and trusted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what are the states of mind<br />
					that make for meekness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen, they are<br />
					[point for point the precise opposites of the foregoing list].</p>

					<p class="f4">In connection with the foregoing states of mind,<br />
					an Almsman ought to argue about himself as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">The man of evil inclinations<br />
					is displeasing and disagreeable to me;<br />
					and if I incline to evil,<br />
					others will regard me likewise<br />
					as displeasing and disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing this,<br />
					he must school his heart<br />
					never to give way to evil inclinations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, realizing that,<br />
					just as he dislikes each of the other shortcomings in others,<br />
					so their presence in himself<br />
					will make him disliked likewise,<br />
					the Almsman must school his heart<br />
					never to give way to any single one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">He ought to reflect within himself<br />
					whether he is evilly inclined<br />
					and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this reflection tells him<br />
					that he has got evil inclinations<br />
					and <a id="pg71"><span class="f2 g"><b>[71]</b></span></a> so forth,<br />
					then he must strive to get rid of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if reflection tells him<br />
					he has not got evil inclinations<br />
					or the other evil states of mind,<br />
					then let his life be filled with zest and holy joy<br />
					as he trains himself<br />
					by day and by night<br />
					in right states of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If his reflection tells him<br />
					that each and every one of these evil and wrong states of mind<br />
					persists within him,<br />
					he must strive to get rid of them all.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if reflection tells him<br />
					he has got rid of them all,<br />
					then let his life be filled with zest and holy joy<br />
					as he trains himself<br />
					by day and by night<br />
					in right states of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sirs, it is just like a woman or man<br />
					or lad young and dressy,<br />
					to whom the reflection of their features<br />
					in a bright clean mirror<br />
					or in a bowl of clear water<br />
					reveals a smut or pimple,<br />
					so that they strive to get rid of it;<br />
					but if the reflection revealed nothing of the kind,<br />
					they rejoice that all is right<br />
					and that their faces are clean and clear; -<br />
					even so is it with an Almsman;<br />
					if reflection tells him<br />
					that these evil and wrong states of mind<br />
					persist within him,<br />
					he must strive to get rid of them all;<br />
					but if he is conscious of having got rid of all of them,<br />
					then let his life be filled with zest and holy joy<br />
					as he trains himself<br />
					by day and by night<br />
					in right states of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what he had said.</p>
