					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					rising from his meditations at eventide,<br />
					came to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there,<br />
					the Lord said to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Your faculties, Sāriputta, are acute;<br />
					<a id="pt294" href="../../pali/mn/mn.151.pali.bd.htm#pg294"><span class="f2">[294]</span></a> and your complexion is clear and unsullied.</p>

					<p class="f4">What manner of life do you mostly live nowadays?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mostly aloof nowadays, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Sāriputta, quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yours is indeed the Superman's life,<br />
					for his is a life aloof.</p>

					<p class="f4">If an Almsman desires to live mostly aloof,<br />
					he should ask himself whether,<br />
					on the way he took to the village for alms<br />
					or in the district he frequented for alms<br />
					or on the way he came back from his round for alms,<br />
					he there found that the sense-objects of sight -<br />
					or of hearing<br />
					or of the other senses -<br />
					had aroused longings<br />
					or lust<br />
					or hate<br />
					or folly<br />
					or repugnance of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on the one hand,<br />
					he finds that they had aroused such emotions,<br />
					then he must strive to get rid of<br />
					those bad and wrong dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he finds that nothing of the sort had been aroused,<br />
					then he should dwell on in this selfsame joy and bliss,<br />
					day and night immersed in studious aspiration for right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt295" href="../../pali/mn/mn.151.pali.bd.htm#pg295"><span class="f2">[295]</span></a>	If, on questioning himself similarly<br />
					about the five pleasures of the senses,<br />
					he finds they are not got rid of from his heart,<br />
					he must strive to get rid of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he finds that he is rid of them,<br />
					he should dwell on in this self-same joy and bliss,<br />
					day and night immersed in studious aspiration for right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on questioning himself similarly<br />
					about the five hindrances,<br />
					he finds ... right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on questioning himseTf similarly about the five <a id="pg324"><span class="f2 g"><b>[324]</b></span></a> factors of attachment,<br />
					he finds that he has not fathomed them,<br />
					he must strive to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he finds that <a id="pt296" href="../../pali/mn/mn.151.pali.bd.htm#pg296"><span class="f2">[296]</span></a> he has done so,<br />
					he should dwell on in this selfsame joy and bliss,<br />
					day and night immersed in studious aspiration for right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on questioning himself similarly<br />
					about the four bases of mindfulness,<br />
					he finds that he has not developed them,<br />
					he must strive to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he finds that he has ... right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the like course should he take with developing<br />
					the four right efforts,<br />
					the five faculties,<br />
					the five forces,<br />
					the seven factors of enlightenment,<br />
					the Noble Eightfold Path,<br />
					<a id="pt297" href="../../pali/mn/mn.151.pali.bd.htm#pg297"><span class="f2">[297]</span></a> and calm and intuition.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on questioning himself similarly<br />
					about realizing Understanding and Deliverance,<br />
					he finds that he has not realized them,<br />
					he must strive to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he finds that he has done so,<br />
					then he should dwell on in this selfsame joy and bliss,<br />
					day and night immersed in studious aspiration for right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Sāriputta,<br />
					all those recluses or brahmins<br />
					who have in the past observed purity in collecting alms,<br />
					have done so by constant review and self-questioning;<br />
					and so too it shall always be in days to come,<br />
					as it is to-day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Sāriputta, you must study by constant review<br />
					to observe purity in collecting alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
