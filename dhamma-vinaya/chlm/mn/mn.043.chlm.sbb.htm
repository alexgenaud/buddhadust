					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/personalities/mahakotthito.htm">Mahā-Koṭṭhita,</a> rising up at eventide from his meditations,<br />
					went to the reverend Sāriputta<br />
					and, after greetings,<br />
					took his seat to one side<br />
					and spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of a man as lacking understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, in what respects does he lack understanding?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he does not understand,<br />
					that he is said to lack understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not understand what Ill is,<br />
					or its origin,<br />
					or its cessation,<br />
					or the way that leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why he is said to lack <a id="pg208"><span class="f2 g"><b>[208]</b></span></a> understanding, -<br />
					because he does not understand these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">With an expression of his grateful thanks to Sāriputta,<br />
					Mahā-Koṭṭhita put this further question:</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of a man as having understanding <i>(paññā)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, in what respects has he got understanding?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he understands,<br />
					that he is said to have got understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands what Ill is,<br />
					and its origin,<br />
					and its cessation,<br />
					and the way that leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is why he is said to have got understanding, -<br />
					because he understands these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of consciousness <i>(viññāṇa).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Why is it so called?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he is conscious,<br />
					that we speak of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is conscious that a thing is pleasant,<br />
					or unpleasant,<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because he is conscious,<br />
					that consciousness is so called.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are understanding and consciousness associated or dissociated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a differentia between the two states be shewn by persistent analysis?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are associated,<br />
					not dissociated;<br />
					a differentia between them cannot be shewn by persistent analysis.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, what a man understands,<br />
					he is conscious of;<br />
					and what he is conscious of,<br />
					he understands.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore these two states are associated,<br />
					not dissociated;<br />
					analysis cannot shew their differentia.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the differentia?</p>

					<p class="f4">In understanding we have to develop;<br />
					in consciousness we have to apprehend; -<br />
					that is what differentiates them.</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of feeling. -<br />
					In what sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">A man feels and therefore it is called feeling, -<br />
					of the pleasant or unpleasant or indifferent.</p>

					<p class="f4">We speak of perception. -<br />
					In what sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">He perceives and therefore it is called perception, -<br />
					of blue,<br />
					or yellow,<br />
					or red,<br />
					or white.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are feeling, perception, and consciousness associated or dissociated?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can a differentia between these states be shewn by persistent analysis?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg209"><span class="f2 g"><b>[209]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">They are associated,<br />
					not dissociated;<br />
					a differentia between them<br />
					cannot be shewn by persistent analysis.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is felt is perceived,<br />
					and there is consciousness of what is perceived;<br />
					consequently these states are associated,<br />
					not dissociated;<br />
					analysis cannot shew their differentia.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is knowable by pure mental consciousness <i>(mano-viññāṇa)</i>,<br />
					isolated from the five faculties of bodily sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">The ideas of Infinity of Space,<br />
					of Infinity of Mind,<br />
					and of the Realm of Naught,<br />
					are knowable by pure mental consciousness,<br />
					isolated from the five faculties of bodily sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">By what are these knowable ideas known?</p>

					<p class="f4">By the eye of understanding <i>(paññā-cakkhu).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">What does understanding promote?</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher and precise knowledges<br />
					and Renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many conditions are required<br />
					to create a right outlook?</p>

					<p class="f4">Two, - instruction imparted,<br />
					and systematized thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many factors help a right outlook to win the fruit,<br />
					and the guerdon of the fruit,<br />
					of Deliverance alike of heart and mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Five, -<br />
					virtue,<br />
					study,<br />
					converse,<br />
					tranquillization,<br />
					and discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many types of re-birth are there?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					sensuous,<br />
					corporeal,<br />
					and incorporeal.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does re-birth come to pass hereafter<br />
					in a subsequent existence?</p>

					<p class="f4">By creatures -<br />
					hampered by ignorance<br />
					and clogged by cravings -<br />
					revelling now in this object,<br />
					now in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does re-birth not come to pass?</p>

					<p class="f4">By the disappearance of the passion that Ignorance brings,<br />
					by the uprising of knowledge,<br />
					and by the cessation of cravings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the First Ecstasy?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of mind,<br />
					an Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides <a id="pg210"><span class="f2 g"><b>[210]</b></span></a> in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection, -<br />
					that is called the First Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many factors are there in it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Five, -<br />
					observation,<br />
					reflection,<br />
					zest,<br />
					satisfaction,<br />
					and a focussed heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many factors has the First Ecstasy put from it,<br />
					and how many does it retain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Five of each.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gone are lusts,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					torpor,<br />
					worry,<br />
					and doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Observation,<br />
					reflection,<br />
					zest,<br />
					satisfaction,<br />
					and a focussed heart persist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the five senses<br />
					of sight,<br />
					sound,<br />
					smell,<br />
					taste,<br />
					and touch, -<br />
					each with its own particular province<br />
					and range of function<br />
					separate and mutually distinct.</p>

					<p class="f4">What ultimate base have they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who enjoys all their five provinces and ranges?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mind <i>(mano).</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On what do these five faculties of sense depend?</p>

					<p class="f4">On vitality.</p>

					<p class="f4">On what does vitality depend?</p>

					<p class="f4">On heat.</p>

					<p class="f4">On what does heat depend?</p>

					<p class="f4">On vitality.</p>

					<p class="f4">You say that vitality depends on heat;<br />
					you say that heat depends on vitality.</p>

					<p class="f4">What precisely is the meaning to be attached to this?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will give you an illustration;<br />
					an illustration oftentimes serves to bring home the meaning of a remark to persons of intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the case of a lighted lamp<br />
					the light reveals the flame<br />
					and the flame the light, -<br />
					so vitality depends on heat<br />
					and heat on vitality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, as to plastic forces of vitality, -<br />
					are they simply objects of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or are they different from them?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are not sensible objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were they sensible,<br />
					then the emergence of an Almsman who had <a id="pg211"><span class="f2 g"><b>[211]</b></span></a> passed into trance without perception and without feeling,<br />
					could never be witnessed;<br />
					it can be witnessed just because the plastic forces of vitality are different from sensible objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many things must quit the body<br />
					before it is flung aside<br />
					and cast away like a senseless log?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					vitality,<br />
					heat,<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the difference between a lifeless corpse<br />
					and an Almsman in trance,<br />
					in whom perception and feeling are stilled?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the corpse<br />
					not only are the plastic forces<br />
					of the body and speech and mind<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					stilled and quiescent<br />
					but also vitality is exhausted,<br />
					heat is quenched,<br />
					and the faculties of sense broken up; -<br />
					whereas in the Almsman in trance<br />
					vitality persists,<br />
					heat abides,<br />
					and the faculties are clear,<br />
					although respiration,<br />
					observation<br />
					and perception<br />
					are stilled and quiescent.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many conditions are needed<br />
					to produce that ecstatic state of the heart's Deliverance<br />
					wherein there is neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction?</p>

					<p class="f4">Four. -<br />
					By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many conditions are needed<br />
					for that ecstatic state of the hearts Deliverance<br />
					which is void of phenomenal relations?</p>

					<p class="f4">Two, -<br />
					(1) Keeping the mind off all that is phenomenal, and<br />
					(2) fixing it on what is not phenomenal.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many conditions make this Deliverance persist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					(1) Keeping the mind off all that is phenomenal,<br />
					(2) fixing it on what is not phenomenal, and<br />
					(3) precedent preparation.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many conditions are needed<br />
					for emerging from this Deliverance?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg212"><span class="f2 g"><b>[212]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">Two, -<br />
					(1) fixing the mind on the phenomenal and<br />
					(2) keeping the mind off the non-phenomenal.</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching those Deliverances of the heart<br />
					which are boundless <i>(appamāṇa),</i><br />
					Naught <i>(ākiñcañña),</i><br />
					emptied <i>(suññata),</i><br />
					and non-phenomenal <i>(animitta),</i> -<br />
					do all these states of consciousness<br />
					differ both in connotation and in denotation,<br />
					or are they identical in connotation<br />
					while differing in denotation?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one sense their connotation is different,<br />
					in another sense identical.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what sense do these four states of consciousness<br />
					differ in connotation<br />
					as well as in denotation?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is called boundless Deliverance of heart<br />
					when an Almsman dwells with radiant good-will<br />
					pervading first one quarter of the world -<br />
					then the second -<br />
					then the third -<br />
					and then the fourth quarter;<br />
					when he dwells with radiant good-will<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					and everywhere,<br />
					with radiant good-will<br />
					all-embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					wherein no hate or malice finds a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with good-will,<br />
					so, in turn, with radiant compassion,<br />
					and sympathy,<br />
					and poised equanimity<br />
					does he pervade the whole length and breadth of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is called Naught Deliverance when,<br />
					wholly transcending the realm of consciousness,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Realm of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is called emptied Deliverance when,<br />
					in the wilds<br />
					or under a tree<br />
					or in an empty dwelling,<br />
					he reflects that Emptiness is here, -<br />
					no Self<br />
					nor anything appertaining to a Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is called non-phenomenal Deliverance<br />
					when by keeping his mind off all that is phenomenal,<br />
					an Almsman enters on,<br />
					and dwells in,<br />
					the serenity of heart<br />
					which is beyond the phenomenal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The foregoing is the sense<br />
					in which both the connotation<br />
					and the denotation<br />
					of these several Deliverances<br />
					differ from one another.</p>

					<p class="f4">In what sense, now,<br />
					is their connotation identical<br />
					while their denotation differs?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is passion,<br />
					it is malevolence,<br />
					it is illusion,<br />
					which <a id="pg213"><span class="f2 g"><b>[213]</b></span></a> impose bounds;<br />
					in the Arahat who has extirpated the Cankers<br />
					these three have been put away,<br />
					have been grubbed and stubbed,<br />
					like the bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree grew, -<br />
					they have been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as boundless Deliverances are sure,<br />
					the Deliverance they bring is unsurpassed, -<br />
					sure because empty of passion,<br />
					of malevolence,<br />
					and of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is passion,<br />
					it is malevolence,<br />
					it is illusion,<br />
					which harbour aught which clogs;<br />
					in the Arahat who ... be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as Naught Deliverances are sure ...<br />
					and of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is passion,<br />
					it is malevolence,<br />
					it is illusion,<br />
					which create the phenomenal;<br />
					in the Arahat ...<br />
					be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">In so far as non-phenomenal Deliverances are sure,<br />
					the Deliverance they bring is unsurpassed, -<br />
					sure because void of passion,<br />
					of malevolence,<br />
					and of illusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sense in which these several Deliverances are identical in their connotation,<br />
					while differing in denotation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the reverend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Mahā-Koṭṭhita rejoiced in what the reverend Sāriputta had said.</p>
