					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					there arose the following talk<br />
					among a large mumber of Almsmen<br />
					who were sitting together in <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> hall<br />
					after their alms-round and meal: -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sirs,<br />
					it is marvellous<br />
					what powers and might belong to the Truth-finder,<br />
					seeing that he can know<br />
					all about former Buddhas who passed away<br />
					with all lets and hindrances excised,<br />
					with nothing to tie them to rebirth<br />
					and the round of existences,<br />
					and in triumph over all Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows the families from which they came,<br />
					their names and septs,<br />
					their virtues and characters,<br />
					their attainments and outlook,<br />
					and the five modes of Deliverance they respectively won.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, said Ānanda;<br />
					Truth-finders are wonderful<br />
					and of wonderful nature,<br />
					marvellous<br />
					and of marvellous nature.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt119" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg119"><span class="f2">[119]</span></a>	This conversation of those Almsmen was interrupted;<br />
					for the Lord,<br />
					rising up towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					came into hall and,<br />
					seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					asked what they had been talking about<br />
					and what discussion had been broken off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Word for word,<br />
					they told him what had passed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then turning to Ānanda,<br />
					the Lord bade him expand more fully<br />
					the wonders and marvels of a Truth-finder's nature.</p>

					<p class="f4">With my own ears<br />
					and from the Lord's own lips, sir,<br />
					have I heard and received<br />
					the Lord's testimony to me that,<br />
					mindful and fully aware<br />
					of what should happen to him,<br />
					the Bodhisatta passed to don form in the Tusita heaven;<br />
					and this I hold to be wonderful<br />
					and a marvel in the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">With my own ears<br />
					and from the Lord's own lips, sir,<br />
					have I heard and received<br />
					the Lord's own testimony to me that,<br />
					mindful and fully aware,<br />
					the Bodhisatta abode in his Tusita form;<br />
					and this too I hold to be wonderful<br />
					and a marvel in the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">With my own ears<br />
					and from the Lord's own lips, sir,<br />
					have I heard and received<br />
					the Lord's own testimony to me that<br />
					the Bodhisatta abode in his Tusita form<br />
					for the whole term of his existence there;<br />
					and this too I hold to be wonderful<br />
					and a marvel in the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">With my own ears<br />
					and from the Lord's own lips, sir,<br />
					have I heard and received<br />
					the Lord's own testimonies to me that -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> Mindful and fully aware of what should happen,<br />
					the Bodhisatta passed from his Tusita form<br />
					and entered his mother's womb;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt120" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg120"><span class="f2">[120]</span></a> When the Bodhisatta thus passed into his mother s womb,<br />
					then, throughout the entire world<br />
					with its gods<br />
					and Māras and Brahmās,<br />
					there appeared, to all recluses and brahmins<br />
					and to all gods and men,<br />
					a measureless vast effulgence, -<br />
					surpassing the gods' own celestial splendour,<br />
					and penetrating even those vasty and murky<br />
					interspaces between worlds<br />
					where gloomy darkness reigns<br />
					and no light may enter of sun and moon<br />
					for all their power and might,<br />
					so that by this effulgence<br />
					the denizens of those interspaces<br />
					could behold one another<br />
					and recognize that<br />
					other creatures dwell with them there;<br />
					and withal the ten thousand worlds<br />
					trembled and shook and quaked;<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as the Bodhisatta has entered his mother's womb,<br />
					four deities draw nigh him<br />
					to guard the four cardinal points<br />
					so that no one -<br />
					human, non-human or whatever he might be -<br />
					should do a mischief<br />
					to either the Bodhisatta or his mother;</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as the Bodhisatta has entered his mother's womb,<br />
					she becomes intrinsically virtuous, -<br />
					eschewing the taking of life<br />
					and the taking of anything not given to her,<br />
					eschewing pleasures of sense and incontinence,<br />
					eschewing lies<br />
					and all temptation to strong drink;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt121" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg121"><span class="f2">[121]</span></a> As soon as the Bodhisatta has entered into his mother's womb,<br />
					she has no carnal mind for any man,<br />
					nor can she yield to any man's passion for her;</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as the Bodhisatta has entered his mother's womb,<br />
					all the five pleasures of sense become hers;<br />
					she is lapped and wrapped<br />
					in all the enjoyment they can bring;</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as the Bodhisatta has entered his mother's womb,<br />
					no ailments can come upon her;<br />
					comfortable and unwearied of body,<br />
					she views within her womb <a id="pg225"><span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span></a> the Bodhisatta<br />
					with all his limbs and faculties complete; -<br />
					just as a sparkling veluriya gem of finest water,<br />
					which has been cut with eight facets<br />
					and marvellously wrought,<br />
					and through which passes a blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red,<br />
					white,<br />
					or yellowish thread,<br />
					is seen as being what it is<br />
					by a man with eyes to see<br />
					who takes it in his hand to examine it;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt122" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg122"><span class="f2">[122]</span></a>	Seven days after his birth<br />
					the mother of the Bodhisatta dies<br />
					and passes to the Tusita heaven;</p>

					<p class="f4">While other women carry their child<br />
					some nine or ten months,<br />
					it is otherwise with a Bodhisatta's mother,<br />
					who brings forth her child<br />
					after exactly ten months;</p>

					<p class="f4">While other women give birth to their child<br />
					sitting or lying,<br />
					it is otherwise with a Bodhisatta's mother,<br />
					who gives birth standing erect;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Bodhisatta issues from his mother's womb,<br />
					he is received into the hands<br />
					first of gods<br />
					and afterwards of human beings;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Bodhisatta issues from his mother's womb,<br />
					he never touches the ground<br />
					but is received by the four deities<br />
					who present him to his mother<br />
					with these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejoice, o queen!<br />
					you have borne indeed a lordly son!</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Bodhisatta issues from his mother's womb,<br />
					he issues without stain<br />
					and without defilement<br />
					from waters<br />
					or humours<br />
					or blood<br />
					or any <a id="pt128" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg128"><span class="f2">[128]</span></a> uncleanness,<br />
					but pure and stainless, -<br />
					just like a gem on Benares muslin,<br />
					where neither defiles the other<br />
					because both are pure;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Bodhisatta issues from his mother's womb,<br />
					there start from mid-air<br />
					two jets of water,<br />
					one cold and the other warm,<br />
					wherewith they bathe the Bodhisatta and his mother;</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as he is born,<br />
					the Bodhisatta firmly plants both feet flat on the ground,<br />
					takes seven strides to the North,<br />
					with a white canopy carried above his head,<br />
					and surveys each quarter of the world,<br />
					exclaiming in peerless tones:</p>

					<p class="f4">In all the world I am chief,<br />
					best and foremost;<br />
					this is my last birth;<br />
					I shall never be born again;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg226"><span class="f2 g"><b>[226]</b></span></a> As soon as the Bodhisatta issues from his mother's womb,<br />
					throughout the entire world<br />
					with its gods<br />
					and Māras and Brahmās<br />
					there appears, to all recluses and brahmins<br />
					and to all gods and men,<br />
					a measureless and vast effulgence, -<br />
					surpassing the gods' own celestial splendour<br />
					and penetrating even those vasty and murky<br />
					interspaces between worlds<br />
					where gloomy darkness reigns<br />
					and no light may enter of sun and moon<br />
					for all their power and might,<br />
					so that <a id="pt124" href="../../pali/mn/mn.123.pali.bd.htm#pg124"><span class="f2">[124]</span></a>  by this effulgence<br />
					the denizens of those interspaces<br />
					could behold one another<br />
					and recognize that<br />
					other creatures dwell with them there;<br />
					and withal the ten thousand worlds<br />
					trembled and shook and quake;</p>

					<p class="f4">and this too, sir,<br />
					I hold to be - like all the foregoing -<br />
					wonderful and a marvel in the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Add this too, Ānanda, -<br />
					that the Truth-finder has full knowledge of feelings -<br />
					and perceptions -<br />
					and thoughts -<br />
					as they arise and appear and pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Add this, Ānanda,<br />
					to your tale of the Truth-finder's wonders and marvels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inasmuch, sir, as the Lord has full knowledge<br />
					of feelings and perceptions and thoughts<br />
					as they arise and appear and pass away, -<br />
					this too, sir,<br />
					do I hold to be wonderful and a marvel in the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the reverendĀnanda<br />
					and the Master approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the reverend Ānanda had said.</p>
