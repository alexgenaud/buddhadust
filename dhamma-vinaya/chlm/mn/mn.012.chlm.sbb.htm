					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					outside the town<br />
					in the dense forest to the west,<br />
					Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />
					who had recently left this creed and rule,<br />
					was telling people there was nothing superhuman<br />
					about the recluse Gotama's ennobling gifts of knowledge and insight,<br />
					that it was Gotama's own reasoning<br />
					which had hammered out a Doctrine of his own evolving<br />
					and of his personal invention,<br />
					such that whoso hears it preached for his good<br />
					has only to act up to it<br />
					to be guided to the utter ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in the morning early the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went for alms into Vesālī,<br />
					where he heard Sunakkhatta saying this.</p>

					<p class="f4">On his return after his meal,<br />
					Sāriputta came to the Lord<br />
					and with due obeisance took a seat aside,<br />
					telling the Lord what Sunakkhatta was saying.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sunakkhatta' -<br />
					was the Lord s reply -<br />
					is a man of wrath and folly;<br />
					wrath prompted his remarks;<br />
					yet, though dispraise is his object,<br />
					the foolish person is actually singing the Truth-finder's praises.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, praise it is when a man:<br />
					'Whoso hears it preached for his good<br />
					has to act up to it<br />
					to be guided to the utter ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Never, Sāriputta, will this foolish person attain to the Doctrine's teaching about myself that -</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					knowing all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of <a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> enlightenment.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Never will this foolish person attain to the Doctrine's teaching about myself that -</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Lord in whom reside all psychic powers:</p>

					<p class="f4">from being one to become manifold,<br />
					from being manifold to become one,</p>

					<p class="f4">to be visible or invisible,</p>

					<p class="f4">to pass at will through wall or fence or hill as if through air,</p>

					<p class="f4">to pass in and out of the solid earth as if it were water,</p>

					<p class="f4">to walk on the water's unbroken surface as if it were the solid earth,</p>

					<p class="f4">to glide in state through the air like a bird on the wing,</p>

					<p class="f4">to touch and to handle the moon and sun in their power and might,</p>

					<p class="f4">and to extend the sovereignty of his body right up to the Brahma world.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Never will this foolish person attain to the Doctrine's teaching about myself that -</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Lord<br />
					who, with the Ear Celestial,<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					hears both heavenly and human sounds.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Never will this foolish person attain to the Doctrines teaching about myself that -</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is the Lord<br />
					who with his own heart<br />
					comprehends the heart of other creatures<br />
					and of other men<br />
					so as to know them for just what they are, -<br />
					filled with passion or free from passion, ...<br />
					focussed or wandering,<br />
					large-minded or small-minded,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />

					Delivered or lacking Deliverance.'</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Ten in number, Sāriputta,<br />
					are a Truth-finder's powers,<br />
					whereby he knows his precedence as leader of the herd,<br />
					issues his lion-like challenges in public assemblies<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and sets a-rolling the excellent Wheel of Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the ten powers are these:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) The Truth-finder knows precisely both what is<br />
					and what is not<br />
					a specific cause;</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) he knows the precise nature<br />
					of the consequences that must inevitably result<br />
					from everything done in the past, present and future;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg47"><span class="f2 g"><b>[47]</b></span></a> (iii) he knows the precise nature of the future<br />
					to which every course leads;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) he knows the precise nature<br />
					of the manifold and diverse physical factors<br />
					which make up the world;</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) he knows the precise nature<br />
					of each creature's particular bent;</p>

					<p class="f4">(vi) he knows the precise nature<br />
					of all that is going on in the hearts of others;</p>

					<p class="f4">(vii) he knows the precise nature<br />
					of the imperfections,<br />
					the specific stage,<br />
					or the uprising<br />
					of the several achievements of Ecstasy,<br />
					Deliverance,<br />
					and Rapt Concentration;</p>

					<p class="f4">(viii) he recalls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth ... (etc. as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>) right up to the time when he passed to his present life here;</p>

					<p class="f4">(ix) he sees-with the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human eye -<br />
					creatures in the act of passing hence<br />
					and re-appearing elsewhere,<br />
					creatures high and low ...<br />
					(etc. as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>);</p>

					<p class="f4">(x) [71] by eradicating the Cankers, he -<br />
					here and now,<br />
					of and by himself -<br />
					comprehends,<br />
					realizes,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in the Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which knows no Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the Truth-finder's ten powers,<br />
					whereby he knows his precedence as leader of the herd,<br />
					issues his lion-like challenge in public assemblies<br />
					and sets a-rolling the excellent Wheel of Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if of me who know and see all this<br />
					anyone were to say<br />
					that there is nothing superhuman<br />
					about the recluse Gotama's ennobling gifts<br />
					or his knowledge and insight,<br />
					and that it is Gotama's own reasoning<br />
					which has hammered out a Doctrine<br />
					of his own evolving and personal invention, -<br />
					if such a one does not recant these words of his,<br />
					change his heart,<br />
					and renounce his view,<br />
					he will find himself hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an Almsman <a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> who is equipped with virtue,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					and insight<br />
					will here and now<br />
					come to (the Arahat's) plenitude of knowledge,<br />
					so this other equipment -<br />
					if the man does not recant his words,<br />
					change his heart,<br />
					and renounce his view -<br />
					will end in his being hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Four in number are a Truth-finder's assurances<br />
					whereby he knows his precedence as leader of the herd,<br />
					issues his lion-like challenge in public assemblies,<br />
					and sets a-rolling the Excellent Wheel of Truth;<br />
					and the four are these:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) I see nothing to indicate that anyone -<br />
					be he recluse<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or god<br />
					or Māra<br />
					or Brahmā<br />
					or anyone else in the wide world -<br />
					will, with justice,<br />
					charge me with lacking enlightenment<br />
					on those states of mind<br />
					on which I profess to be all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as I see nothing to indicate this,<br />
					my state is one of tranquillity,<br />
					fearlessness,<br />
					and assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) I see nothing to indicate that anyone ...<br />
					will, with justice,<br />
					charge me with not having extirpated the Cankers as I profess.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as I see nothing to indicate this,<br />
					my state is one of tranquillity,<br />
					fearlessness,<br />
					and assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) I see nothing to indicate that anyone ...<br />
					will, with justice,<br />
					charge it against me<br />
					that the states of mind which I have declared to be stumbling-blocks,<br />
					are not such at all,<br />
					to him who indulges in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as I see nothing to indicate this,<br />
					my state is one of tranquillity,<br />
					fearlessness,<br />
					and assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) I see nothing to indicate that anyone ...<br />
					will, with justice,<br />
					charge it against me<br />
					that the Doctrine I have preached<br />
					for the profit of whomsoever it be,<br />
					fails, if he acts up to it,<br />
					to guide him to the utter ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as I see nothing to indicate this,<br />
					my state is one of tranquillity,<br />
					fearlessness,<br />
					and assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the Truth-finder's four assurances<br />
					whereby he knows his precedence as leader of the herd,<br />
					issues his lion-like challenge in public assemblies,<br />
					and sets a-rolling the excellent Wheel of Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if of me who know and see all this<br />
					anyone were to say<br />
					there is <a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> nothing superhuman about the recluse Gotama ...<br />
					will end in his being hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight in number are the assemblies,<br />
					namely the assemblies of nobles,<br />
					brahmins,<br />
					heads of houses,<br />
					recluses,<br />
					the four Great Regents,<br />
					the Thirty-three gods,<br />
					Māra<br />
					and Brahma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strong in the aforesaid four assurances,<br />
					I have experience of going to some hundreds<br />
					of each of these eight assemblies,<br />
					sitting and talking with them and holding converse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet never did I see anything to indicate<br />
					that fear or nervousness would come upon me.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as I saw nothing to indicate this,<br />
					my state is one of tranquillity,<br />
					fearlessness,<br />
					and assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if of me who know and see all this<br />
					anyone were to say<br />
					that there is nothing superhuman about the recluse Gotama ...<br />
					will end in his being hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Four in number<br />
					are the modes in which life is engendered, -<br />
					from the egg,<br />
					from the womb,<br />
					from moisture,<br />
					and by translation.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the egg<br />
					are those creatures said to be born<br />
					who at birth break the shell that contains them.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the womb<br />
					are those creatures said to be born<br />
					who at birth break the womb.</p>

					<p class="f4">From moisture<br />
					are those creatures said to be born<br />
					who are born in putrid fish,<br />
					corpses,<br />
					or rice,<br />
					or in refuse-pools<br />
					or rubbish-shoots.</p>

					<p class="f4">By translation<br />
					come gods,<br />
					denizens of purgatory,<br />
					some human beings<br />
					and some dwellers in the four states of woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if of me who know and see all this<br />
					anyone were to say<br />
					that there is nothing superhuman about the recluse Gotama ...<br />
					will end in his being hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Five in number are the destinies after life, -<br />
					in purgatory,<br />
					as an animal,<br />
					as a ghost,<br />
					as a human being,<br />
					and as a god.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purgatory I know,<br />
					the road thereto,<br />
					the courses that lead to it,<br />
					and what courses a man pursues<br />
					to pass, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					to rebirth in some unhappy state<br />
					of misery<br />
					or woe<br />
					or purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">The animal world I know,<br />
					and the worlds of ghosts and men,<br />
					together with the roads to each,<br />
					the courses that lead to each<br />
					and what courses a man pursues<br />
					to pass to each, at the body's dissolution after <a id="pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span></a> death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gods I know,<br />
					the road thereto,<br />
					and the courses that lead to their world,<br />
					and what courses a man pursues<br />
					to pass, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					to a state of blessedness in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">I know too Nirvana,<br />
					the road leading thereto,<br />
					the courses that lead to it,<br />
					and what courses a man pursues to dwell -<br />
					here and now -<br />
					by the extirpation of the Cankers,<br />
					in that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which knows no Cankers,<br />
					a Deliverance which he has,<br />
					for and by himself,<br />
					thought out and realized,<br />
					so as to enter and to abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tells me that his courses<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he has taken<br />
					are such as will bring him<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to a state of suffering and woe or purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on, with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					I duly see him,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					in some state of suffering and woe or purgatory,<br />
					there experiencing violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a pit,<br />
					over a man's height deep,<br />
					filled with embers<br />
					showing neither flame nor smoke;<br />
					and if there drew near a man<br />
					overcome and overpowered by the midsummer heat,<br />
					exhausted<br />
					and beside himself with thirst,<br />
					making straight for the ember-pit ahead of him;<br />
					and if a man with eyes to discern<br />
					were to observe him<br />
					and say his course<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he was taking<br />
					would surely bring him to that very pit of embers;<br />
					and if later that observer were to see the wayfarer<br />
					fallen into the pit of embers,<br />
					there experiencing violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain; -<br />
					even so does my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tell me that his courses and behaviour ...<br />
					and racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, again, that my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tells me that his courses<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he has taken<br />
					are such as will bring him<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to rebirth as an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on, with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					I duly <a id="pg51"><span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></a> see him,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					reborn as an animal<br />
					and experiencing, as such,<br />
					violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a jakes,<br />
					a man's height deep,<br />
					full up with ordure,<br />
					and if there drew near a man<br />
					overcome and overpowered by the midsummer heat ...<br />
					(etc. as in previous paragraph, substituting ordure for embers)<br />
					... racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, suppose that my heart's knowledge of ...<br />
					reborn as a ghost,<br />
					there experiencing, as such,<br />
					violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if on rugged ground<br />
					there grew a tree<br />
					with but the tiniest leaves and foliage<br />
					and with but meagre strips of shade beneath;<br />
					and if there drew near a man<br />
					overcome and overpowered by the midsummer heat,<br />
					exhausted and beside himself with thirst,<br />
					making straight for the tree ahead of him;<br />
					and if a man with eyes to discern<br />
					were to observe him<br />
					and to say that his course<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he was taking<br />
					would surely bring him to that very tree;<br />
					and if later that observer were to see the wayfarer<br />
					seated or lying under that tree's shade,<br />
					experiencing violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain; -<br />
					even so does my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tell me that his courses<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he has taken<br />
					are such as to bring him,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					to rebirth as a ghost,<br />
					there to experience violent,<br />
					acute<br />
					and racking pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, suppose that my heart's knowledge of<br />
					... reborn as a man,<br />
					there experiencing much felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if on level ground<br />
					there grew a tree<br />
					with thick luxuriant foliage<br />
					and with dense shade beneath;<br />
					and if there drew near a man overcome<br />
					and overpowered by the midsummer heat,<br />
					exhausted and beside himself with thirst,<br />
					making straight for the tree ahead of him;<br />
					and if a man with eyes to discern<br />

					there experiencing much felicity; -<br />
					even so does my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tell me that his courses<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he has taken<br />
					are such as to bring him,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					to rebirth among mankind,<br />
					there to experience much felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg52"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></a> Or, fourthly, suppose that my heart's knowledge of<br />
					... reborn in bliss in heaven,<br />
					there experiencing exceedingly great felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a palace<br />
					and in it a gabled pavilion,<br />
					plastered within and without,<br />
					sheltered from winds,<br />
					complete with well-barred doors,<br />
					and windows that fasten;<br />
					and if within this pavilion<br />
					there were a divan,<br />
					spread with white coverlets<br />
					of fleecy wool<br />
					embroidered with flowers,<br />
					strewn over with rare antelope-skins as rugs,<br />
					and furnished with counterpanes<br />
					and a red cushion at either end;<br />
					and if there drew near<br />
					a man overcome ...<br />
					see the wayfarer seated or lying on that divan<br />
					in exceedingly great felicity; -<br />
					even so does my heart's knowledge ...<br />
					there to experience exceedingly great felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, lastly, suppose that my heart's knowledge<br />
					of the heart of a given man<br />
					tells me that his courses<br />
					and behaviour<br />
					and the road he has taken<br />
					are such as will,<br />
					by the extirpation of the Cankers,<br />
					ensure his dwelling -<br />
					here and now -<br />
					in that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which knows no Cankers,<br />
					a Deliverance which he has,<br />
					for and by hjmself,<br />
					thought out and realized,<br />
					so as to enter and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on, with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					I duly see him with his Deliverance achieved,<br />
					experiencing exceedingly great felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a lotus-pond<br />
					of clear pleasant cool gleaming water<br />
					with firm banks<br />
					and in every way delightful,<br />
					with a dense wood hard by;<br />
					and if there drew near a man overcome ...<br />
					see the wayfarer -<br />
					after going down to the pond<br />
					and there bathing<br />
					and drinking<br />
					and easing his weary frame<br />
					of all its fatigue and distress -<br />
					come out of the water<br />
					and sit or lie down<br />
					in the dense wood<br />
					in exceedingly great felicity; -<br />
					even so does my heart's knowledge ...<br />
					with his Deliverance achieved,<br />
					experiencing exceedingly great felicity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the five destinies hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if of me who know and see all this<br />

					about the recluse Gotama's ennobling gifts<br />
					or his knowledge and insight,<br />
					and that <a id="pg53"><span class="f2 g"><b>[53]</b></span></a> it is Gotama's own reasoning<br />

					if such a one does not recant these words of his,<br />

					and renounce his view,<br />
					he will find himself hauled off to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a Brother<br />

					<p class="f4">Aye, Sāriputta,<br />

					I have been an ascetic of ascetics;<br />
					loathly have I been,<br />
					foremost in loathliness;<br />
					scrupulous have I been,<br />
					foremost in scrupulosity;<br />
					solitary have I been,<br />
					foremost in solitude.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(i.) To such a pitch of asceticism have I gone<br />
					that<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> naked was I,<br />
					<a id="flouting">flouting</a> life's decencies,<br />
					licking my hands after meals,<br />
					never heeding when folk called to me to come or to stop,<br />
					never accepting food brought to me before my rounds<br />
					or cooked expressly for me,<br />
					never accepting an invitation,<br />
					never receiving food direct from pot or pan<br />
					or within the threshould<br />
					or among the faggots or pestles,<br />
					never from (one only of) two people messing together,<br />
					never from a pregnant woman<br />
					or a nursing mother<br />
					or a woman <i>in coitu,</i><br />
					never from gleanings (in time of famine)<br />
					nor from where a dog is ready at hand<br />
					or where (hungry) flies congregate,<br />
					never touching flesh<br />
					or fish<br />
					or spirits<br />
					or strong drink<br />
					or brews of grain.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have visited only one house a day<br />
					and there taken only one morsel;<br />
					or I have visited but two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven houses a day<br />
					and taken at each only two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven morsels;<br />
					I have lived on a single saucer of food a day,<br />
					or on two,<br />
					or (up to) seven saucers;<br />
					I have had but one meal a day,<br />
					or one every two days,<br />
					or (so on, up to) every seven days,<br />
					or only once a fort- <a id="pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></a> night,<br />
					on a rigid scale of rationing.</p>

					<p class="f4">My sole diet has been herbs gathered green,<br />
					or the grain of wild millets and paddy,<br />
					or snippets of hide,<br />
					or water-plants,<br />
					or the red powder round rice-grains within the husk,<br />
					or the discarded scum of rice on the boil,<br />
					or the flour of oilseeds,<br />
					or grass,<br />
					or cow-dung.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have lived on wild roots and fruit,<br />
					or on windfalls only.</p>

					<p class="f4">My raiment has been of hemp<br />
					or of hempen mixture,<br />
					of cerements,<br />
					of rags from the dust-heap,<br />
					of bark,<br />
					of the black antelope's pelt<br />
					either whole or split down the middle,<br />
					of grass,<br />
					of strips of bark or wood,<br />
					of hair of men or animals woven into a blanket,<br />
					or of owls' wings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In fulfilment of my vows,<br />
					I have plucked out the hair of my head<br />
					and the hair of my beard,<br />
					have never quitted the upright for the sitting posture,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					have squatted and never risen up,<br />
					moving only a-squat,<br />
					have couched on thorns,<br />
					have gone down to the water punctually<br />
					thrice before nightfall<br />
					to wash (away the evil within).</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise,<br />
					in divers fashions,<br />
					have I lived to torment and to torture my body; -<br />
					to such a length in asceticism have I gone.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii.) To such a length have I gone in loathliness<br />
					that on my body I have accumulated the dirt and filth of years<br />
					till it dropped off of itself, -<br />
					even as the rank growths of years<br />
					fall away from the stump of a Tinduka-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">But never once came the thought to me<br />
					to clean it off with my own hands<br />
					or to get others to clean it off for me; -<br />
					to such a length in loathliness have I gone.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii.) To such a length in scrupulosity have I gone<br />
					that my footsteps out and in<br />
					were always attended by a mindfulness<br />
					so vigilant as to awake compassion within me<br />
					over even a drop of water<br />
					lest I might harm tiny creatures in crevices; -<br />
					to such a length have I gone in scrupulosity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv.) To such a length have I gone<br />

						</div>

					<p class="f4">When the cowherds had driven their herds forth from the byres,<br />
					up I came on all fours<br />
					to find a subsistence on the droppings of the young milch-cows.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long as my own dung and urine held out,<br />
					on that I have subsisted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So foul a filth-eater was I.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I took up my abode in the awesome depths of the forest,<br />
					depths so awesome that it was reputed<br />
					that none but the passion-less could venture in<br />
					without his hair standing on end.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the cold season<br />
					brought chill wintry nights,<br />
					then it was that,<br />
					in the dark half of the months<br />
					when snow was falling,<br />
					I dwelt by night in the open air<br />
					and in the dank thicket by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when there came<br />
					the last broiling month of summer<br />
					before the rains,<br />
					I made my dwelling<br />
					under the baking sun by day<br />
					and in the stifling thicket by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there flashed on me these verses,<br />
					never till then uttered by any:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Now scorched, now frore, in forest dread, alone,<br />
							naked and fireless, set upon his quest,<br />
							the hermit battles purity to win.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In a charnel ground<br />
					I lay me down<br />
					with charred bones for pillow.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">When the cowherds' boys came along,<br />
					they spat and staled upon me,<br />
					pelted me with dirt,<br />
					and stuck bits of wood into my ears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I declare that<br />
					never did I let an evil mood against them<br />
					arise within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So poised in equanimity was I.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> Some recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who say and hold<br />
					that purity cometh by way of food,<br />
					and accordingly proclaim<br />
					that they live exclusively on jujube-fruits,<br />
					which, in one form or other,<br />
					constitute their sole meat and drink.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I can claim to have lived on a single jujube-fruit a day.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this leads you to think<br />
					that this fruit was larger in those days,<br />
					you would err;<br />
					for, it was precisely the same size then<br />
					that it is to-day.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I was living on a single fruit a day,<br />
					my body grew emaciated in the extreme;<br />
					because I ate so little,<br />
					my members,<br />
					great and small,<br />
					grew like the knotted joints of withered creepers;<br />
					like a buffalo's hoof<br />
					were my shrunken buttocks;<br />
					like the twists in a rope<br />
					were my spinal vertebrae;<br />
					like the crazy rafters<br />
					of a tumbledown roof,<br />
					that start askew and aslant,<br />
					were my gaunt ribs;<br />
					like the starry gleams on water<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of a well,<br />
					shone my gleaming eyes<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of their sockets;<br />
					and as the rind of a cut gourd<br />
					shrinks and shrivels in the heat,<br />
					so shrank and shrivelled<br />
					the scalp of my head, -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I sought to feel my belly,<br />
					it was my backbone<br />
					which I found in my grasp;<br />
					if I sought to feel my backbone,<br />
					I found myself grasping my belly,<br />
					so closely did my belly cleave to my backbone; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I wanted to retire<br />
					for the calls of nature,<br />
					down I fell on my face; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If for ease of body<br />
					I chafed my limbs,<br />
					the hairs of my body<br />
					fell away under my hand,<br />
					rotted at their roots; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Other recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who, saying and holding<br />
					that purity cometh by way of food,<br />
					proclaim that they live exclusively on beans -<br />
					or sesamum -<br />
					or rice -<br />
					as their sole meat and drink.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I can claim to have lived<br />
					on a single bean a day -<br />
					on a single sesamum seed a day -<br />
					or a single grain of rice a day;<br />
					and [the result was still the same].</p>

					<p class="f4">Never did this practice<br />
					or these courses<br />
					or these dire austerities<br />
					bring me to the ennobling gifts of super- <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> human knowledge and insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because none of them lead to that noble understanding<br />
					which, when won,<br />
					leads on to Deliverance<br />
					and guides him who lives up to it<br />
					onward to the utter extinction of all Ill.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, there are other recluses and brahmins<br />
					who say and hold<br />
					that purity cometh by way of successive transmigrations, -<br />
					or of a particular rebirth -<br />
					or particular abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, it would not be easy to find the transmigration<br />
					or rebirth<br />
					or abode<br />
					that has not been mine in all this long past of mine, -<br />
					save and except the heaven of the pure abode.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And even if I were to transmigrate to -<br />
					or be reborn in -<br />
					or abide among the gods of that particular heaven,<br />
					I could never more return to earth.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, there are recluses and brahmins<br />
					who say and hold<br />
					that purity cometh by sacrificing<br />
					or by fire-ritual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it would not be easy to find<br />
					either the sacrifice which I have not offered<br />
					or the fire-ritual which I have not performed, -<br />
					whether as a king<br />
					anointed as such from among the nobles,<br />
					or as a brahmin magnate.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, there are recluses and brahmins<br />
					who say and hold that,<br />
					as long as a man is in the prime of his youth and early manhood,<br />
					with a wealth of coal-black hair untouched by grey,<br />
					and in all the beauty of his prime, -<br />
					so long only are the powers of his mind at their best;<br />
					but that when he has grown broken and old,<br />
					aged and stricken in years,<br />
					and draws to his life's close,<br />
					then the powers of his mind are in decay.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not so.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself am now broken and old,<br />
					aged and stricken in years<br />
					and at the close of my life,<br />
					being now round about eighty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine now that I had four disciples -<br />
					each living to be a full hundred,<br />
					each of perfect alertness,<br />
					resolve,<br />
					and power to reproduce and expound, -<br />
					four disciples as perfect in their <a id="pg58"><span class="f2 g"><b>[58]</b></span></a> scope<br />
					as a mighty archer of renown,<br />
					so skilled and dexterous with his bow<br />
					and so schooled in its use<br />
					that he can with ease<br />
					shoot even a feather-weight shaft<br />
					right over a towering palm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine further that these four gifted disciples<br />
					ply me with questions (say)<br />
					about mustering-up mindfulness,<br />
					receive my answers,<br />
					take in my exposition as expounded to them,<br />
					never put to me a single subsidiary question,<br />
					and never pause in their questioning<br />
					except for meals,<br />
					for the calls of nature,<br />
					and for necessary repose. -<br />
					Still uncompleted withal<br />
					would be the Truth-finder's teaching,<br />
					still uncompleted would be<br />
					his exposition of the Sayings,<br />
					still uncompleted would be<br />
					his answers to their questions;<br />
					but meantime my four disciples<br />
					would have lived out their allotted century<br />
					and would have expired.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you have to carry me about on a litter, Sāriputta,<br />
					yet will my mind still retain its powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of me, if of anyone,<br />
					it may truly be said<br />
					that in me a being without delusions<br />
					has appeared in the world<br />
					for the welfare and good of many,<br />
					out of compassion towards the world,<br />
					for the profit,<br />
					welfare<br />
					and good of gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time the venerable Nāgasamāla was standing behind the Lord,<br />
					fanning him;<br />
					and he said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir;<br />
					marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">As I listened to this discourse,<br />
					the hairs of my body stood on end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the title of this discourse?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, then, Nāgasamāla,<br />
					treasure it up in your memory as<br />
					'the Grisly discourse.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Nāgasamāla rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
