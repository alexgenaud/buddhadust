					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Ānanda was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the hamlet of Beluva,<br />
					the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhaka Town,<br />
					who had gone to Pāṭaliputta on some business or other,<br />
					came to an Almsman in the Kukkuṭa pleasaunce<br />
					and, seating himself after salutations,<br />
					asked where Ānanda was staying,<br />
					as he would like to see him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being informed that Ānanda was staying at Vesālī<br />
					in the hamlet of Beluva,<br />
					Dasama, after finishing his business at Pāṭaliputta, proceeded to Vesālī<br />
					and the hamlet of Beluva,<br />
					where he found Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seating himself after salutations,<br />
					Dasama asked Ānanda this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					indicated one particular state of consciousness<br />
					whereby an Almsman who lives the strenuous life<br />
					purged of self,<br />
					either finds Deliverance for his prisoned heart,<br />
					or sees the extirpation of Cankers hitherto rampant,<br />
					Or wins at last<br />
					that utter peace which was not his before?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he has.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt350" href="../../pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg350"><span class="f2">[350]</span></a> What is it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, householder,<br />
					of an Almsman who, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					and divested of wrong <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span></a> states of consciousness,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and dwells in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting that this First Ecstasy<br />
					is only a product,<br />
					evolved by thought,<br />
					he comes to know that all products evolved by thought<br />
					are fleeting<br />
					and must cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking his stand on this,<br />
					he attains to extirpation of Cankers,<br />
					or, if he does not attain this,<br />
					then by his passion for righteousness<br />
					and by his delight in righteousness<br />
					he destroys the Five Fetters which entail re-birth<br />
					and is translated hereafter<br />
					to realms above,<br />
					from which he will never return again to earth<br />
					but will there win his Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness<br />
					indicated by the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					whereby an Almsman who lives the strenuous life<br />
					purged of self<br />
					both finds Deliverance for his prisoned heart,<br />
					and sees the extirpation of Cankers hitherto rampant,<br />
					and wins at last<br />
					that utter peace which was not his before.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, an Almsman,<br />
					rising above observation and reasoning,<br />
					successively enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second -<br />
					the Third -<br />
					and the Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting that each of these also<br />
					is only a product,<br />
					evolved by thought,<br />
					he comes to know that all products ...<br />
					utter peace which was not his before.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt351" href="../../pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg351"><span class="f2">[351]</span></a> Further, an Almsman dwells<br />
					with radiant good-will pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second -<br />
					a third -<br />
					and then the fourth quarter,<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world -<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere -<br />
					with radiant good-will,<br />
					all-embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					wherein no hate or malice finds a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as with good-will,<br />
					so in turn he pervades with radiant pity -<br />
					and sympathy -<br />
					and poised equanimity<br />
					the whole length and breadth of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting that each of these four<br />
					also is only a product,<br />
					evolved by thought,<br />
					he comes to know that all products ... <a id="pt352" href="../../pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg352"><span class="f2">[352]</span></a> utter peace which was not his before.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by passing altogether beyond perception of material objects,<br />
					by ceasing from perception of sense- <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a> reactions,<br />
					and by not heeding perception of differences,<br />
					an Almsman comes to hold space to be infinite<br />
					and so enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by passing altogether beyond this plane,<br />
					the Almsman comes to hold consciousness to be infinite<br />
					and so enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, by passing altogether beyond this plane,<br />
					the Almsman comes to hold that Naught is<br />
					and so enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reflecting that each of these three planes<br />
					also is only a product,<br />
					evolved by thought,<br />
					he comes to know that all products ...<br />
					utter peace which was not his before.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the close of these words,<br />
					the householder Dasama from Aṭṭhaka Town said to Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man who,<br />
					being in quest of a single treasure-trove,<br />
					should at one haul find eleven,<br />
					<a id="pt353" href="../../pali/mn/mn.052.pali.bd.htm#pg353"><span class="f2">[353]</span></a> even so have I,<br />
					in my quest for a single portal to Nirvana,<br />
					been told of eleven portals.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man with an eleven-doored house,<br />
					could, if a fire broke out,<br />
					escape to safety<br />
					by any single one of those eleven doors,<br />
					even so shall I be able to escape to safety<br />
					by any single one of these eleven portals of Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of other creeds<br />
					will always look for a fee for the teacher;<br />
					so why should not I show worship to the reverend Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">So, assembling together the Almsmen from Pāṭaliputta and Vesālī,<br />
					Dasama provided them with an excellent meal<br />
					of food both hard and soft,<br />
					which he served to them with his own hands,<br />
					till all had had their fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, he presented two lengths of cloth<br />
					to each Almsman for apparel,<br />
					but a suit of three robes<br />
					to the reverend Ānanda,<br />
					for whom further<br />
					he caused a cell to be built<br />
					at a cost of five hundred pieces.</p>
