					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_angas">Angas'</a> country,<br />
					where they have a township named <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#assapura">Assapura,</a><br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Recluses! Recluses!' -<br />
					that is the name by which people know you<br />
					and by which you would describe yourselves,<br />
					if asked who you were.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being your vocation and profession as recluses,<br />
					you must train yourselves to embrace<br />
					and shew forth in your lives<br />
					the states of consciousness<br />
					which really make the recluse and brahmin -<br />
					so as to prove your vocation true<br />
					and your profession a reality,<br />
					and to see to it that the charity you enjoy<br />
					in the shape of clothing<br />
					and food<br />
					and other requisites<br />
					enures to fruit and profit in yourselves,<br />
					making your Pilgrimage not barren<br />
					but fruitful unto its harvest.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the states of consciousness<br />
					which really make the recluse and the brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Train yourselves to be conscientious and scrupulous.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that,<br />
					feeling yourselves to be conscientious and scrupulous,<br />
					you may rest content in the idea that this is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough,<br />
					that you have realized the recluse's ideal,<br />
					and that you have nothing still ahead of you to accomplish.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I say unto you, and rejoin,<br />
					that in your quest for recluse-ship,<br />
					you must not fall short of the recluses ideal,<br />
					while there is something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ahead of you?</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourselves in deed -<br />
					in word -<br />
					in thought -<br />
					and in mode of livelihood -<br />
					to be pure and frank and open,<br />
					without flaw<br />
					and without reserve,<br />
					yet not so as to be puffed up<br />
					<a id="pg192"><span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span></a> and to run down others.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that,<br />
					feeling yourselves to be thus trained,<br />
					as well as conscientious and scrupulous<br />
					you may rest content in the idea<br />
					that each successive stage is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough, ...<br />
					something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ahead?</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourselves<br />
					to guard the portals of the senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with the eye<br />
					you see a visible shape,<br />
					you must resolve not to be taken<br />
					with its detailed marks and signs,<br />
					since, uncontrolled,<br />
					the eye might lead to appetite and distress,<br />
					and to evil and wrong states of consciousness;<br />
					your resolve will be<br />
					to control the sense of sight,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to bring the eye under control.</p>

					<p class="f4">... And similarly with all the other senses. ...</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that,<br />
					with each fresh achievement in turn,<br />
					you may rest content, -<br />
					in the idea that each successive stage is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough, ...<br />
					something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ahead?</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourselves<br />
					to moderation in food,<br />
					taking food with deliberate purposefulness,<br />
					not for pleasure or delight,<br />
					not for ostentation or display,<br />
					but only to the extent required<br />
					to support and maintain the body,<br />
					to shield it from hurt,<br />
					and to foster the higher life, -<br />
					with the resolve on your part<br />
					to destroy the old feelings<br />
					and not to allow any new feelings to arise,<br />
					to the end that<br />
					the blameless lot may be yours<br />
					and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that -<br />
					feeling you are conscientious and scrupulous,<br />
					pure in deed, word, thought and mode of livelihood,<br />
					and moderate in food, -<br />
					you may rest content in the idea that this is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough ...<br />
					something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ahead?</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourselves to vigilance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purge your hearts of besetting states of consciousness, -<br />
					by day as you either pace to and fro or are seated, -<br />
					in the first watch of the night<br />
					as you either pace to and fro or are seated;<br />
					in the middle watch of the night<br />
					as you lie couched lion-like on your right side,<br />
					foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful and selfpossessed,<br />
					with your thoughts set on the appointed <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> time to get up;<br />
					or, again, during the last watch of the night<br />
					when you have risen<br />
					and either pace to and fro or are seated.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that -<br />
					feeling you are conscientious and scrupulous,<br />
					pure in deed, word, thought, and mode of livelihood,<br />
					moderate in food,<br />
					and resolute in vigilance -<br />
					you may rest content in the idea that this is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough ...<br />
					something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ahead?</p>

					<p class="f4">You must train yourselves to be mindful and self-possessed, -<br />
					in going out or coming back,<br />
					in looking ahead or around you,<br />
					in stretching out your arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing your robes<br />
					or carrying your bowls,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring,<br />
					in attending to nature's wants,<br />
					in walking or standing or sitting,<br />
					asleep or awake,<br />
					in speech or in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be that -<br />
					feeling you are conscientious and scrupulous,<br />
					pure in deed, word, thought, and mode of livelihood,<br />
					moderate in food,<br />
					resolute in vigilance,<br />
					and also mindful and alert -<br />
					you may rest content in the idea that this is enough,<br />
					that you have done enough,<br />
					that you have realized the recluse's ideal,<br />
					and that you have nothing still ahead of you to accomplish.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I say unto you, and rejoin, that,<br />
					in your quest for recluse-ship,<br />
					you must not fall short of the recluse's ideal,<br />
					while there is something still ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is still ahead?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who chooses him a lonely lodging -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself, after his meal,<br />
					cross-legged and with body erect,<br />
					alert in mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting appetite from him,<br />
					he lives without appetite for things of the world<br />
					and purges his heart of appetite.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him all malice,<br />
					he lives without a thought of malice,<br />
					purging himself of malice<br />
					by good-will and compassion for all that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">All torpor has he put from him;<br />
					all torpor has gone out of his life;<br />
					by clarity of vision,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					and self-possession,<br />
					he purges his heart of torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> Worry is his no longer,<br />
					for he has put worry out of his life<br />
					and his heart within is serene,<br />
					with all worry purged away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubt he has shed and outgrown;<br />
					no question arises now<br />
					as to what are right states of consciousness;<br />
					he has purged his heart of all doubt.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who borrows money to start a business, -<br />
					in which he is so successful<br />
					that he can not only wipe out the original debt<br />
					but have enough over to keep a wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviewing his success,<br />
					he would rejoice and be glad of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, it is like a man who falls sick<br />
					and becomes very ill<br />
					and in grievous pain,<br />
					taking no pleasure in his food,<br />
					and with no strength left in his body;<br />
					but who subsequently gets over his illness,<br />
					takes pleasure in his food<br />
					and regains his strength.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too, reviewing his recovery,<br />
					would rejoice and be glad of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, it is like a man who is in bonds in prison<br />
					but is subsequently set at liberty,<br />
					safe and sound<br />
					and unmulcted in estate.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too, reviewing his release from durance,<br />
					would rejoice and be glad of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, it is like a slave,<br />
					not independent<br />
					but dependent on a master,<br />
					and with no liberty to go where he liked,<br />
					who should subsequently be set free<br />
					and become his own master<br />
					with full liberty now<br />
					to go wherever he liked.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too, reviewing his gain of freedom,<br />
					would rejoice and be glad of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, it is like a rich and wealthy man<br />
					on a long journey through the wilds<br />
					who should eventually emerge safe and sound,<br />
					without loss of goods.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too, reviewing his safe passage,<br />
					would rejoice and be glad of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the selfsame way<br />
					an Almsman Views the foregoing Five Hindrances,<br />
					while they persist in him,<br />
					as tantamount to the debt,<br />
					the disease,<br />
					the prison,<br />
					the slavery,<br />
					and the journey through the wilds.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, when he has put from him those Five Hindrances,<br />
					he views them as tantamount to freedom from debt,<br />
					disease,<br />
					prison,<br />
					slavery,<br />
					and as tantamount to the traveller's bourne.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has put from him<br />
					the Five Hindrances <a id="pg195"><span class="f2 g"><b>[195]</b></span></a> which defile the heart<br />
					and weaken insight,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction bred of aloofness,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an expert bath-attendant<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					will sprinkle soap-powder on a metal slab<br />
					and knead it up<br />
					with the water which he keeps on sprinkling over it,<br />
					until the whole of the soap-powder is one mass of lather,<br />
					permeated by the lather<br />
					both in and out,<br />
					with not a trickle of moisture left; -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction bred of aloofness,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, rising above observation and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction<br />
					bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a lake<br />
					fed from below by a spring,<br />
					with no other influx of water from east<br />
					or west<br />
					or north<br />
					or south,<br />
					a lake on which the heavens should send no showers from time to time;<br />
					yet from the spring below<br />
					there would well up cool waters into the lake,<br />
					so sluicing<br />
					and drenching<br />
					and permeating<br />
					and suffusing that lake<br />
					that there is no part of that lake<br />
					which is not suffused thereby; -<br />
					in just the same way does this Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body with the zest and satisfaction<br />
					bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which js not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> Further, by shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					that satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness<br />
					bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with satisfaction,<br />
					without zest,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					by this satisfaction without zest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in a pond of lotuses,<br />
					blue<br />
					or red<br />
					or white,<br />
					some lotuses of each kind<br />
					are born and grow in the water,<br />
					never rising above the surface<br />
					but flourishing beneath it;<br />
					and these from root to tip<br />
					are so sluiced<br />
					and drenched<br />
					and permeated<br />
					and suffused<br />
					by the cool waters<br />
					that there is not a lotus,<br />
					blue<br />
					or red<br />
					or white,<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					from root to tip<br />
					by the cool waters: -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body<br />
					with satisfaction without zest,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by putting from him<br />
					both satisfaction and dissatisfaction<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so suffuse<br />
					with a heart made pure and clean<br />
					that, as he sits,<br />
					there is no single part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					by his pure and clean heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were sitting<br />
					wrapped head and all<br />
					in a garment of white,<br />
					with not a single part of his body<br />
					not wrapped in it, -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so suffuse his very body<br />
					with a heart made pure and clean<br />
					that, as he sits,<br />
					there is no single part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					by his pure and clean heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast, thus clarified and purified,<br />
					... the Almsman ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4,</a> down to)<br />
					... his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man<br />
					who had passed from his own village<br />
					to a second<br />
					and thence to a third<br />
					and finally back to his own village,<br />
					might think how in <a id="pg197"><span class="f2 g"><b>[197]</b></span></a> his absence from home<br />
					he had visited these other villages<br />
					and how in each he had stood,<br />
					sat,<br />
					spoken,<br />
					been silent; -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman call to mind his former existences ...<br />
					his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4,</a> down to)<br />
					... in states of bliss and in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if there were two houses with doors<br />
					and a man with eyes to see<br />
					were to stand between those two houses<br />
					and observe men going in and out<br />
					and passing to and fro; -<br />
					in just the same way,<br />
					with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					does the Almsman see creatures<br />
					in act of passing hence<br />
					and re-appearing elsewhere,<br />
					creatures either lowly or debonair,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					happy or unhappy;<br />
					and he is aware<br />
					that they fare according to their deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers ...<br />
					(etc, as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4,</a> down to)<br />
					... now for me there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if on the heights<br />
					there were a lake<br />
					with clear pellucid waters as of crystal,<br />
					and a man with eyes to see<br />
					should espy from the bank where he was standing<br />
					oysters and other shells,<br />
					gravel and pebbles,<br />
					together with shoals of fish swimming about<br />
					or lying up; -<br />
					just as such a man would recognize<br />
					all that was before his eyes,<br />
					in just the same manner<br />
					does the Almsman comprehend,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					... no more of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is styled<br />
					(1) recluse,<br />
					(2) brahmin,<br />
					(3) washen <i>(nahātaka)</i>,<br />
					(4) versed <i>(vedagū),</i><br />
					(5) purged <i>(sottiyo),</i><br />
					(6) noble <i>(ariya),</i> and<br />
					(7) saintly <i>(arahant)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) How does an Almsman become a recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">By excluding evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which are depraved<br />
					and tend to re-birth,<br />
					which are burthensome<br />
					and ripen unto Ill,<br />
					and which will hereafter entail birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he becomes a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) He becomes a brahmin<br />
					by precluding evil and wrong states.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> (iii) He becomes washen<br />
					by washing away evil and wrong states.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) He becomes versed<br />
					by being versed in all about evil and wrong states.</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) He becomes purged<br />
					because he is purged of evil and wrong states.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vi) He becomes noble, and<br />
					(vii) saintly,<br />
					because he keeps at bay<br />
					evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which are depraved<br />
					and tend to re-birth,<br />
					which are burthensome<br />
					and ripen unto Ill,<br />
					and which will hereafter entail birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
