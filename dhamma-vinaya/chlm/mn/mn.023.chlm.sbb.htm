					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Kumāra-Kassapa was staying in the Andha-vana,<br />
					to whom towards dawn<br />
					there came a deity of dazzling beauty,<br />
					flooding the whole woodland with radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing to one side, <a id="pg101"><span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span></a> the deity said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsman, Almsman!</p>

					<p class="f4">There's an ant-hill which smokes by day and flames up at night.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take your tool, sage,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and dig.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sage dug away<br />
					till he found a bar and cried:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here's a bar, Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the brahmin:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cast it out, sage,<br />
					and dig on.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the sage dug on,<br />
					he came on a frog.</p>

					<p class="f4">Cast it out, sage,<br />
					and dig on,<br />
					said the brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the sage dug,<br />
					he came on a passage which forked.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the brahmin:</p>

					<p class="f4">Cast it out, sage,<br />
					and dig on.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he dug on,<br />
					he came successively on -<br />
					a strainer -<br />
					a tortoise -<br />
					a cleaver -<br />
					and a joint of meat;<br />
					all of which he was successively told to cast out<br />
					and dig on.</p>

					<p class="f4">At last he came on a cobra.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sage, leave the cobra alone,<br />
					said the brahmin;<br />
					do not harm the cobra;<br />
					pay homage to the cobra.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Almsman,<br />
					take these questions to the Lord<br />
					and treasure up his explanations.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no one in the whole universe -<br />
					with all its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					with its recluses and brahmins,<br />
					and all gods and mankind -<br />
					whose interpretation of these questions<br />
					can prove convincing,<br />
					save only the Truth-finder<br />
					or a disciple of the Truth-finder<br />
					or from someone who has been told by him or them.</p>

					<p class="f4">With these words the deity vanished from sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night was at an end,<br />
					the reverend Kumāra-Kassapa came to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					sat down to one side,<br />
					there to relate the whole story<br />
					and to end with the following questions:</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the ant-hill?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the smoking by night?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the flaming by day?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who is the brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who is the sage?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his tool?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his digging?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the bar?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the frog?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the passage which forked?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the strainer?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the tortoise?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cleaver?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the joint of meat?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cobra?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">The ant-hill, Almsman,<br />
					typifies the body,<br />
					which is made up of the four elements,<br />
					starts from a mother and father,<br />
					is sustained by rice and other foods,<br />
					and is impermanent,<br />
					being subject to attrition,<br />
					abrasion,<br />
					erasion,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and dispersal.</p>

					<p class="f4">The smoking by night<br />
					is what by night a man thinks about,<br />
					and ponders on,<br />
					with reference to the day's doings.</p>

					<p class="f4">The flames by day<br />
					are what, after thinking and pondering by night,<br />
					a man executes by day,<br />
					with body, voice, or mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahmin<br />
					typifies the Truth-finder,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">The sage<br />
					is an Almsman under training.</p>

					<p class="f4">His tool<br />
					is noble wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">His digging<br />
					is perseverance in effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bar<br />
					signifies ignorance,<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The frog<br />
					is the emblem of the unrest arising from wrath,<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The passage which forked<br />
					typifies doubting,<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The strain<br />
					represents the five hindrances, -<br />
					of passion,<br />
					ill-will,<br />
					torpor,<br />
					worry,<br />
					and doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tortoise<br />
					means the five-fold grip on continuing existence -<br />
					through visible forms,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness -<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The cleaver<br />
					indicates the five pleasures of sense -<br />
					proceeding from sights,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					and touch,<br />
					all of them pleasant,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with passion and lust -<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">The joint<br />
					typifies passions delights,<br />
					which he is bidden to cast out and fling away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, the cobra<br />
					is the symbol of the Almsman<br />
					in whom the Cankers are no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Leave him alone,<br />
					harm him not,<br />
					pay him homage.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Kumāra-Kassapa rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
