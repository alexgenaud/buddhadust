					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will tell you about the attitudes<br />
					of the good man<br />
					and of the bad man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Listen and pay attention,<br />

					<p class="f4">Then to the listening Almsmen the Lord thus began:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the good man's attitude? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose a bad man has gone forth as a Pilgrim<br />
					from a family of distinction<br />

					<a id="pt38" href="../../pali/mn/mn.113.pali.bd.htm#pg38"><span class="f2">[38]</span></a> such a man is thereby<br />
