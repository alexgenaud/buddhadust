					<p class="f4">Once the Lord was staying at  <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Great Wood in the Gabled Hall,<br />
					and at the same time<br />
					the Wanderer Vaccha-gotta was resident in the Wanderers' Pleasaunce<br />
					where the White Mango stands alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Early in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord came into Vesālī for alms,<br />
					but, reflecting that it was too early yet,<br />
					<a id="pg340"><span class="f2 g"><b>[340]</b></span></a> settled to go to the Wanderers' Pleasaunce<br />
					and visit Vaccha-gotta, - as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">From some way off<br />
					the Wanderer saw the Lord coming and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sir, let the Lord be pleased to draw near;<br />
					the Lord is right welcome;<br />
					it is a very long time<br />
					since the Lord managed to come here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord be seated;<br />
					here is a seat set for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord having seated himself accordingly,<br />
					Vaccha-gotta the Wanderer <a id="pt482" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg482"><span class="f2">[482]</span></a> took a low seat for himself to one side<br />
					and thus began:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard it said that the recluse Gotama<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is allknowing and all-seeing,<br />
					with nothing outside his ken and vision,<br />
					and that he claims that,<br />
					whether he is walking or standing still,<br />
					whether he is asleep or awake,<br />
					his ken and vision stand ready,<br />
					aye ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, is this witness true,<br />
					not misrepresenting the Lord<br />
					and not mis-stating the gist of his Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">The witness, Vaccha, is not true;<br />
					it imputes to me what is false and untrue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, sir, what account ought we to give of the Lord,<br />
					so as not to misrepresent him<br />
					or misinterpret the gist of his Doctrine<br />
					or entail the censure of an orthodox expositor thereof?</p>

					<p class="f4">He would bear true witness,<br />
					neither misrepresenting me<br />
					nor misinterpreting the gist of my Doctrine<br />
					nor entailing the censure of an orthodox expositor thereof, -<br />
					who should say:</p>

					<p class="f4">The recluse Gotama has the threefold lore <i>(te-vijja)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Vaccha,<br />
					(i) as long as I please,<br />
					I can call to mind all my own past existences,<br />
					from a single one onwards,<br />
					in all their details and features,<br />
					(ii) As long as I please,<br />
					I can see - with the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the eye of man -<br />
					creatures in act to pass hence and re-appear elsewhere<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>),<br />
					(iii) By destroying the Cankers,<br />
					I have won that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					in which no Cankers are;<br />
					here and now have I entered on<br />
					and abide in this Deliverance,<br />
					which of and by myself<br />
					I have discerned and realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it would <a id="pg341"><span class="f2 g"><b>[341]</b></span></a> be a true witness, Vaccha,<br />
					to say that I have the threefold lore.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt483" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg483"><span class="f2">[483]</span></a> At this point Vaccha-gotta the Wanderer put this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any layman, Gotama,<br />
					who, without shedding the trammels of house and home,<br />
					has, at the body's dissolution,<br />
					made an end of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not one, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any layman<br />
					who, without shedding the shackles of house and home,<br />
					has, at the body's dissolution,<br />
					got to heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not one hundred,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred,<br />
					have achieved this;<br />
					there are many more laymen than that<br />
					who, without discarding the trammels of house and home,<br />
					have, at the body's dissolution,<br />
					got to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Has any Mendicant <i>(ājīvaka)</i> at death<br />
					ever made an end of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Has any Mendicant at death<br />
					got to heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Going back in memory for ninety - one aeons,<br />
					I can only recall one single Mendicant who did; -<br />
					and he preached a gospel of Karma<br />
					and the after-consequences of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">On this showing, Gotama,<br />
					that school's efficacy<br />
					is wholly impotent to get a man even to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Vaccha; it is so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the Wanderer Vaccha-gotta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
