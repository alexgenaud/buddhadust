					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he announced to the Almsmen that he would address them on the classification of sense-relations,<br />
					and proceeded to do so as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt216" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg216"><span class="f2">[216]</span></a> There are<br />
					(i) Six internal senses to be recognized;<br />
					(ii) six (sets of) external sense-objects;<br />
					(iii) six groups of consciousness;<br />
					(iv) six groups of contacts;<br />

					(viii) There are three bases of mindfulness,<br />

					and in the cultivation of which<br />
					the Noble One as Master<br />
					is worthy to teach his following,<br />
					(ix) He is called the Supreme trainer of the human heart<br />
					for disciples who are being schooled. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the summary of the classification of sense-relations.</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) The six inward senses to be recognized are<br />
					sight,<br />
					sound,<br />
					smell,<br />
					taste,<br />
					touch<br />
					and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) The six (sets of) external objects of sense are<br />
					things seen,<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched,<br />
					and menial objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) The six groups of consciousness respectively relate to the (foregoing)<br />
					things seen,<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) The six groups of contacts respectively relate <a id="pg279"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></a> to the (foregoing)<br />
					things visible,<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) The eighteen mental researches are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen with the eye a visible thing,<br />
					a man researches into the visible thing,<br />
					and this gives rise either<br />
					(a) to what is agreeable,<br />
					or (b) to what is disagreeable,<br />
					or (c) to what is neither agreeable nor disagreeable.</p>

					<p class="f4">He researches similarly<br />
					into the like three types<br />
					of things heard,<br />
					of odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					<a id="pt217" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg217"><span class="f2">[217]</span></a> things touched<br />
					and of mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there are six agreeable researches,<br />
					six disagreeable researches,<br />
					and six neutral,<br />
					making up eighteen researches in all.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vi) Of the thirty-six tracks for creatures,<br />
					six are agreeable and belong to the world,<br />
					while six are agreeable and belong to Renunciation;<br />
					six are disagreeable and belong to the world,<br />
					while six are disagreeable and belong to Renunciation;<br />
					six are indifferent and belong to the world,<br />
					while six are indifferent and belong to Renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The six worldly satisfactions are as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense of satisfaction arises either<br />
					(a) from contemplation of the fruition of things seen,<br />
					of which the sight is conscious, -<br />
					objects that are pleasant and agreeable,<br />
					grateful and pleasurable to the mind,<br />
					but bound up with things material -,<br />
					or (6) from contemplation of memories<br />
					of what is now past and gone,<br />
					vanished and ended -;<br />
					this is called worldly satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects,<br />
					making in all the six worldly satisfactions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Renunciation's six satisfactions are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense of satisfaction arises when,<br />
					on discerning the transitory nature of things seen<br />
					and their mutability instability and annihilation,<br />
					satisfaction arises from causally understanding and seeing that,<br />
					alike in the past<br />
					and in the present,<br />
					things seen are transitory,<br />
					fraught with Ill<br />
					and by nature mutable; -<br />
					this is called Renunciation's satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and <a id="pt218" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg218"><span class="f2">[218]</span></a> mental objects,<br />
					making in all the six satisfactions of Renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg280"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span></a> The six worldly dissatisfactions are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense of dissatisfaction arises either<br />
					(a) from contemplation of the absence of seen objects that are pleasant and so forth,<br />
					or (b) from contemplation of memories<br />
					of the absence of what is now past and gone,<br />
					vanished and ended; -<br />
					this is called worldly dissatisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects,<br />
					making in all the six worldly dissatisfactions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Renunciation's six dissatisfactions are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense of dissatisfaction arises when, -<br />
					on discerning the transitory nature of things seen<br />
					and their mutability impotence and annihilation,<br />
					and after causally understanding and seeing that,<br />
					alike in the past<br />
					and in the present,<br />
					things seen are transitory,<br />
					fraught with Ill<br />
					and by nature mutable -<br />
					he summons up the yearning<br />
					for the utter Deliverances in the cry:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, o when,<br />
					shall I develop and dwell<br />
					in the sphere in which the Noble Ones now are?"</p>

					<p class="f4">and, as he so yearns,<br />
					his yearning brings with it the dissatisfaction<br />
					which is called Renunciation's dissatisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects,<br />
					<a id="pt219" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg219"><span class="f2">[219]</span></a> making in all Renunciation's six dissatisfactions.</p>

					<p class="f4">The six worldly indifferences are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the indifference on seeing a thing,<br />
					which appertains to the ignorant and foolish average man,<br />
					who has not triumphed to the full,<br />
					who has not triumphed over the ripening consequences of his past,<br />
					who has not realized the perils which beset him<br />
					but is merely an uninstructed average man; -<br />
					such indifference as his<br />
					fails to transcend the thing seen,<br />
					and therefore is called worldly indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects,<br />
					making in all the six worldly indifferences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Renunciation's six indifferences are as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">A sense of indifference arises when,<br />
					on discerning the transitory nature of things seen<br />
					and their mutability instability and annihilation,<br />
					indifference arises from causally understanding and seeing that,<br />
					alike in the <a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> past and in the present,<br />
					things seen are transitory,<br />
					fraught with Ill<br />
					and by nature mutable; -<br />
					such indifference as this<br />
					transcends the thing seen,<br />
					and therefore is called Renunciation's indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same applies to<br />
					things heard,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					things touched<br />
					and mental objects,<br />
					making in all Renunciation's six indifferences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This completes the tale of the six and thirty tracks for creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt220" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg220"><span class="f2">[220]</span></a> (vii) To 'banish this by that'<br />
					means that by and through Renunciation's six satisfactions<br />
					you should banish and transcend<br />
					the six worldly satisfactions;<br />
					this is the way to banish and to transcend them.</p>

					<p class="f4">By and through Renunciation's six dissatisfactions and indifferences<br />
					you should similarly banish and transcend<br />
					the six worldly satisfactions and indifferences,<br />
					respectively.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Almsmen, there is one indifference<br />
					which is manifold and of multiplicity:<br />
					there is another indifference<br />
					which is single and of unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">The former is an indifference to (particular)<br />
					things seen<br />
					or heard,<br />
					to odours<br />
					or savours,<br />
					to things touched<br />
					or to mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter is a function of Infinite Space,<br />
					or of Infinite Mind,<br />
					or of Naught,<br />
					or of Neither-Per-ception-nor-Non-Perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">By and through unity<br />
					you should banish and transcend multiplicity;<br />
					this is the way to banish<br />
					and to transcend the manifold.</p>

					<p class="f4">By and through the entire absence of all cravings<br />
					you should banish and transcend specific cravings,<br />
					in the indifference which is of unity;<br />
					this is the way to banish and to transcend them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This then <a id="pt221" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg221"><span class="f2">[221]</span></a> is the meaning of 'banish this by that'</p>

					<p class="f4">(viii)	There are three bases of mindfulness,<br />
					which the Noble One cultivates<br />
					and in the cultivation of which<br />
					the Noble One as Master<br />
					is worthy to teach his following.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a compassionate and loving spirit<br />
					and out of Compassion<br />
					a master expounds his Doctrine to his disciples,<br />
					telling them it will make for their good and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Three things may happen. In the first case,)<br />
					his disciples neither pay attention<br />
					nor give ear<br />
					<a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> nor set themselves to learn<br />
					but flout their master's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such case the Truth-finder rejoices not,<br />
					nor experiences rejoicing,<br />
					but remains unperturbed,<br />
					still mindful and alive to everything. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first basis of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, if, on his expounding the Doctrine for their behoof,<br />
					(only) some of his disciples neither pay attention<br />
					nor give ear<br />
					nor set themselves to learn<br />
					but flout his teaching,<br />
					the Truth-finder neither rejoices nor does not rejoice,<br />
					experiences neither rejoicing nor its converse<br />
					but, quit of both emotions equally,<br />
					remains indifferent,<br />
					still mindful and alive to everything. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second basis of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, if, on his expounding his Doctrine for their behoof,<br />
					all his disciples pay attention,<br />
					give ear,<br />
					and set themselves to learn<br />
					without flouting his teaching,<br />
					the Truth-finder rejoices<br />
					and experiences rejoicing<br />
					but remains unperturbed,<br />
					still mindful and alive to everything. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third basis of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt222" href="../../pali/mn/mn.137.pali.bd.htm#pg222"><span class="f2">[222]</span></a> Such then are the three bases of mindfulness<br />
					which the Noble One cultivates<br />
					and in the cultivation of which<br />
					the Noble One as Master<br />
					is worthy to teach his following.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ix) He is called the Supreme Trainer of the human heart<br />
					for disciples who are being schooled.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a young elephant -<br />
					or colt -<br />
					or steer -<br />
					is being driven by its tamer,<br />
					it runs off in one of four directions, -<br />
					ahead or back or left or right;<br />
					but the human steer,<br />
					when driven by the Trutb-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					runs off in one of eight directions: -</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) Having form himself,<br />
					he sees forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">(2)Being inwardly conscious of non-form,<br />
					he sees forms externally.</p>

					<p class="f4">(3) He devotes himself to happiness alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">(4) By passing entirely beyond all consciousness of material forms<br />
					and losing all consciousness of sense-reactions,<br />
					by not heeding consciousness of multiplicity,<br />
					he comes to think of space as infinite<br />
					and so develops and dwells<br />
					in the realm of Infinite Space,<br />
					and thereafter,<br />
					successively,<br />
					in the realms of<br />
					(5) Infinity of Mind,<br />
					(6) Naught,<br />
					(7) Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception, and<br />
					(8) extinction of <a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> all feeling and consciousness. -</p>

					<p class="f4">And that is why he is called<br />
					the Supreme trainer of the human heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
