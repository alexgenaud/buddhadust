<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 14. Mahanama the Sakkyan, lamenting over his state of confusion with regard to pleasures of the senses, is given a detailed exposition of what constitutes the pleasure and the danger of the five senses, the thing that is binding Mahanama to confusion, and the way the Buddha himself escaped such confusion. The Buddha then describes an encounter with some Jains wherein he defeats their claim that the end of pain is to be got through pain by showing them that they are practicing their painful austerities without any support in knowledge or understanding and concludes with a description of the exceptional pleasure which he is able to attain." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan pleasaunce,<br />
					there came to him (his elder cousin) Mahānāma the Sakyan<br />
					who, after salutations,<br />
					seated himself to one side<br />
					and spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I have long understood the Lords teaching<br />
					that greed,<br />
					hate<br />
					and illusion<br />
					were vices that beset the heart,<br />
					yet at times each of these vices<br />
					invades my heart<br />
					and takes up its abode there,<br />
					so that I wonder<br />
					what undiscarded state of consciousness it is<br />
					that causes this invasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Mahānāma,<br />
					it is an undiscarded state of consciousness<br />
					which causes the trouble;<br />
					and this would be dislodged from within you,<br />
					if you were to quit house and home<br />
					and renounce all pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because this state of mind persists in you,<br />
					that you keep living on at home in comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, though a disciple of the Noble<br />
					has a sound and true grasp<br />
					and comprehension of the truth<br />
					that pleasures of the sense,<br />
					while yielding little satisfaction<br />
					but much Ill<br />
					and much tribulation,<br />
					are dogged by perils greater still,<br />
					he yet fails to find zest and satisfaction -<br />
					or something Higher than that -<br />
					without pleasures of sense<br />
					and without wrong states of consciousness, -<br />
					then he is in pleasure's snares.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if to that grasp<br />
					and comprehension<br />
					he adds this zest and satisfaction -<br />
					or something Higher -<br />
					without pleasures of sense<br />
					and without wrong states,<br />
					then he is not ensnared by pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself, Mahānāma,<br />
					in the days before my Enlightenment,<br />
					when I was still but a Bodhisatta<br />
					not yet fully enlightened,<br />
					although I had a sound and true grasp<br />
					and comprehension of the truth<br />
					about pleasures of <a id="pg67"><span class="f2 g"><b>[67]</b></span></a> sense,<br />
					yet I failed to find zest and satisfaction,<br />
					or something Higher,<br />
					without pleasures of sense<br />
					and wrong dispositions;<br />
					and I was conscious<br />
					that I was still in pleasure's snares.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when to grasp and comprehension<br />
					I added a zest and satisfaction,<br />
					and something Higher,<br />
					into which pleasure<br />
					and wrong dispositions<br />
					did not enter,<br />
					then I became conscious<br />
					of being no longer ensnared by pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction<br />
					that attends pleasures of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">Fivefold ...<br />
					(etc. as in <a href="mn.013.chlm.sbb.htm">preceding Sutta</a>) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Verily with pleasure,<br />
					and pleasure only,<br />
					as the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time,<br />
					when I was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					on the Vultures' Peak,<br />
					there were a number of Nigaṇṭhas at Blackrock<br />
					on the slopes of Mt. Isigili, -<br />
					upright men who would never sit down,<br />
					and were undergoing paroxysms of acute pain and agony.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arising towards evening from my meditations,<br />
					I went to Blackrock<br />
					and asked those Nigaṇṭhas why it was<br />
					they subjected themselves to all these pains<br />
					by maintaining the upright posture<br />
					and never sitting down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their answer to me was that Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha -<br />
					who was all-knowing and all-seeing,<br />
					with nothing beyond his ken and vision,<br />
					and who claimed that,<br />
					whether he was walking or standing still,<br />
					sleeping or awake,<br />
					continuous and unruffled ken and vision<br />
					were always his<br />
					had taught them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nigaṇṭhas,<br />
					you have done evil in the past; -<br />
					extirpate it by these severe austerities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Every present restraint on body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and mind<br />
					will hereafter undo the evildoings of the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence, by expelling through penance<br />
					all past misdeeds,<br />
					and by not committing fresh misdeeds,<br />
					the future becomes cleared;<br />
					with the future cleared,<br />
					the past is wiped out;<br />
					with the past wiped out,<br />
					Ill is no more;<br />
					with Ill no more,<br />
					(painful) feelings are no more;<br />
					and, with painful feelings now no more,<br />
					all Ill will be outworn."</p>

					<p class="f4">'This teaching commends and approves itself to us,<br />
					and we rejoice in it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, I said to those Nigaṇṭhas:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you know, reverend sirs,<br />
					whether you had an existence before this<br />
					and were not non-existent?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg68"><span class="f2 g"><b>[68]</b></span></a> 'No, sir.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you know that,<br />
					in a former existence,<br />
					you were guilty,<br />
					and not guiltless,<br />
					of misdeeds?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you know that<br />
					(in that former existence)<br />
					you were guilty,<br />
					and not guiltless,<br />
					of this or that specific misdeed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you know that a precise amount of Ill<br />
					has already been outworn,<br />
					or that a precise amount of Ill<br />
					has to be outworn,<br />
					or that, when a precise amount of Ill has been outworn,<br />
					all Ill has become outworn?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do you know how,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					to shed wrong dispositions<br />
					and to acquire right dispositions?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'So I gather, sirs,<br />
					that you Nigaṇṭhas have no knowledge<br />
					whether you had an existence before this;<br />
					whether you were guilty of misdeeds,<br />
					either generally or specifically;<br />
					how much Ill is already outworn<br />
					or how much has still to be outworn<br />
					or how much has to be outworn<br />
					before all Ill has become outworn;<br />
					nor how, here and now,<br />
					to shed wrong dispositions<br />
					and to acquire right dispositions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so, pray,<br />
					do those who,<br />
					having been reborn as men,<br />
					are hunters<br />
					or have hands stained with blood or cruelty,<br />
					flock to be Pilgrims with the Nigaṇṭhas?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'True weal, Gotama,<br />
					must be won<br />
					not by weal and comfort<br />
					but by woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">If weal were the means to win weal,<br />
					then the King of Magadha, Seniya Bimbisara,<br />
					would win weal,<br />
					for there is more weal in his life<br />
					than in the reverend Gotama's.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely this is a somewhat hasty remark.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I who ought to be asked<br />
					which of the two of us<br />
					enjoys the greater weal, -<br />
					the King or I.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, it was somewhat hasty;<br />
					but let that pass,<br />
					and let us now put to you the question<br />
					whether it is the King or you<br />
					who enjoys the greater weal in his life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, sirs, I will ask you a question in return,<br />
					to be answered by you as you see fit:</p>

					<p class="f4">Can the King <a id="pg69"><span class="f2 g"><b>[69]</b></span></a> rest motionless<br />
					and not utter a word<br />
					for seven days and nights on end,<br />
					and yet abide in Weal beyond compare?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Can he do so for six days and nights, -<br />
					or for five,<br />
					four,<br />
					three,<br />
					two days and nights,<br />
					or for just one single night and day?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, sirs, I can rest motionless<br />
					and not speak a word<br />
					for a night and a day<br />
					and yet abide all the time<br />
					in Weal beyond compare.</p>

					<p class="f4">I can do so for two nights and days, -<br />
					for three,<br />
					four,<br />
					five,<br />
					six and seven nights and days on end.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Nigaṇṭhas?</p>

					<p class="f4">On this shewing,<br />
					who enjoys the greater Weal in his life,<br />
					King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha, or I?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'On this showing,<br />
					it is the reverend  Gotama<br />
					who enjoys greater Weal in his life<br />
					than the King does.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So spoke the Lord. Glad at heart,<br />
					Mahānāma the Sakyan rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
