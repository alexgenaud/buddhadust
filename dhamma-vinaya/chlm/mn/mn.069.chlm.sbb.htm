					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels are fed,<br />
					there appeared among the Confraternity<br />
					on some business or other<br />
					an uncouth Almsman from the wilds, named Gulissani,<br />
					concerning whom the reverend Sāriputta held forth to the Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman who comes in<br />
					from the wilds to the Confraternity<br />
					and lives with them<br />
					should show respect and consideration to his fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he does not,<br />
					there will be talk<br />
					of what to do with his reverence from the wilds,<br />
					who has lived alone in his wilds<br />
					and done what he liked there,<br />
					and shows no respect <a id="pg333"><span class="f2 g"><b>[333]</b></span></a> or consideration here<br />
					for his fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what will be said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And therefore an Almsman from the wilds,<br />
					when he comes in to the Confraternity<br />
					and lives with them,<br />
					should show respect and consideration to his fellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman from the wilds<br />
					should be correct in the matter of seats,<br />
					punctilious neither to displace seniors<br />
					nor to oust juniors.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he shows himself the reverse,<br />
					there will be talk of what to do<br />
					with this Almsman from the wilds<br />
					who is deficient even in the common decencies<br />
					which the Doctrine prescribes.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what will be said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And therefore an Almsman from the wilds<br />
					when he comes in to the Confraternity<br />
					and lives with them,<br />
					should be correct in the matter of seats.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, and for the like reasons,<br />
					an Almsman from the wilds<br />
					should not visit the village for alms<br />
					at too early an hour,<br />
					nor return ahead of the others;<br />
					he ought not to call on families <a id="pt470" href="../../pali/mn/mn.069.pali.bd.htm#pg470"><span class="f2">[470]</span></a> either before<br />
					or after the midday meal;<br />
					he ought to be composed and sedate;<br />
					he ought to be reserved and not loquacious;<br />
					he ought to be pleasant spoken and amiable;<br />
					he ought to keep watch and ward over his faculties;<br />
					<a id="pt471" href="../../pali/mn/mn.069.pali.bd.htm#pg471"><span class="f2">[471]</span></a> he should be moderate in his eating,<br />
					ever vigilant,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					stedfast,<br />
					and profound in goodwill;<br />
					<a id="pt472" href="../../pali/mn/mn.069.pali.bd.htm#pg472"><span class="f2">[472]</span></a> he should be a zealous student<br />
					of the higher branches of the Doctrine and the Law.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will be asked questions thereon,<br />
					and if he can find nothing to say,<br />
					there will be talk of what is to be done<br />
					with this Almsman from the wilds,<br />
					where he lived alone and did what he pleased,<br />
					who, on being asked questions about the higher branches of the Doctrine and the Law,<br />
					can find nothing to say.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what will be said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And therefore an Almsman from the wilds<br />
					ought to be a zealous student<br />
					of the higher branches of the Doctrine and the Law.</p>

					<p class="f4">For like reasons,<br />
					he ought to be a zealous student too<br />
					both of those excellent Deliverances<br />
					which transcend the visible<br />
					and are incorporeal,<br />
					and also of transcendental states of consciousness,<br />
					lest it be said of <a id="pg334"><span class="f2 g"><b>[334]</b></span></a>  him<br />
					that he knows nothing of that<br />
					for which he became a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the reverend Mahā-Mogallāna asked the reverend Sāriputta<br />
					whether these states of consciousness<br />
					were incumbent only on an Almsman from the wilds<br />
					or <a id="pt473" href="../../pali/mn/mn.069.pali.bd.htm#pg473"><span class="f2">[473]</span></a> whether they were the business also<br />
					of an Almsman from the confines of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are incumbent on the Almsman from the wilds, sir,<br />
					and still more are they the business of an Almsman<br />
					from the confines of a village.</p>
