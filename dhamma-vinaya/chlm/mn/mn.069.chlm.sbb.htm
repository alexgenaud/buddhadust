					<p class="f4">And on that occasion a monk named Golissāni,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> a wilderness-dweller of crude behavior, had entered into the midst of the Saṅgha on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, with reference to the monk named Golissāni, addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, when a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, it should be with respect and with deference toward his fellows in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a wilderness-dwelling monk, coming into the Saṅgha and living in the Saṅgha, is not respectful or deferential toward his fellows in the holy life, there are those who would say of him, 'What good has it done for this venerable wilderness-dweller to be alone in the wilderness, living independently, when he is not respectful or deferential toward his fellows in the holy life?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because there are those who would say that of him, when a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, it should be with respect and with deference toward his fellows in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should be skilled with regard to seats, (thinking,) 'I will sit without encroaching on the elder monks, and not preempting the new monks from a seat.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If a wilderness-dwelling monk, coming into the Saṅgha and living in the Saṅgha, is not skilled with regard to seats, there are those who would say of him, 'What good has it done for this venerable wilderness-dweller to be alone in the wilderness, living independently, when he doesn't know even a point of good conduct?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Because there are those who would say that of him, when a wilderness-dwelling monk has come into the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should be skilled with regard to seats.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Mahā Moggallāna said to Ven. Sāriputta, "Sāriputta my friend, are these qualities to be undertaken and practiced only by a wilderness-dwelling monk, or also by a village-dwelling monk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Moggallāna my friend, these qualities are to be undertaken and practiced by a wilderness-dwelling monk, and even more so by a village-dwelling monk."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This is one of the protocols to be followed in the meal hall. See Cv 8:4.3</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Pācittiya 46 says: "Should any bhikkhu, being invited for a meal and without taking leave of an available bhikkhu, go calling on families before or after the meal, except at the proper occasions, it is to be confessed. Here the proper occasions are these: a time of giving cloth, a time of making robes. These are the proper occasions here."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> These are the formless levels of concentration, beginning with the dimension of the infinitude of space. The Commentary says that all eight levels of concentration attainment are included here, including the four jhānas, but the injunction for the monk to have concentration, mentioned above, would already appear to cover the four jhānas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This covers all of the transcendent attainments.</p>
