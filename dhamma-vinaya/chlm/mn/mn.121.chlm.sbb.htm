					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in the Old Pleasaunce<br />
					in the palace of Migāra's mother,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda,<br />
					rising towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					went to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Once while you were staying among the Sakyans,<br />
					in their township of Nagaraka,<br />
					I heard with my own ears<br />
					from your own lips<br />
					your remark that you were then <br />
					'living with the Void' a great deal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Did 1 rightly hear,<br />
					receive,<br />
					apprehend,<br />
					and comprehend your remark, sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, quite rightly, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days as now,<br />
					I have lived a great deal with the Void.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as this whilom palace<br />
					is emptied of elephants,<br />
					oxen,<br />
					horses<br />
					and mares,<br />
					is emptied of gold and coins of silver,<br />
					and is emptied of its male and female establishment,<br />
					and yet,<br />
					because of the presence of the Confraternity,<br />
					is not an empty solitude; -<br />
					just in the same way,<br />
					by ignoring ideas of village or of inhabitants,<br />
					an Almsman envisages solitude<br />
					through the idea of a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this idea his heart goes forth,<br />
					finding therein satisfaction<br />
					and a foothold and Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is clear that<br />
					the agitation which would attend ideas of a village,<br />
					or of people,<br />
					is absent in this conception,<br />
					but yet there abides some agitation<br />
					in the solitude which attends the idea of a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, he realizes that,<br />
					though his conception is emptied<br />
					of all ideas of village or inhabitants,<br />
					yet non-emptiness still persists<br />
					in the conception of solitude<br />
					which attends the idea of a forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he discerns emptiness<br />
					in what is absent therefrom<br />
					and concludes that<br />
					<a id="pt105" href="../../pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#pg105"><span class="f2">[105]</span></a> peace abides in this residuum.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is that there arises in him<br />
					a true changeless and pure conception of emptiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, by ignoring ideas<br />
					both of people and of forests,<br />
					he conceives of solitude<br />
					through the idea of earth,<br />
					to which idea his heart goes forth,<br />
					finding therein satisfaction<br />
					and a foothold and Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">By dismissing all thoughts<br />
					of earth's heights and valleys,<br />
					of its rivers and rugged ground,<br />
					and of its snags and brakes,<br />
					and towering mountains,<br />
					and by viewing earth<br />
					as a bull's hide<br />
					with a hundred pegs to stretch out flat<br />
					its unmarred and featureless expanse,<br />
					he discerns of solitude<br />
					through the idea of earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this idea<br />
					his heart goes forth,<br />
					finding therein satisfaction<br />
					and a foothold and Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He realizes that,<br />
					although he is now quit of the agitation<br />
					which attends ideas of people and of forests,<br />
					yet in this earth idea<br />
					there still survives some distress<br />
					in the solitude which accompanies that idea;<br />
					for, therein non-emptiness persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he discerns emptiness<br />
					in what is absent therefrom,<br />
					and concludes that it is in the residuum<br />
					that peace abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus too it is<br />
					that there arises in him<br />
					a true changeless and pure conception of emptiness.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(And the same happens to him with the successive ideas of Infinite Space<br />
					<a id="pt106" href="../../pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#pg106"><span class="f2">[106]</span></a>,<br />
					of Infinite Mind,<br />
					and of <a id="pt107" href="../../pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#pg107"><span class="f2">[107]</span></a> Neither-perception-nor-Non-perception.)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Dismissing in turn<br />
					all these ideas,<br />
					and envisaging solitude<br />
					through concentration of heart beyond attributes,<br />
					he finds nevertheless<br />
					that therein there still survives<br />
					some residual agitation,<br />
					namely through this body of his<br />
					with its senses<br />
					<a id="pt108" href="../../pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#pg108"><span class="f2">[108]</span></a> as a consequence of being alive;<br />
					for therein non-emptiness persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he <a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> discovers emptiness<br />
					in what is absent therefrom,<br />
					and concludes that it is in this residuum<br />
					that peace abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus too it is<br />
					that there arises in him<br />
					a true changeless and pure conception of emptiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, still envisaging solitude<br />
					through concentration of heart beyond attributes,<br />
					he realizes that even this absolute concentration of heart<br />
					is but an effect<br />
					and a mental product,<br />
					and consequently is transient<br />
					and has its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this,<br />
					his heart is delivered from the Cankers of lust,<br />
					of continuing existence<br />
					and of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					comes to him in the thought that<br />
					birth is no more,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done,<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there is no more of what he has been.</p>

					<p class="f4">He realizes that,<br />
					although he is now quit of the agitation<br />
					which attends those three Cankers respectively,<br />
					yet there still survives<br />
					some residual distress,<br />
					namely through this body of his<br />
					with its senses as a consequence of being alive;<br />
					for, therein non-emptiness persists.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he discovers emptiness<br />
					in what is absent there,<br />
					and concludes that it is in this residuum<br />
					that peace abides.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus too it is<br />
					that there arises in him<br />
					a true <a id="pt109" href="../../pali/mn/mn.121.pali.bd.htm#pg109"><span class="f2">[109]</span></a> changeless pure and ultimate conception of emptiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Ānanda;<br />
					this was the form of pure and ultimate emptiness<br />
					that all recluses and brahmins of bygone times<br />
					developed and dwelt in;<br />
					this will be the pure and ultimate emptiness<br />
					that future recluses and brahmins<br />
					will develop and dwell in;<br />
					and this is the pure and ultimate emptiness<br />
					that to-day is developed<br />
					by all those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who develop and dwell in pure and ultimate emptiness. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Ānanda,<br />
					you should train yourselves<br />
					to develop and dwell<br />
					in pure and ultimate emptiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
