					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he informed the Almsmen that he would instruct them<br />
					in the exposition and analysis<br />
					of the True Saint.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their attention gained,<br />
					the Lord spoke as follows: -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt188" href="../../pali/mn/mn.131.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a>	How, Almsmen, does a man hark back to the past? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By finding delight in remembering<br />
					that in a previous birth in the past<br />
					such and such was he like,<br />
					such and such were his feelings,<br />
					his perceptions,<br />

					<p class="f4">How does a man not hark back? -</p>

					<p class="f4">How does a man not have longings for the future? -</p>

					<p class="f4">By not finding delight in any such aspirations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed everyday man<br />

					<p class="f4">That is how a man is swept away.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is a man not swept away<br />

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an instructed disciple of the Noble Ones,<br />

					who has vision of the Excellent<br />
