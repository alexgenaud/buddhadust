					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever alarms -<br />
					whatsoever perturbations -<br />
					whatsoever desolations - arise,<br />
					all proceed from the fool,<br />
					not from the informed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as it is from the hut of bamboo<br />
					or bracken<br />
					that the fire breaks out<br />
					which consumes even storied mansions<br />
					which are cased in plaster<br />
					and keep out the wind<br />
					with doors that fit<br />
					and casements that shut, -<br />
					so it is always from the fool<br />
					and never from the informed<br />
					that there arise those alarms,<br />
					perturbations<br />
					and desolations<br />
					which are present in the fool<br />
					and absent in the informed.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, the informed have neither alarms,<br />
					nor perturbations<br />
					nor desolations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Almsmen,<br />
					train yourselves up to become informed by study.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt62" href="../../pali/mn/mn.115.pali.bd.htm#pg62"><span class="f2">[62]</span></a> At what stage, sir, asked the reverendĀnanda,<br />
					can an Almsman be rightly described<br />
					as informed by study?</p>

					<p class="f4">When, Ānanda, the Almsman has mastered<br />
					(1) the Elements,<br />
					(2) the Senses, and<br />
					(3) the Chain of Causation,<br />
					together with<br />
					(4) the rationally possible<br />
					and the rationally impossible, -<br />
					then can an Almsman be rightly described<br />
					as informed by study.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir, can he be rightly described<br />
					as having mastered the Elements?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are eighteen of these elements,<br />
					namely the sense-organ,<br />
					the object of sense,<br />
					and the sense-cognition<br />
					for each of the six senses<br />
					of sight,<br />
					hearing,<br />
					smell,<br />
					taste,<br />
					touch<br />
					and mentality.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Almsman knows and sees<br />
					these eighteen elements,<br />
					then he can rightly be described as having mastered the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can he reach this mastery in another manner?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, namely<br />
					earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					air,<br />
					fire,<br />
					space,<br />
					mentality;<br />
					and when the <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> Almsman knows and sees these six,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can he reach this mastery in yet another manner?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, namely<br />
					comfort and discomfort,<br />
					happiness and unhappiness,<br />
					poised equanimity<br />
					and ignorance;<br />
					and when the Almsman knows and sees these six,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can he reach this mastery in yet another manner?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six elements, namely<br />
					passion,<br />
					renunciation,<br />
					rancour and non-rancour,<br />
					<a id="pt68" href="../../pali/mn/mn.115.pali.bd.htm#pg68"><span class="f2">[68]</span></a> harmfulness and harmlessness;<br />
					and when the Almsman knows and sees these six,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can he reach this mastery in yet another manner?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these three elements, namely,<br />
					passion,<br />
					form and<br />
					non-form;<br />
					and when the Almsman knows and sees these three,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can he reach this mastery in yet another manner?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these two elements,<br />
					the derived and the underived;<br />
					and when the Almsman knows and sees these two,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the Elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir,<br />
					can he rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered Sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are six internal<br />
					and six external aspects of sense,<br />
					the six sense-organs<br />
					and the sense-objects of each of the six.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Almsman knows and sees<br />
					this pair of sixes,<br />
					he can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered Sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir,<br />
					can he rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the Chain of Causation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take, Ānanda, an Almsman<br />
					who knows the following: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is,<br />
					then that comes about;<br />
					if this is not,<br />
					then that does not come about;<br />
					when this is laid to rest,<br />
					then that passes to rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Factors are conditioned by ignorance,<br />
					consciousness by the factors,<br />
					Name-and-Form by consciousness,<br />
					organs of sense by Name-and-Form,<br />
					contact by sense-organs,<br />
					feelings by sense-organs,<br />
					<a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> craving by feelings,<br />
					attachment by craving,<br />
					<a id="pt64" href="../../pali/mn/mn.115.pali.bd.htm#pg64"><span class="f2">[64]</span></a> existence by attachment,<br />
					birth by existence;<br />
					and by birth come old-age and death,<br />
					with sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is how all that makes up Ill is laid to rest: -</p>

					<p class="f4">By laying ignorance to rest<br />
					with no trace of passion left behind<br />
					the factors are laid to rest,<br />
					by laying factors to rest consciousness is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying consciousness to rest Name-and-Form are laid to rest,<br />
					by laying Name-and-Form to rest the organs of sense are laid to rest,<br />
					by laying the organs of sense to rest contact is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying contact to rest feelings are laid to rest,<br />
					by laying feelings to rest craving is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying craving to rest attachment is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying attachment to rest existence is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying existence to rest birth is laid to rest,<br />
					by laying birth to rest old-age and death are laid to rest,<br />
					and therewithal disappear sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					suffering and tribulation,<br />
					so that all that makes up Ill<br />
					is laid to rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point an Almsman can rightly be described<br />
					as having mastered the Chain of Causation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir, can an Almsman be rightly described<br />
					as having mastered the rationally possible<br />
					and the rationally impossible?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take, Ānanda, an Almsman<br />
					who knows clearly as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is impossible<br />
					and out of the question<br />
					for a man of vision<br />
					to approach a factor as everlasting;<br />
					but it is possible for an ordinary man to do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />

					or his father's-life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />

					there should at one and the same time<br />

					but it is possible for a man to be any of these.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is impossible<br />
					for the fruit of bodily misconduct -<br />
					or of misconduct in speech or thought -<br />
					to be pleasant, agreeable and pleasing;<br />
					but it is possible for the fruit<br />
					to be unpleasant, disagreeable and unpleasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is possible<br />

					by reason of that cause and condition<br />
					to be reborn,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />

					<p class="f4">At this point, Ānanda,<br />
