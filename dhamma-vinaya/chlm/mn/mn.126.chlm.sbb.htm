<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 126. The Buddha explains that it is not enough to have hopes, aspirations, yearnings for freedom from pain, one must behave in a way that brings pain to and end for that to happen. He provides four similes to illustrate this point: trying to get oil by pressing sand, trying to get milk by pulling a bull's horn, trying to get butter by churning water, and trying to light a fire with a wet sappy stick." />

					<p class="f4">Once while the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the reverend Bhūmija,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went to the abode of (his nephew) Prince Jayasena<br />
					and sat down on the seat set for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him came the prince<br />
					who after greetings<br />
					took a seat to one side,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmins, Bhūmija,<br />
					who affirm and hold that,<br />
					if a man conceives longings<br />
					while leading the higher life,<br />
					he cannot win the fruits of the higher life,<br />
					nor can he<br />
					if he conceives non-longings,<br />
					or both (alternately),<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">What herein does the reverend Bhūmija's Master affirm and teach?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have never heard or received<br />
					the Lord's utterance on this<br />
					from his own lips;<br />
					but he might possibly take the following line: -</p>

					<p class="f4">It all depends on whether<br />
					with the longing or non-longing,<br />
					or neither or both,<br />
					there goes a true and causal<br />
					leading of the higher life; -<br />
					if it does not,<br />
					he can win no fruit;<br />
					if it does,<br />
					<a id="pt139" href="../../pali/mn/mn.126.pali.bd.htm#pg139"><span class="f2">[139]</span></a> he can.</p>

					<p class="f4">This might be the Lord's view;<br />
					but I never heard him say so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, Bhūmija,<br />
					if this be what your master affirms and teaches,<br />
					assuredly your master stands ahead<br />
					of all recluses and brahmins there be.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so saying, the prince entertained the reverend Bhūmija with his own dish of rice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Returning after his meal,<br />
					Bhūmija related to the Lord,<br />
					word for word,<br />
					what had passed,<br />
					asking at the end<br />
					whether he had conveyed the Lord's views without misrepresentation,<br />
					and had expounded the Doctrine's <a id="pg237"><span class="f2 g"><b>[237]</b></span></a> gist<br />
					and what flows from it,<br />
					without going wrong in his doctrinal exposition.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt140" href="../../pali/mn/mn.126.pali.bd.htm#pg140"><span class="f2">[140]</span></a> Indeed you have faithfully represented my views, Bhūmija;<br />
					and there is nothing wrong in your exposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">If recluses or brahmins<br />
					have a wrong outlook<br />
					and are wrong in thoughts words and deeds, -<br />
					wrong in their mode of livelihood,<br />
					wrong in their endeavour,<br />
					in their mindfulness<br />
					and in their concentration, -<br />
					then, if, while leading the higher life,<br />
					they conceive a longing -<br />
					or a non-longing -<br />
					or both (alternately) -<br />
					or neither, -<br />
					they cannot win the fruits of that higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is no source from which fruit-winning can come.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					hunting about for oil,<br />
					in his need and quest of oil,<br />
					who should heap up sand in a trough<br />
					and crush it up thoroughly with water,<br />
					yet for all his pains<br />
					cannot get oil therefrom, -<br />
					whatever may be his longing,<br />
					or non-longing,<br />
					or both,<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is no source from which oil can be got.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man hunting about for milk,<br />
					in his need and quest of milk,<br />
					who should milk a young cow<br />
					from her horn,<br />
					yet for all his pains<br />

					whatever may be his longing,<br />
					or non-longing,<br />
					or both,<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, if, Bhūmija,<br />
					these four illustrations had occurred to you for Prince Jayasena,<br />
					straightaway he would have been converted<br />
					and, being converted,<br />
					would have acted accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, sir, could these illustrations occur to my mind for the prince,<br />

					seeing that they are spontaneous<br />
					and never before heard by man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Bhūmija rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
