In this sutta the Buddha outlines various views about the nature of the real, essential self and the world, past, future and present and points out that these views are all speculative and that for true satisfaction and liberation one must let go of all that which has been constructed, including speculative opinions." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen as follows:-</p>

					<p class="f4">Some recluses and brahmins there are who,<br />
					busying themselves about ages to come and theorizing about the future,<br />
					have advanced a variety of assertions about futurity,<br />
					(i) Some assert that the Self is conscious and hale after death,<br />
					(ii) Some assert that it,<br />
					though hale,<br />
					is unconscious after death,<br />
					(iii) Some assert that,<br />
					though hale,<br />
					it is neither conscious nor uncon- <a id="pg229"><span class="f2 g"><b>[229]</b></span></a> scious after death,<br />
					(iv) Or they affirm the break-up,<br />
					destruction and annihilation of the existent creature,<br />
					(v) Some again assert Nirvana here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus either (a) they affirm a Self after death;<br />
					or (b) they affirm the break-up,<br />
					destruction and annihilation of the existent creature;<br />
					or (c) they affirm Nirvana here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what were five theories become three,<br />
					and what were three become five.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the 'Five and Three' proposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, Almsmen, those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who assert that the Self is conscious <a id="pt229" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg229"><span class="f2">[229]</span></a> and hale after death,<br />
					affirm either that this conscious self has visible shape,<br />
					or that it has no visible shape,<br />
					or that it has both,<br />
					or that it has neither;<br />
					they affirm that its consciousness<br />
					is either unimodal or multimodal,<br />
					either limited or boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else they assert an intellection<br />
					- boundless and permanent -<br />
					which goes far beyond all this.</p>

					<p class="f4">With each and every one<br />
					of these various theories about consciousness after death<br />
					the Truth-finder is familiar,<br />
					as he is familiar too<br />
					with what some assert to stand out<br />
					as the pure and paramount,<br />
					chief and utter,<br />
					form of consciousness -<br />
					<a id="pt280" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg280"><span class="f2">[280]</span></a> whether with or without form,<br />
					whether unimodal or multimodal -,<br />
					namely,<br />
					the Realm of Naught,<br />
					boundless and permanent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we come to those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who affirm an unconscious but hale Self after death -<br />
					with or without form,<br />
					or with both or with neither -,<br />
					here some exponents of the conscious Self after death<br />
					are shocked to hear<br />
					that consciousness is a disease,<br />
					a pustulence,<br />
					a pang<br />
					and that unconsciousness alone<br />
					is good and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder knows<br />
					that these several assertions of a hale but unconscious Self after death<br />
					are impossible in themselves;<br />
					no recluse or brahmin can possibly pretend<br />
					to explain either a return hither<br />
					or a going hence,<br />
					departure from one existence<br />
					<a id="pg133"><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></a> and reappearance in another,<br />
					or growth increase and development, -<br />
					apart from all form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we come to those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who affirm a hale Self<br />
					with neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness after death -<br />
					with or without form,<br />
					or with both or with neither -,<br />
					here some exponents of the unconscious Self after death<br />
					are shocked to hear<br />
					not only that consciousness is a disease,<br />
					a pustulence,<br />
					a pang,<br />
					but also that unconsciousness is a delusion<br />
					and a snare,<br />
					and that only Neither-consciousness-nor-un-consciousness is good and excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">With each and every one of these various theories<br />
					of the hale Self that is neither-conscious-nor-unconscious after death,<br />
					the Truth-finder is familiar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If recluses and brahmins affirm<br />
					that this stage can be attained<br />
					by mere components of sight hearing and thought,<br />
					it is recognized as fatal to its attainment;<br />
					<a id="pt232" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg232"><span class="f2">[232]</span></a> for this is a stage<br />
					which is recognized as attainable<br />
					not by stages of rapt meditation<br />
					in which such components are present<br />
					but by stages where they are absent and gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When we come to those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who affirm the break-up and destruction<br />
					and annihilation of the existent creature,<br />
					apostles alike of consciousness,<br />
					of unconsciousness<br />
					and of neither-consciousness-nor-unconsciousness after death<br />
					are all shocked together,<br />
					- because the other good people<br />
					loudly assert their craving for existence<br />
					by insisting again and again<br />
					on the hereafter in store for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a huckster<br />
					in the course of trade<br />
					reckons that he will make so much out of this<br />
					and get so much by that, -<br />
					just in the same way<br />
					these recluses and brahmins, methinks,<br />
					show up like hucksters,<br />
					with their reiterated insistence<br />
					on the hereafter in store for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder knows that,<br />
					for all their dread and loathing of personality,<br />
					these believers in annihilation<br />
					still keep circling and revolving round this selfsame personality -<br />
					just as a dog,<br />
					tied by a strap to a stout pillar or post,<br />
					<a id="pt233" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg233"><span class="f2">[233]</span></a> runs in circles round <a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> and round that selfsame pillar or post.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards all recluses or brahmins who,<br />
					busying themselves with the ages to come<br />
					and theorizing about the future,<br />
					advance a variety of assertions about futurity,<br />
					all of them<br />
					without exception<br />
					posit these five stages or one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Other recluses and brahmins there are<br />
					who, busying themselves with past ages<br />
					and theorizing about the past,<br />
					advance a variety of assertions about the past, -<br />
					each maintaining that naught but his assertion is true,<br />
					all else being empty and vain.</p>

					<p class="f4">They severally assert that<br />
					(i) Self and the world are eternal,<br />
					(ii) are not eternal,<br />
					(iii) are both eternal and not eternal,<br />
					(iv) are neither eternal nor not-eternal,<br />
					(v) have an appointed end,<br />
					(vi) are endless,<br />
					(vii) have an end and are endless,<br />
					(viii) neither end nor are endless,<br />
					(ix) have unimodal consciousness,<br />
					(x) have multimodal consciousness,<br />
					(xi) have restricted consciousness,<br />
					(xii) have boundless consciousness,<br />
					(xiii) are very pleasant,<br />
					(xiv) are very unpleasant,<br />
					<a id="pt284" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg284"><span class="f2">[284]</span></a> (xv) are both pleasant and unpleasant, or<br />
					(xvi) are neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each maintains his own assertions as the sole truth,<br />
					all else being scouted as empty and vain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, to begin with those<br />
					who assert that Self and the world are eternal,<br />
					it is impossible that,<br />
					without faith,<br />
					inclination,<br />
					authority,<br />
					appreciation<br />
					and intellectual enthusiasm,<br />
					clean and pure and true vision<br />
					should individually emerge purified and cleansed;<br />
					and if there be no purified and cleansed vision for an individual,<br />
					then it is only a fraction of true vision<br />
					which these recluses and brahmins do purify,<br />
					and that is pronounced<br />
					(not true vision but)<br />
					a mere aspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same holds good of the other views, - that Self and the world are not eternal,<br />
					are both eternal and not eternal,<br />
					are neither eternal nor not-eternal,<br />
					have an appointed end,<br />
					are endless,<br />
					have an end and are endless,<br />
					neither end nor are endless,<br />
					have unimodal consciousness,<br />
					have multimodal consciousness,<br />
					have restricted consciousness,<br />
					have boundless consciousness,<br />
					are very pleasant,<br />
					are very unpleasant,<br />
					are both pleasant and unpleasant, or<br />
					are neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt235" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg235"><span class="f2">[235]</span></a> Now we will take a recluse or a brahmin<br />
					who - quit of all views about past and future,<br />
					and unbiassed by the bondage of pleasures of sense -<br />
					develops and enters on the joy of solitude,<br />
					feeling it <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> to be excellent and good.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this joy of solitude dies away,<br />
					distress arises;<br />
					when distress dies away,<br />
					there arises the joy of solitude once again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as shade passes off<br />
					and leaves the place to the blazing heat,<br />
					or as the blazing heat passes off<br />
					and leaves it in the shade,<br />
					so when the joy of solitude dies away,<br />
					distress arises,<br />
					and when distress dies away<br />
					the joy of solitude arises once again;<br />
					and the Truth-finder knows well<br />
					the ebb and flow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next we take another recluse or brahmin<br />
					who - quit of all views about past and future,<br />
					unbiassed by the bondage of pleasures of sense,<br />
					and passing beyond solitude's joys -<br />
					develops and dwells in bliss immaterial,<br />
					feeling this to be excellent and good.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this immaterial bliss dies away,<br />
					solitude's joys arise;<br />
					when they die away,<br />
					<a id="pt236" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg236"><span class="f2">[236]</span></a> there arises the immaterial bliss once more, -<br />
					again like the alternation of shade and blazing heat;<br />
					and the Truth-finder knows well<br />
					the ebb and flow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, take another recluse or brahmin<br />
					who - quit of all views about past and future,<br />
					unbiassed by the bondage of pleasures of sense,<br />
					passing beyond solitude's joys<br />
					and bliss immaterial -<br />
					develops and dwells in the poise<br />
					which knows neither pleasure nor pain,<br />
					and feels this to be excellent and good.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this poise dies away,<br />
					immaterial bliss arises;<br />
					when this bliss dies away,<br />
					poise arises once more, -<br />
					again like the alternation of shade and blazing heat;<br />
					and the Truth-finder knows well<br />
					<a id="pt237" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg237"><span class="f2">[237]</span></a> the ebb and flow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, we come to another recluse or brahmin<br />
					who - quit of all views about past or future,<br />
					unbiassed by the bondage of pleasures of sense,<br />
					passing alike beyond solitude's joys,<br />
					immaterial bliss<br />
					and the poise that knows neither pleasure nor pain -<br />
					comes to the vision that he has found Peace,<br />
					is dead to the world<br />
					and grasps at nothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing well what his vision is,<br />
					the Truth-finder observes<br />
					that this reverend Almsman <a id="pg136"><span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span></a> conceives<br />
					that Nirvana is only a salutary path to tread;<br />
					he grasps either at views about the past or the future,<br />
					or at bondage to pleasures of sense,<br />
					or at the joys of solitude,<br />
					or at immaterial bliss,<br />
					or at the poise that knows neither pleasure nor pain;<br />
					and that, though he thinks he has found Peace,<br />
					and is dead to the world,<br />
					and grasps at nothing,<br />
					yet grasping is alive within him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing that all this is composite and material,<br />
					and that components can in very truth be laid to rest,<br />
					the Truth-finder discerns an escape from the composite<br />
					and leaves it all behind.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is into the perfect way of utter Peace<br />
					that the Truth-finder has won full Enlightenment,<br />
					to wit into the Deliverance<br />
					that knows no grasping<br />
					and has thought out the true nature<br />
					of the rise,<br />
					the fall,<br />
					the satisfactions,<br />
					the perils and<br />
					the outcome of the six organs of sense;<br />
					this is the Truth-finder's perfect way of utter Peace<br />
					<a id="pt288" href="../../pali/mn/mn.102.pali.bd.htm#pg288"><span class="f2">[288]</span></a> and his Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
