					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Kusinārā<br />
					in the Sacrificial Wood,<br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think ye of me, Brethren?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is it to get robes or alms,<br />
					is it to get lodging<br />
					or to secure some future<br />
					or other hereafter<br />
					that the recluse Gotama preaches his Doctrine?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					it is not for such reasons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you think it is not for that,<br />
					what is it you think of me?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What we think, sir,<br />
					is that the Lord is compassionate<br />
					and merciful<br />
					and that it is out of compassion that -<br />
					preaches his Doctrine.</p>

							<p>Indriya and bala. Indriya here (as 'The Five') does not refer to the senses. Indriya and bala are two groups with identical sub-headings (faith, energy, minding, serenity and wisdom) where as 'Indriyas' they are external forces, and as 'bala' they are subjective powers. - see: <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/05_mv/sn05.48.043.wood.pts.htm">SN.5.48.43</a></p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, Almsmen,<br />
					you must school yourselves<br />
					in the higher lore which I have taught you,<br />
					to wit the four Themes <i>(sati-paṭṭhāna)</i>,<br />
					the four Bases of psychic power <i>(iddhi-pāda),</i><br />

					and the Noble Eightfold Path.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this higher lore<br />
					you must school yourselves<br />
					in unity and harmony<br />
					without strife.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">So schooling yourselves,<br />
					you may find two Almsmen<br />
					maintaining divergent views on the Abhidhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the first case,<br />
					if you find the two differing<br />
					both as to the meaning<br />
					and as to the letter,<br />
					first send for the Almsman of the one faction<br />
					whom you deem the more amenable<br />
					and tell him what is the rightful view<br />
					on the points at issue,<br />
					bidding him not to stir up strife.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next send for that Almsman of the opposing faction<br />
					whom you deem the more amenable<br />
					and tell him what is the rightful view<br />
					on the points at issue,<br />
					begging him not to stir up strife.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereby what is erroneously held<br />
					is to be recognized as erroneous;<br />
					and the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					are to be duly set forth accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Proceed likewise<br />
					if the divergence is confined<br />
					either to the meaning<br />
					or <a id="pt240" href="../../pali/mn/mn.103.pali.bd.htm#pg240"><span class="f2">[240]</span></a> to the letter,<br />
					or if there be really no divergence at all<br />
					but real agreement between both sides<br />
					on both aspects.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereby what is erroneously held<br />
					is to be recognized as erroneous,<br />
					where it is erroneous;<br />
					and what is correctly held<br />
					is to be recognized as being correct,<br />
					where it is correct;<br />
					<a id="pt241" href="../../pali/mn/mn.103.pali.bd.htm#pg241"><span class="f2">[241]</span></a> and the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					are to be duly set forth,<br />
					with these recognitions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Also, as thus you school yourselves<br />
					in unity and harmony without strife,<br />
					an Almsman may be guilty<br />
					of an offence or a transgression.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In such case be in no hurry to reprove; -<br />
					the individual must be studied.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In one case you may conclude<br />
					that it will neither harass you<br />
					nor annoy him, -<br />
					inasmuch as he is not a man<br />
					of wrath and nasty temper,<br />
					nor is he dense,<br />
					but easy to convince;<br />
					and you see your way<br />
					to make him grow out of wrong things<br />
					and to establish him in the right;<br />
					-if such be your conclusion,<br />
					it is proper to speak out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In another case,<br />
					if you conclude that it will not harass you<br />
					but will annoy him; -<br />
					inasmuch as he is a man<br />
					of wrath and nasty temper,<br />
					and is dense<br />
					and hard to convert;<br />
					but you see your way<br />
					to make him grow out <a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> of wrong things<br />
					and to establish him in the right,<br />
					then his annoyance is a small matter; -<br />
					it is a much greater matter<br />
					to convert him from wrong to right.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If such be your conclusion,<br />
					it is proper to speak out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In a third case,<br />
					if you conclude that it will harass you<br />
					but not annoy him, -<br />
					inasmuch as he is not a man<br />
					of wrath and nasty temper,<br />
					nor is he dense,<br />
					but hard to convert;<br />
					yet you see your way<br />
					to make him grow out of wrong things<br />
					and to establish him in the right;<br />
					your being harassed is a small matter; -<br />
					it is a much greater matter<br />
					to convert him from wrong to right.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If such be your conclusion,<br />
					it is proper to speak out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In yet another case,<br />
					if you conclude that it will both harass you<br />
					and annoy him, -<br />
					inasmuch as <a id="pt242" href="../../pali/mn/mn.103.pali.bd.htm#pg242"><span class="f2">[242]</span></a> he is a man<br />
					of wrath and bad temper,<br />
					both dense<br />
					and hard to convert;<br />
					yet you see your way<br />
					to make him grow out of wrong things<br />
					and to establish him in the right;<br />
					your being harassed<br />
					and his being annoyed<br />
					are small matters; -<br />
					it is a much greater matter<br />
					to convert him from wrong to right.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If such be your conclusion,<br />
					it is proper to speak out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In a final case,<br />
					if you conclude that it will both harass you<br />
					and annoy him, -<br />
					inasmuch as he is a man<br />
					of wrath and nasty temper,<br />
					dense<br />
					and hard to convert;<br />
					and you cannot see your way<br />
					to convert him from wrong to right; -<br />
					with such a man<br />
					you must not be careless<br />
					of your own poise of mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Herein, as you school yourselves<br />
					in unity and harmony without strife,<br />
					there may arise among you<br />
					trends of converse,<br />
					aberrations of view,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					heartburnings,<br />
					and discontent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In such a case,<br />
					first send for that Almsman<br />
					from the warring factions<br />
					whom you deem the more amenable,<br />
					and tell him that,<br />
					if the Master knew it,<br />
					he would condemn all this that had arisen in a united Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he answered aright,<br />
					he would answer that<br />
					the Master would condemn it all<br />
					and that, if it did not come to an end,<br />
					Nirvana could not be realized.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereafter the Almsman whom you deem most amenable in the opposite faction,<br />
					should have it put to him;<br />
					and, if he answered <a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> aright,<br />
					he too would answer<br />
					that the Master would condemn it all<br />
					and that, <a id="pt243" href="../../pali/mn/mn.103.pali.bd.htm#pg243"><span class="f2">[243]</span></a> if it did not come to an end,<br />
					Nirvana could not be realized.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If now the responsible Almsman<br />
					were asked by his fellows<br />
					whether in his hands<br />
					those Almsmen had grown out of wrong things<br />
					and been established in the right,<br />
					his best answer would be<br />
					that from the Lord he had learned the Doctrine<br />
					and taught it to those Almsmen, -<br />
					who had subsequently grown out of wrong<br />
					and had stablished themselves aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By such an answer,<br />
					he would neither vaunt himself<br />
					nor disparage others;<br />
					he sets forth the full Doctrine;<br />
					nor is there any operative utterance,<br />
					major or minor,<br />
					which excites condemnation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
