					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage among the Kosalans,<br />
					he came with a great company of Almsmen<br />
					to the brahmin <a id="pg321"><span class="f2 g"><b>[321]</b></span></a> village of Nagara-Vinda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Tidings reached the brahmin heads of houses in Nagara-Vinda that,<br />
					in the course of his alms-pilgrimage through Kosala,<br />
					the recluse Gotama of the Sakyan clan,<br />
					who had gone forth from a Sakyan family as a Pilgrim,<br />
					had arrived with a large train of Almsmen<br />
					<a id="pt291" href="../../pali/mn/mn.150.pali.bd.htm#pg291"><span class="f2">[291]</span></a> in Nagara-Vinda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It came to the ears of the brahmin heads of families in Sālā<br />
					that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					a Sakyan who had gone forth as a Pilgrim from a Sakyan family,<br />
					had come to their village<br />
					in the course of an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala,<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, they heard,<br />
					was the high repute noised abroad concerning the reverend Gotama<br />
					that he was said to be -<br />
					The Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind -,<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches a Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good to go and visit Arahats like him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the brahmins of Nagara-Vinda went to the Lord and,<br />
					after exchanging with him the friendly greetings of courtesy and civility,<br />
					took their seats to one side, -<br />
					some after salutations,<br />
					some after greetings,<br />
					some with palms conjoined in salutation,<br />
					some with mention of their name and surnames,<br />
					and others again in silence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To them so seated,<br />
					the Lord spoke as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, sirs, Wanderers of other schools<br />
					were to ask you what types of recluses and brahmins<br />
					ought not to receive honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship,<br />
					you should make answer to them that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion and worship ought not to be shown<br />
					to recluses and brahmins who,<br />
					in connection with visible forms<br />
					and the sense-objects of the other five senses,<br />
					have not shed all lust,<br />
					all hate<br />
					and all folly,<br />
					and, having hearts not yet tranquil,<br />
					walk sometimes righteously<br />
					but sometimes unrighteously<br />
					in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, you will say,<br />
					we ourselves too behave just the same,<br />
					and fail to see<br />
					a higher righteousness in these men;<br />
					and therefore we ought not to show such recluses and brahmins<br />
					honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt292" href="../../pali/mn/mn.150.pali.bd.htm#pg292"><span class="f2">[292]</span></a> This should be your answer to this enquiry<br />
					from Wanderers of other schools.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if Wanderers of other schools<br />
					ask you what types of recluses and brahmins<br />
					ought to receive honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship,<br />
					you should make answer to them that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship<br />
					ought to be shown to those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who, in connection with visible forms<br />
					and the sense objects of the other five senses,<br />
					have shed all lust,<br />
					all hate<br />
					and all folly,<br />
					and, with tranquil hearts,<br />
					walk always righteously in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and <a id="pg322"><span class="f2 g"><b>[322]</b></span></a> mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, you will say,<br />
					we ourselves have not shed all this<br />
					lust, hate and folly, but,<br />
					having hearts not yet tranquil,<br />
					walk sometimes righteously<br />
					and sometimes unrighteously<br />
					in body,<br />
					speech<br />
					and mind;<br />
					but we see a higher righteousness<br />
					in these recluses and brahmins;<br />
					and therefore we ought to show them<br />
					honour,<br />
					reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This should be your answer<br />
					to this enquiry from Wanderers of other schools.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If Wanderers of other schools<br />
					ask you what attributes and results<br />
					in such recluses and brahmins<br />
					lead you to say that they are<br />
					<a id="pt298" href="../../pali/mn/mn.150.pali.bd.htm#pg298"><span class="f2">[298]</span></a> either void of passion<br />
					and triumphant over passion,<br />
					or void of hate<br />
					and triumphant over hate,<br />
					or void of folly<br />
					and triumphant over folly, -<br />
					then you should make answer<br />
					to these Wanderers of other schools that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These reverend men lodge in remote solitudes<br />
					where there are no forms to be seen<br />
					to excite their admiration<br />
					by familiar occurrence;<br />
					nor sounds,<br />
					nor odours,<br />
					nor savours,<br />
					nor things to touch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such are the attributes and results in their reverences<br />
					which lead us to say<br />
					they are void of passion or hate or folly<br />
					or triumphant over them. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This should be your answer<br />
					to this enquiry from Wanderers of other schools.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the close,<br />
					the brahmins of Nagara-Vinda said to the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, Gotama, excellent!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness so that those with eyes to see might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We come to the Lord as our refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the reverend Gotama accept us<br />
					as followers who have found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life lasts.</p>
