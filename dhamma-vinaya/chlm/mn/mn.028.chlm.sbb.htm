					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta addressed the Almsmen, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sirs!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, reverend sir, said they in response.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Sāriputta spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as the foot of every creature that walks the earth<br />
					will go into the elephant's footprint,<br />
					which is pre-eminent for size, -<br />
					even so, sirs, are all right states of mind<br />
					comprised within the Four Noble Truths, -<br />
					which are the Noble Truth of Ill,<br />
					the Noble Truth of the origin of Ill,<br />
					the Noble Truth ot the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the Noble Truth of the way that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Noble Truth of Ill:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ill is birth,<br />
					Ill is decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					depression of body and of mind,<br />
					failure to get what one desires, -<br />
					together, in brief,<br />
					with all that makes up<br />
					the Five Attachments to existence, namely,<br />
					the Attachments of visible shapes,<br />
					of feeling,<br />
					of perception,<br />
					of the plastic forces,<br />
					and of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What makes up the Attachment of visible shapes?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four principal elements<br />
					(<i>i.e.</i> earth, water, fire, and air)<br />
					and whatever visible shapes are derivative therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, as to the nature of the earth-element;<br />
					it is either personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal,<br />
					it embraces everything personal<br />
					and referable to an individual<br />
					which is hard<br />
					or solid<br />
					or derived therefrom, -<br />
					such as the hair of the head or body,<br />
					nails,<br />
					teeth,<br />
					skin,<br />
					flesh,<br />
					sinews,<br />
					bones,<br />
					marrow,<br />
					kidneys,<br />
					heart,<br />
					liver,<br />
					pleura,<br />
					<a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> spleen,<br />
					lungs,<br />
					inwards,<br />
					bowels,<br />
					stomach,<br />
					faeces,<br />
					together with everything else personal<br />
					and referable to an individual<br />
					which is hard or solid<br />
					or derived therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this is called the personal earth-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external earth-element,<br />
					makes up the totality of the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard this<br />
					as it really is,<br />
					and to comprehend it aright,<br />
					is to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not mine,<br />
					This is not I,<br />
					This is no self of mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">So regarding<br />
					and so comprehending it,<br />
					a man turns from it in disgust<br />
					and loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">There comes a time<br />
					when the external water-element<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> is wroth<br />
					and the external earth-element<br />
					disappears before it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then will this external earth-element,<br />
					ancient though it be,<br />
					reveal how transient is its nature,<br />
					how subject to dissolution and decay,<br />
					how mutable!</p>

					<p class="f4">And what of this short-lived body,<br />
					bred of cravings?</p>

					<p class="f4">No 'I' is here,<br />
					no 'mine,'<br />
					no 'I am,' -<br />
					nothing at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, if others revile or defame,<br />
					assail or harry an Almsman,<br />
					he knows well that it is through his sense of hearing<br />
					that he has experienced these painful feelings,<br />
					and that they come to him as effects,<br />
					with a cause behind them, -<br />
					which cause is Contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is clear that Contact is transient.</p>

					<p class="f4">So are feelings;<br />
					so are perceptions;<br />
					so are the plastic forces;<br />
					and so is consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This relativity of the elements<br />
					attracts and satisfies him;<br />
					he takes his stand on it<br />
					and holds to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If others act harshly,<br />
					unpleasantly,<br />
					and disagreeably towards an Almsman,<br />
					if they deal him blows with fist<br />
					or clod<br />
					or cudgel<br />
					or sword,<br />
					he is clear that the nature of this body of his<br />
					is such that it is affected by such blows.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remembers<br />
					that in the Saw Homily<br />
					(<a href="mn.021.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 21</a>)<br />
					the Lord taught that,<br />
					even if villainous bandits<br />
					were to carve us limb from limb<br />
					with a two-handled saw,<br />
					even then the mind that should harbour enmity<br />
					would not be obedient to his teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">He resolves, therefore,<br />
					that indomitable and unflagging<br />
					shall his resolution be,<br />
					with a steady mindfulness<br />
					that knows no distraction,<br />
					with a tranquil body<br />
					that has found rest,<br />
					and with a stedfast heart<br />
					that never wavers; -<br />
					let them deal their blows,<br />
					if they <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> will,<br />
					with fist,<br />
					clod,<br />
					cudgel,<br />
					or sword;<br />
					the commandments of the Buddhas<br />
					are being fulfilled!</p>

					<p class="f4">If, with this present remembrance<br />
					of the Buddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					there is not strong within him<br />
					the equanimity which is founded on the right,<br />
					then is he deeply moved<br />
					and in his emotion he cries:</p>

					<p class="f4">Failure is mine,<br />
					instead of success;<br />
					I have failed<br />
					and not succeeded,<br />
					in that, with this present remembrance<br />
					of the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					equanimity is not strong within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a young wife<br />
					is deeply moved in the presence of her husband's father,<br />
					so if, with the present remembrance ...<br />
					not strong within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, with that same present remembrance<br />
					of the Buddha<br />
					and his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity,<br />
					there is strong within him<br />
					the equanimity which is founded on the right,<br />
					then he rejoices thereat.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this stage the Almsman has achieved much.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Next as to the nature of the water-element,<br />
					which may be either personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal,<br />
					it embraces everything personal<br />
					and referable to an individual<br />
					which is water<br />
					or watery<br />
					or derived therefrom, -<br />
					such as bile,<br />

					<p class="f4">But when the eye within is intact<br />

					<p class="f4">Any visible shape that appertains<br />

					<p class="f4">And what is true of visible objects,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus the Almsman recognizes that:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, the Lord has laid it down<br />

					<p class="f4">It is the Chain of Causation<br />

					<p class="f4">The origin of Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">And the cessation of Ill<br />

					<p class="f4">At this stage too the Almsman has achieved much.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> This is a correct translation. Ms. Horner notes that this is an error in the text, (i.e., <i>āpodhātu.</i> should be earth-element, <i>paṭhavīdhātu.</i>). This makes logical sense and follows the formula for the other elements, but as Bhk. Bodhi notes, it accords with Indian cosmology in which only the water, fire and wind elements destroy the world. On the othe hand, we do have earthquakes. On the other other hand, the formula for creating an earthquake by magic power is to mentally merge the image of the smallest water particle with that of the largest earth particle ... something like that, I forget exactly.</p>
