					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is with no idea of providing deer<br />
					with a crop grown solely to keep them in good condition for many a long day,<br />
					that the trapper sows his crop;<br />
					no, it is with the quite different object<br />
					that, with an infatuated inrush on the crop,<br />
					the deer will browse on the fodder,<br />
					and that, as they browse,<br />
					they will lose their heads<br />
					and thereby get off their guard,<br />
					so that being off their guard,<br />
					they can be dealt with<br />
					as he pleases amid the crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is just what a first herd of deer did,<br />
					so that they escaped not<br />
					from the trapper's mastery of craft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first herd<br />
					had met their doom,<br />
					a second herd concluded to keep quite clear of the crop<br />
					and to retire to the depths of the jungle,<br />
					leaving that fearsome pasturage untouched.</p>

					<p class="f4">This they did,<br />
					until, with the coming of the last month of the hot season,<br />
					grass and water gave out<br />
					and their bodies grew emaciated in the extreme,<br />
					so that their hearts and spirits failed them, -<br />
					and back they came<br />
					to the crop the trapper had sown.</p>

					<p class="f4">With an infatuated inrush,<br />
					they fell to browsing on the fodder,<br />
					and, as they browsed,<br />
					lost their heads<br />
					and got off their guard,<br />
					so that, being off their guard,<br />
					they could be dealt with by the trapper<br />
					as he pleased amid the crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the second herd too<br />
					escaped not from the trappers mastery of craft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first and second herds<br />
					had come to their doom,<br />
					a third herd of deer resolved <a id="pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></a> instead to take up their abode<br />
					hard by the standing crop,<br />
					but, making no mad rush in,<br />
					to browse on it with circumspection<br />
					and without losing their heads<br />
					and without getting off their guard, -<br />
					so as not to be at the trappers mercy amid the crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this they did,<br />
					thereby escaping him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the trapper and his people<br />
					thought to themselves: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This third herd is guileful and wily,<br />
					diabolically clever<br />
					and outlandish;<br />
					they graze on our crop,<br />
					but we know nothing of their comings<br />
					or of their goings;<br />
					it would be well to put high stake-nets round the whole crop,<br />
					to see if we can find out what lair they disappear to.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they staked in the whole crop all round about,<br />
					till they discovered the lair the deer disappeared to.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that is how the third herd too<br />
					escaped not from the trapper's mastery of craft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first three herds<br />
					had respectively come to their doom,<br />
					a fourth herd resolved to make their lair<br />
					where the trapper and his people could not penetrate,<br />
					and, from this security,<br />
					making no mad rush in,<br />
					to browse on the crop with circumspection<br />
					and without losing their heads<br />
					and without getting off their guard,<br />
					and so not to be at the trapper's mercy amid the crop.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this they did, thereby escaping him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the trapper and his people thought to themselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">This fourth herd is guileful and wily,<br />
					diabolically clever<br />
					and outlandish;<br />
					they graze on our crop,<br />
					but we know nothing of their comings<br />
					or of their goings;<br />
					it would be well to put high stake nets<br />
					round the whole crop,<br />
					to see if we can find out what lair they disappear to.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they staked in the whole crop all round about, -<br />
					but failed to discover the lair<br />
					the deer disappeared to.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the trapper and his people thought to themselves: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If we upset this fourth herd,<br />
					they in turn will upset their neighbours<br />
					and so on all alpng the line,<br />
					so that no deer at all<br />
					will ever come near our crop;<br />
					we had better take no notice of them at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they took no notice of that fourth herd, -<br />
					which thus succeeded in escaping<br />
					the trapper's mastery in craft.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></a> This is an allegory, Almsmen,<br />
					framed by me to illustrate my meaning,<br />
					which is as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">The crop<br />
					typifies the five pleasures of sense;<br />
					the trapper<br />
					stands for Māra, the Evil One;<br />
					the trapper's people<br />
					are Māra's train; and<br />
					the deer<br />
					represent recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, a first set of recluses and brahmins,<br />
					wildly rushing in on the crop Māra had sown<br />
					and on what the world can bestow,<br />
					have taken their fill thereof,<br />
					thereby losing their heads<br />
					and thus getting off their guard,<br />
					so that, being off their guard,<br />
					they can be dealt with by Māra<br />
					as he pleases amid the crop he has sown<br />
					and amid what the world can bestow.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is how the first set of recluses and brahmins<br />
					failed to escape from Māra's mastery of craft; -<br />
					they, say I, are like the first herd of deer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first set of recluses and brahmins<br />
					came by their fate,<br />
					a second set resolved to keep quite clear<br />
					of the lure of what the world could bestow,<br />
					leaving untouched so fearsome a diet,<br />
					and to retire to the forest,<br />
					there to subsist on green herbs,<br />
					the grain of wild millets and paddy,<br />
					snippets of hides,<br />
					water-plants,<br />
					the red dust that lines the rice husk,<br />
					the discarded scum of boiling rice,<br />
					the flour of oil-seeds,<br />
					grass,<br />
					cowdung,<br />
					wild roots and fruits,<br />
					or on windfalls alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">This they did<br />
					until, with the coming of the last month of the hot season,<br />
					when grass and water gave out<br />
					and their bodies grew emaciated in the extreme,<br />
					their heart's Deliverance failed,<br />
					and back they came to the crop Māra had sown<br />
					and what the world can bestow.</p>

					<p class="f4">With an infatuated inrush,<br />
					they took their fill,<br />
					thereby losing their heads<br />
					and getting off their guard,<br />
					so that, being off their guard,<br />
					they could be dealt with by Māra<br />
					as he pleased amid the crop he had sown<br />
					and amid what the world had to bestow.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the second set of recluses and brahmins<br />
					failed to escape<br />
					from Māra's mastery of craft; -<br />
					they, say I, are like the second herd of deer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first and second sets of <a id="pg111"><span class="f2 g"><b>[111]</b></span></a> recluses and brahmins<br />
					had come by their fate,<br />
					a third set resolved instead<br />
					to take up their abode hard by the crop Māra had sown<br />
					and what the world could bestow,<br />
					but, making no mad rush in,<br />
					to partake thereof with circumspection<br />
					and without losing their heads<br />
					and without getting off their guard,<br />
					so as not to be at Māra's mercy<br />
					amid the crop he had sown<br />
					and amid what the world could bestow.</p>

					<p class="f4">This they did.</p>

					<p class="f4">But they came to entertain<br />
					such speculative views as the following: -<br />
					The world is everlasting, -<br />
					the world is not everlasting -<br />
					the world is finite, -<br />
					the world is infinite,<br />
					the body is the life <i>(jīva)</i>, -<br />
					the body is one thing and the life another, -<br />
					a truth-finder exists after death, -<br />
					a truth-finder does not exist after death, -<br />
					he both exists and does not exist after death, -<br />
					he neither exists nor does not exist after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the third set of recluses and brahmins<br />
					failed to escape from Māra's mastery of craft; -<br />
					they, say I, are like the third herd of deer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing precisely how the first three sets of recluses and brahmins<br />
					had respectively come by their fate,<br />
					a fourth set resolved instead<br />
					to take up their abode<br />
					where Māra and his train could not penetrate,<br />
					and, from this security,<br />
					making no mad rush in,<br />
					to partake of Māra's crop<br />
					and what the world could bestow,<br />
					but with circumspection<br />
					and without losing their heads<br />
					and without getting off their guard,<br />
					so as not to be at Māra's mercy amid the crop he had sown<br />
					and what the world had to bestow.</p>

					<p class="f4">This they did.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that is how the fourth set of recluses and brahmins<br />
					succeeded in escaping Māra's mastery of craft; -<br />
					they, say I, are like the fourth herd of deer.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, how find a retreat<br />
					where Māra and his train cannot penetrate?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of mind,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a Brother is said to have hoodwinked Māra<br />
					and to have <a id="pg112"><span class="f2 g"><b>[112]</b></span></a> put Māra's sight out of gear,<br />
					so as to have passed out of range of vision of the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by rising above observation and reflection<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by shedding the emotions of zest and satisfaction,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness<br />
					bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by putting from him<br />
					both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that knows neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant,<br />
					the clarity that comes of poised equanimity<br />
					and alert mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by passing altogether beyond perception of visible forms,<br />
					by ceasing from perception of sense-reactions,<br />
					by not heeding perception of diversified impressions,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by passing altogether beyond the plane of infinity of space,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by passing altogether beyond the plane of infinity of consciousness,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by passing altogether beyond the plane of Naught,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked ... the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by <a id="pg113"><span class="f2 g"><b>[113]</b></span></a> passing altogether beyond the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane where feeling and perception cease,<br />
					and where, because wisdom gives him vision,<br />
					the Cankers become eradicated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked Māra<br />
					and to have put Māra's sight out of gear,<br />
					so as to have passed out of range of vision of the Evil One<br />
					and to have passed - here and now - beyond desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
