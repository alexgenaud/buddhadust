A detailed analysis of how attachment to the six sense realms leads to rebirth and how detachment from the six sense realms leads to the development of the 8-fold path, the four settings-up of memory, the four best efforts, the four power paths, the five forces, the five powers, the seven dimensions of self-awakening, calm and insight and knowledge and freedom (that is, arahantship)." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he intimated to the Almsmen<br />
					that he would instruct them<br />
					in the import of the Six Great Domains of Sense,<br />
					and thus began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If a man lacks ken and vision<br />
					of the sense of sight -<br />
					and of Forms -<br />
					and of ocular perception -<br />
					and of ocular Contact -<br />
					and of the feelings,<br />
					pleasant<br />
					unpleasant<br />
					or neither,<br />
					which arise because of ocular contact, -<br />
					then he grows enamoured of all these things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he lives thus enamoured<br />
					and immersed<br />
					and infatuated with them<br />
					and with the satisfaction they bring,<br />
					the five factors of love of existence grow up;<br />
					and there is a sturdy growth<br />
					of cravings for a future life<br />
					with a passionate delight<br />
					and revelling in the thought of it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is a growth both of bodily<br />
					<a id="pt288" href="../../pali/mn/mn.149.pali.bd.htm#pg288"><span class="f2">[288]</span></a> and of mental distress,<br />
					of bodily and mental inflammation<br />
					and of bodily and mental fever;<br />
					the man experiences ills of mind<br />
					and ills of body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And precisely the same happens<br />
					with each of the other five senses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, however, a man has ken and vision<br />
					of the sense of sight<br />
					and its objects,<br />
					and of ocular perception,<br />
					Contact and the feelings,<br />
					pleasant<br />
					unpleasant<br />
					or neither,<br />
					which arise because of ocular contact, -<br />
					then he never grows enamoured of these things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he lives thus unenamoured,<br />
					un-immersed<br />
					and un-infatuated<br />
					either with them<br />
					or with the satisfaction they bring,<br />
					the five factors of love of existence wane;<br />
					and there is a decay of cravings for a future life<br />
					and no passionate delight<br />
					and revelling in the thought of it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is a decay<br />
					both of bodily<br />
					and of mental distress,<br />
					of bodily and mental inflammation<br />
					and of bodily and <a id="pt289" href="../../pali/mn/mn.149.pali.bd.htm#pg289"><span class="f2">[289]</span></a> mental fever;<br />
					the man experiences weal in mind<br />
					and weal in body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The outlook of the man<br />
					with heart set aright<br />
					and at ease, -<br />
					this right outlook is his;<br />
					and his too is the right <a id="pg320"><span class="f2 g"><b>[320]</b></span></a> aspiration,<br />
					the right endeavour,<br />
					the right mindfulness<br />
					and the right rapture of concentration<br />
					which mark the man<br />
					whose heart is set right<br />
					and at ease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ere this,<br />
					he has already attained<br />
					to purity of act<br />
					and word<br />
					and of mode of livelihood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus, the (whole) Noble Eightfold Path<br />
					proceeds to its perfected development;<br />
					and with the Path's development<br />
					the fourfold mustering of mindfulness<br />
					similarly proceeds to its perfected development,<br />
					as too do the four efforts,<br />
					the four psychic powers,<br />
					the five faculties,<br />
					the five forces<br />
					and the seven factors of enlightenment,<br />
					while the twin yoke-fellows,<br />
					calm and intuition,<br />
					are at their work.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By transcendent knowledge<br />
					(a) he comprehends what transcendent knowledge should comprehend,<br />
					(b) discards what transcendent knowledge should discard,<br />
					(c) fosters what transcendent knowledge should foster, and<br />
					(d) realizes what transcendent knowledge should realize.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(a) That which transcendent knowledge should comprehend,<br />
					implies the five supporting factors of<br />
					forms,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the factors<br />
					and consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(b) That which transcendent knowledge should discard,<br />
					is ignorance and craving for continuing existence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(c) That which transcendent knowledge should foster,<br />
					is calm and intuition.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(d) <a id="pt290" href="../../pali/mn/mn.149.pali.bd.htm#pg290"><span class="f2">[290]</span></a> That which transcendent knowledge should realize,<br />
					is Understanding and Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And all that has been said<br />
					of the sense of sight<br />
					applies equally to the other five senses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
