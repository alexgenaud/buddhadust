					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_kurus">Kuru</a> country -<br />
					<a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kammasadhamma">Kammassadhamma</a> is the name of a township of theirs -<br />
					in the fire-hut of the brahmin Bhāradvāja-gotta, in which a grass mat was laid.</p>

					<p class="f4">In <a id="pg354"><span class="f2 g"><b>[354]</b></span></a> the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord went into the township for alms<br />
					and was on his way back after his meal<br />
					when he came to a wood<br />
					into which he went to spend the noontide,<br />
					seating himself under a tree for the heat of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt502" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg502"><span class="f2">[502]</span></a> Now the Wanderer Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					in the course of his roamings and peregrinations afoot,<br />
					came to this fire-hut<br />
					and, seeing the grass mat laid,<br />
					asked the brahmin whom it was for,<br />
					observing that it suggested the pallet of a recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has been laid, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					for the recluse Gotama, the Sakyan,<br />
					who has gone forth from a Sakyan home on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the high repute noised abroad concerning him<br />
					that he is styled the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is an annoyance<br />
					to set eyes on the pallet of Gotama,<br />
					that rigid repressionist.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Take care what you say, Māgaṇḍiya;<br />
					take care what you say;<br />
					for, many are the sages<br />
					among Nobles, brahmins, householders and recluses<br />
					who are earnest believers in him<br />
					and trained in Noble knowledge,<br />
					in the Doctrine,<br />
					and in what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I could see him face to face,<br />
					I would tell him to his face, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					that he is a repressionist, -<br />
					because our Scriptures say so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you do not mind my doing so,<br />
					I will tell this to the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray do not scruple to tell him<br />
					what you have been told.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg355"><span class="f2 g"><b>[355]</b></span></a> With the Ear Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					the Lord heard the conversation between these two.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					the Lord betook him to the brahmin's fire-hut<br />
					and sat down on the grass mat laid out for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him came the brahmin,<br />
					who, after salutations,<br />
					took his seat to one side<br />
					and was thus by the Lord addressed:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">There was some talk, Bhāradvāja,<br />
					between you and the Wanderer Māgaṇḍiya <a id="pt503" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg503"><span class="f2">[503]</span></a><br />
					as touching this same mat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Greatly surprised and startled,<br />
					the brahmin said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why that is precisely what I was about to tell you, sir,<br />
					when you anticipated me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Their talk was interrupted<br />
					by the return of the Wanderer to the hut,<br />
					who, after salutations,<br />
					sat down to one side,<br />
					to be thus addressed by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye, Māgaṇḍiya -<br />
					of which visible shapes<br />
					are the domain<br />
					and the delight<br />
					and the satisfaction -<br />
					has been subjugated,<br />
					shielded,<br />
					safe-guarded<br />
					and kept under watch and ward<br />
					by the Truth-finder,<br />
					who preaches the Doctrine of its watch and ward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Was it with reference to the eye<br />
					that you said<br />
					the recluse Gotama is a rigid repressionist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it was; -<br />
					because our Scriptures say so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Was your remark made with reference to the ear -<br />
					which has sounds for its domain -,<br />
					to smell -<br />
					which has odours for its domain -,<br />
					to the tongue -<br />
					which has tastes for its domain -,<br />
					to the body -<br />
					which has touch for its domain -,<br />
					to consciousness -<br />
					which has states of mind for its domain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Was it with reference to these -<br />
					all of which have been subjugated by the Truth-finder,<br />
					who preaches the Doctrine for their watch and ward -<br />
					that you said<br />
					the recluse Gotama is a rigid repressionist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it was; -<br />
					because it is on these lines<br />
					that you criticize our tenets.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think of this, Māgaṇḍiya?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who <a id="pt504" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg504"><span class="f2">[504]</span></a> aforetime<br />
					revelled in the visible shapes<br />
					of which the eye takes cognizance, -<br />
					shapes which are desirable, agreeable,<br />
					pleasant and attractive,<br />
					bound up <a id="pg356"><span class="f2 g"><b>[356]</b></span></a>  with pleasures of sense,<br />
					and exciting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that later on,<br />
					through coming to know them for what they really are -<br />
					through coming to know their origin<br />
					and cessation,<br />
					the satisfaction<br />
					and the troubles they entail,<br />
					and their final outcome -,<br />
					he discards all craving for them,<br />
					dispels the fever they bring,<br />
					loses all appetite for them,<br />
					so that he dwells with his heart at peace within him.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you to lay to his charge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nothing, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or take the case of a man<br />
					who similarly discards sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					or touch.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you to lay to his charge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, I myself, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					in those days when I had a home,<br />
					was lapped in the pleasures of the five senses<br />
					and revelled in sights,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes<br />
					and touch, -<br />
					which are desirable, agreeable,<br />
					pleasant and attractive,<br />
					bound up with pleasures of sense,<br />
					and exciting.</p>

					<p class="f4">Three palaces were mine,<br />
					one for the rainy season,<br />
					another for the winter,<br />
					and another for the summer.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the palace for the rainy reason<br />
					I lived during the four months of the rains,<br />
					ministered to by bands of women musicians,<br />
					never coming down to the lower floors.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later on,<br />
					through coming to know these pleasures for what they really are -<br />
					through coming to know their origin<br />
					and cessation,<br />
					the satisfaction<br />
					and the troubles they entail,<br />
					and their final outcome -,<br />
					I discarded all craving for them,<br />
					dispelled the fever they bring,<br />
					lost all appetite for them,<br />
					so that I dwelt with my heart at peace within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I observed others<br />
					still held by pleasure in passion's meshes,<br />
					still the prey of pleasure,<br />
					still afire with the fever of pleasure,<br />
					still the votaries of pleasure;<br />
					I envied them not<br />
					nor took delight in such things.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because there is a delight which is aloof from pleasures of sense<br />
					and from things which are wrong<br />
					and is based on the attainment of bliss Celestial;<br />
					<a id="pt505" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg505"><span class="f2">[505]</span></a> and it was in the enjoyment of this delight<br />
					that I neither envied the lower<br />
					nor took delight therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a wealthy householder or his son,<br />
					of great <a id="pg357"><span class="f2 g"><b>[357]</b></span></a> treasures and substance,<br />
					who, while living a life<br />
					lapped in these divers pleasures of the five senses<br />
					that are so desirable,<br />
					agreeable, ... and exciting,<br />
					lives aright in deed, word and thought<br />
					so that at his body's dissolution after death<br />
					he passes to bliss celestial<br />
					to consort with the Thirty-three gods,<br />
					and there, surrounded by a throng of nymphs<br />
					in the Grove of Gladness,<br />
					is lapped in every celestial pleasure of the five senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Supposing now that he sees a householder or his son<br />
					on earth<br />
					lapped in divers pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Māgaṇḍiya?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that new deity,<br />
					who lives surrounded by a throng of nymphs<br />
					in the Grove of Gladness,<br />
					lapped in every celestial pleasure of the five senses, -<br />
					would he envy that earthly householder or his son<br />
					or their earthly pleasures?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he turn again to earthly pleasure?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Gotama; he would not; -<br />
					because celestial pleasures are choicer<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than human pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was just the same with me<br />
					who in bygone days, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					when I had a home,<br />
					was lapped in the pleasures of the five senses<br />
					but later on,<br />
					through coming to know. ...<br />
					<a id="pt506" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg506"><span class="f2">[506]</span></a> I neither envied the lower<br />
					nor took delight therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a leper<br />
					who, with his limbs all sores and rottenness,<br />
					is being eaten alive by worms<br />
					and tears his open wounds with his nails<br />
					and scorches his frame over a pit of hot embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now his friends and kinsfolk<br />
					bring him a leech<br />
					who makes him up a medicine<br />
					whereby he is cured of his leprosy<br />
					and is hale and well,<br />
					able to get about<br />
					and go where he will.</p>

					<p class="f4">If now he sees another leper<br />
					in the selfsame plight, -<br />
					do you think he would envy that leper<br />
					either his pit of embers<br />
					or his course of medicine?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, -<br />
					because medicines are wanted not in health<br />
					but in illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was just the same with me, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					who, in those days<br />
					when I had a home,<br />
					was lapped in all pleasures of the five senses<br />
					and revelled in desirable and agreeable sights,<br />
					but later on,<br />
					through coming to <a id="pg358"><span class="f2 g"><b>[358]</b></span></a> know those pleasures<br />
					for what they really are ...<br />
					I neither envied the lower<br />
					nor took delight therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt507" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg507"><span class="f2">[507]</span></a> It is like a leper<br />
					who, with his limbs all sores ...<br />
					able to get about<br />
					and go where he will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now two strong men<br />
					dragged him along by the arms<br />
					towards a pit of embers, -<br />
					do you suppose he would struggle and resist?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Gotama; -<br />
					because the fire and contact with it<br />
					would greatly torture and scorch him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this something new,<br />
					or was it all there before?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire<br />
					and the contact<br />
					and the scorching<br />
					are no different now<br />
					to what they were.</p>

					<p class="f4">The difference is that,<br />
					in the former instance<br />
					the leper, - when his limbs were all sores and rottenness,<br />
					and when he was being eaten alive by worms<br />
					and was tearing his open wounds with his nails<br />
					and was beside himself - actually -<br />
					found in the pain of contact with the fire<br />
					a change of sensation<br />
					to what seemed bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">Precisely in the same way, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					pleasures of sense<br />
					always have been,<br />
					always will be,<br />
					and always are<br />
					painful in contact,<br />
					always torturing and scorching.</p>

					<p class="f4">And those who are held by pleasure<br />
					in passions meshes,<br />
					who are still the prey of pleasure,<br />
					still afire with the fever of pleasure,<br />
					still the votaries of pleasure<br />
					and beside themselves, -<br />
					all these actually find<br />
					in the pain of contact with pleasures of sense<br />
					a change of sensation<br />
					to what to them seems bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a leper<br />
					who, with his limbs all sores and rottenness,<br />
					while he is being eaten alive by worms,<br />
					and while he tears his open wounds with his nails,<br />
					scorches his frame over a pit of embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">The more that leper does so,<br />
					the more do his open sores<br />
					<a id="pt508" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg508"><span class="f2">[508]</span></a> stink with the noisome stench of putrefaction,<br />
					and he finds but sorry relief and satisfaction<br />
					from scratching their itching surface.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with those<br />
					who, being held by pleasure in passion's meshes,<br />
					who, being still the prey of pleasure,<br />
					still afire with the fever of pleasure,<br />
					and still the votaries of pleasure,<br />
					continue on with pleasures of sense; -<br />
					the longer they go on,<br />
					the stronger grows their craving for passion,<br />
					and the hotter <a id="pg359"><span class="f2 g"><b>[359]</b></span></a> rages the fever of passion within them,<br />
					and they find but sorry relief and satisfaction<br />
					from their indulgences.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you either seen or heard of a prince<br />
					or great lord<br />
					who, being lapped in pleasure,<br />
					has ever lived -<br />
					or is now living -<br />
					or indeed will ever live -<br />
					with his heart at peace within him,<br />
					unless he has first discarded all craving for sensuous pleasures,<br />
					has dispelled the fever they bring,<br />
					and has lost all appetite for them?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Māgaṇḍiya; -<br />
					nor have I.</p>

					<p class="f4">But all recluses and brahmins<br />
					who have been -<br />
					or now are -<br />
					or hereafter will be -<br />
					triumphant over pleasures of sense,<br />
					with their hearts at peace within them, -<br />
					all,<br />
					all,<br />
					achieve their triumph<br />
					through realizing how pleasure originates<br />
					and how it ends,<br />
					and what are its satisfactions,<br />
					perils<br />
					and vanity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the occasion of the Lords solemn utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Chief boon is Health; Nirvana's bliss stands first;<br />
							Of Deathless Paths the Eightfold leads to Peace.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Māgaṇḍiya said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, Gotama,<br />
					it is marvellous<br />
					how truly you say that</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt509" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg509"><span class="f2">[509]</span></a> <i>Chief boon is Health; Nirvana's bliss comes first.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I myself have also heard it said<br />
					by the Wanderers of old,<br />
					teachers themselves<br />
					and the teachers of teachers, that -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Chief boon is Health; Nirvana's bliss stands first.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is complete accord here, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this line which you have heard from the Wanderers of old, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					what is Health?<br />
					and what is Nirvana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Here the Wanderer stroked his own limbs and said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Health, Gotama;<br />
					this is Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, at the present time<br />
					I am in health and well-being,<br />
					without any ailments at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man blind from birth, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					who <a id="pg360"><span class="f2 g"><b>[360]</b></span></a> cannot see dark and light things,<br />
					or blue or yellow<br />
					or red or pink things;<br />
					who cannot see level or rough ground,<br />
					the stars,<br />
					or the sun and moon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose, on hearing a man with sight say<br />
					that a goodly white robe without blemish<br />
					was a fine thing to possess,<br />
					this blind man were to sally forth<br />
					to get one for himself,<br />
					only to be fobbed off<br />
					with greasy, grimy, trashy stuff<br />
					which was vouched for as all right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now he took it,<br />
					put it on,<br />
					and expressed his delight<br />
					by saying that a goodly white robe without blemish<br />
					was a fine thing to possess.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you suppose that,<br />
					if the man blind from birth<br />
					had had knowledge and vision,<br />
					he would have taken that greasy, grimy, trashy stuff<br />
					and have been so pleased with it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or did he take it on trust<br />
					from the man who could see?</p>

					<p class="f4">Only from lack of knowledge and vision,<br />
					and out of trust in him who could see,<br />
					would the blind man have been deluded like that.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt510" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg510"><span class="f2">[510]</span></a> Just in the same way<br />
					non-conformist Wanderers,<br />
					being blind and without eyes,<br />
					lacking knowledge of Health and Vision of Nirvana,<br />
					yet utter the verse -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Chief boon is Health; Nirvanas bliss stands first.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">It was the Arahats all-enlightened of old who uttered the verses -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Chief boon is Health; Nirvanas bliss stands first;<br />
							Of Deathless Paths the Eightfold leads to Peace.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">By degrees it has now filtered down to the everyday man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though this body, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					is a disease,<br />
					a pustulence,<br />
					a pang,<br />
					an anguish,<br />
					an ailment,<br />
					you say that here is Health and Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, you have not that Noble Eye<br />
					wherewith to know Health<br />
					and to have vision of Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">I believe the reverend Gotama<br />
					can teach me how to know Health<br />
					and have vision of Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					blind from birth, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					unable to see dark and light things ...<br />
					or the sun and moon,<br />
					to whom his friends and kinsfolk bring a <a id="pg361"><span class="f2 g"><b>[361]</b></span></a> leech<br />
					who makes him up a medicine<br />
					whereby he fails to give him eyes<br />
					or to clarify them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you not suppose the leech<br />
					will have taken a lot of toil and trouble over it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					I might teach you what Health and Nirvana are,<br />
					but you would not either know Health<br />
					or have vision of Nirvana; -<br />
					but I should have trouble and travail.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt511" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg511"><span class="f2">[511]</span></a>	I believe the reverend Gotama<br />
					can teach me how to know Health<br />
					and have vision of Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man blind from birth, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					unable to see anything,<br />
					who hears a man with sight say<br />
					that a goodly white robe without blemish ...<br />
					vouched for as all right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that he takes it and puts it on;<br />
					and suppose further that his friends and kinsfolk<br />
					bring him a leech,<br />
					who makes him up a medicament<br />
					for application above and beneath,<br />
					and solvents,<br />
					and cooling ointments,<br />
					and nasal injections,<br />
					so that he gives the blind man his eyes<br />
					and clarifies them, -<br />
					with the consequence that he quite loses his passion<br />
					for that grimy, greasy, trash<br />
					and regards the fellow who sold it him<br />
					as no friend<br />
					but as an enemy<br />
					who ought to be put to death<br />
					for having cheated, tricked and deluded him<br />
					by saying that greasy, grimy trash<br />
					was a goodly white robe without blemish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					if I were to teach you what Health is<br />
					and what Nirvana is,<br />
					and if you came to knowledge and vision of them,<br />
					then, so soon as you got eyes to see with,<br />
					you would quite discard your passion<br />
					for what breeds the five-fold maintenance of existence,<br />
					and your thought would then be:</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have I been cheated, tricked and deluded<br />
					by this heart of mine;<br />
					for, I was for ever engaged in encouraging things material,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness,<br />
					so that this encouragement led to existence,<br />
					which led to birth,<br />
					which led to decay and death<br />
					with sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					Ill and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt512" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg512"><span class="f2">[512]</span></a> Thus originates all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg362"><span class="f2 g"><b>[362]</b></span></a></p>

					<p class="f4">I believe the reverend Gotama<br />
					can teach me how I shall be blind no more<br />
					when I rise from this seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					consort with the good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consorting with the good,<br />
					you will hear sound doctrine,<br />
					and so will walk in accordance with the Doctrine,<br />
					and thereby will come -<br />
					of and by yourself -<br />
					to know and to see<br />
					that these things are diseases,<br />
					pustulences<br />
					and pangs;<br />
					that here they are stilled for ever;<br />
					that to still the stuff that makes them<br />
					leads on for you<br />
					to the stilling of continued existence,<br />
					which in turn leads on to the stilling of birth<br />
					and so of decay<br />
					with sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					Ill and tribulation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus ends all that makes up the sum of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the Wanderer Māgaṇḍiya said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, Gotama;<br />
					quite marvellous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.073.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No, 73</a>) ... <a id="pt513" href="../../pali/mn/mn.075.pali.bd.htm#pg513"><span class="f2">[513]</span></a><br />
					was admitted and confirmed of the Lord's following.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor was it long before the reverend Māgaṇḍiya,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof, ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.073.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 73</a>) ...<br />
					was numbered among the Arahats.</p>

He explains that, whereas the Buddha prescribed watch and ward over the senses, this Wanderer believed in giving them full scope, advocating not 'a cloistered virtue' but complete experience <i>('tout savoir')</i> as a stage to ultimate mastery.</p>
