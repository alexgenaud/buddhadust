					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in the Old Pleasaunce<br />
					in the palace of Migara's mother,<br />
					with numbers of well-known Elders and disciples, -<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					Mahā-Moggallāna,<br />
					Mahā-Kassapa,<br />
					Mahā-Kaccāyana,<br />
					Mahā-Koṭṭhita,<br />
					Mahā Kappina,<br />
					Mahā-Cunda,<br />
					<a id="pt79" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg79"><span class="f2">[79]</span></a> Anuruddha,<br />
					Revata<br />
					and Ānanda,<br />
					together with other well-known Elders and disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time the Almsmen who were Elders<br />
					were instructing and teaching the novices, -<br />
					some taking ten,<br />
					others twenty<br />
					or thirty<br />
					or forty;<br />
					and under this instruction and teaching<br />
					the novices grew to higher and higher specific attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the Sabbath of the full-moon<br />
					at the end of the rains<br />
					the Lord was sitting in the open<br />
					in the moon- <a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> light,<br />
					with the Confraternity gathered around him,<br />
					when, observing silence to reign among them all,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen in these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">I find content in this vocation;<br />
					in it 1 find contentment of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Almsmen,<br />
					strive ever more and more zealously<br />
					to attain the yet unattained,<br />
					to gain the yet ungained<br />
					and to realize the yet unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">I look to be back here again<br />
					in Sāvatthī by Komudi,<br />
					the full-moon day of the fourth month.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it reached the ears<br />
					of the Almsmen belonging to that country<br />
					that the Lord was expected back in Sāvatthī at this date,<br />
					they came into the city to see the Lord;<br />
					the Elders grew keener and keener<br />
					in instructing and teaching each their novices, -<br />
					ten,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty<br />
					or forty of them<br />
					as the case might be;<br />
					and under this instruction and teaching<br />
					the novices <a id="pt80" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg80"><span class="f2">[80]</span></a> grew to higher and higher specific attainments.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the sabbath of Komudi,<br />
					on the fifteenth,<br />
					the full-moon day of the fourth month,<br />
					the Lord was sitting in the open in the moonlight,<br />
					with the Confraternity gathered around him,<br />
					when, observing silence to reign among them all,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen in these words: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no talking,<br />
					all talk is stilled in this assembly<br />
					which is set (as it were) in a shining mere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is this Confraternity of Almsmen -<br />
					or a company like this,<br />
					-that it is worthy of oblations,<br />
					offerings,<br />
					gifts<br />
					and homage<br />
					and is the richest field<br />
					in which to sow the seed of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is this Confraternity<br />
					and such this company<br />
					that a little thing given to it<br />
					thereby becomes great<br />
					and a great thing<br />
					becomes greater still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a Confraternity<br />
					or Company as this<br />
					would be hard to find in the whole world.</p>

					<p class="f4">To see such a Confraternity<br />
					and company as this<br />
					it is worth journeying many a league<br />
					carrying the burden of provisions for the journey.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is this Confraternity<br />
					and such is this company.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity there are arahats, -<br />
					Almsmen in whom the Cankers are dead,<br />
					who have lived the highest life,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have cast off their burthen,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					who have destroyed all bonds<br />
					that bound them to the <a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> ceaseless round of existence,<br />
					who have found the Deliverance of utter Knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity<br />
					there are Almsmen who,<br />
					by destroying the five bonds<br />
					which bind men to the sensuous world,<br />
					will pass hence<br />
					to appear spontaneously elsewhere,<br />
					never to return thence to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity<br />
					are Almsmen who,<br />
					by destroying the three bonds<br />
					and also by minlshing passion malice and delusion,<br />
					have become Once-returners and,<br />
					on their last return to this world,<br />
					will <a id="pt81" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg81"><span class="f2">[81]</span></a> make an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity<br />
					there are Almsmen who,<br />
					by destroying the three bonds,<br />
					are launched on the stream of salvation,<br />
					safe from any evil doom hereafter,<br />
					assured of their future,<br />
					destined to find Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity<br />
					there are Almsmen who live<br />
					in the practice of the four mindful meditations, -<br />
					of the four exertions -<br />
					of the four bases of psychic power -<br />
					of the five faculties of sense -<br />
					of the five forces -<br />
					of the seven factors of enlightenment -<br />
					of the Noble Eightfold Path -<br />
					of friendliness to all -<br />
					<a id="pt82" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg82"><span class="f2">[82]</span></a> of compassion for all -<br />
					of rejoicing with all -<br />
					of poised equanimity -<br />
					of pondering on foulness -<br />
					and on the perception of transiency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Within this Confraternity<br />
					there are Almsmen<br />
					who live in the practice<br />
					of cultivating mindfulness by breathing exercises.</p>

					<p class="f4">If cultivated and developed,<br />
					mindfulness by breathing<br />
					is very fruitful and profitable;<br />
					- it perfects the four bases of mindfulness,<br />
					which, being perfected,<br />
					perfect the seven factors of enlightenment,<br />
					which, being perfected,<br />
					perfect in turn Deliverance by comprehension.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, Almsmen, is mindfulness by breathing cultivated and developed<br />
					so as to prove very fruitful and profitable? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman who,<br />
					in the forest<br />
					or at the foot of a tree<br />
					or in an abode of solitude,<br />
					sits cross-legged<br />
					with body erect,<br />
					with mindfulness as the objective he sets before himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">In mindfulness he takes in breath<br />
					and in mindfulness he exhales it;<br />
					he knows precisely what he is doing<br />
					when he is inhaling or exhaling<br />
					either a long breath<br />
					or a short breath;<br />
					he schools himself,<br />
					as he draws his breath in and out,<br />
					to be alive <a id="pg202"><span class="f2 g"><b>[202]</b></span></a> to his body as a whole -<br />
					or to still bodily factors -<br />
					or to experience contentment -<br />
					or <a id="pt83" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg83"><span class="f2">[83]</span></a> to experience wellbeing;<br />
					he schools himself,<br />
					in drawing his breath in and out,<br />
					to experience the heart's several factors -<br />
					or to still them -<br />
					or lo experience the heart as a whole -<br />
					or to satisfy the heart -<br />
					or to keep the heart stedfast -<br />
					or to set the heart free.</p>

					<p class="f4">He schools himself,<br />
					in drawing his breath in and out,<br />
					to dwell on the impermanence of things -<br />
					or on passionlessness -<br />
					or on the cessation of things -<br />
					or on eschewing them. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how mindfulness in breathing<br />
					is cultivated and developed<br />
					so as to prove very fruitful and profitable.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is mindfulness by breathing<br />
					cultivated and developed<br />
					so as to perfect the four bases of mindfulness? -</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is engaged in inhaling or exhaling,<br />
					with a precise knowledge of what he is doing,<br />
					either when inhaling or when exhaling<br />
					either a long breath or a short breath,<br />
					when schooling himself<br />
					either to experience the body as a whole<br />
					or to still the several bodily factors, -<br />
					all this time,<br />
					in his contemplation of the body as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					and mindful, -<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among the corporeal elements<br />
					(earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					and air)<br />
					I classify breath inhaled or exhaled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the Almsman<br />
					who contemplates the body as an aggregation,<br />
					dwells the while ardent,<br />
					alive to what he is doing,<br />
					and mindful, -<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">While <a id="pt84" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> he is engaged in schooling himself in his breathing<br />
					to experience contentment<br />
					or well-being,<br />
					or to experience the heart's several factors<br />
					or to still them, -<br />
					all this time,<br />
					in his contemplation of feelings as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					and mindful, -<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among feelings<br />
					I classify thorough attention<br />
					to breath inhaled or exhaled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore the Almsman<br />
					who contemplates feeling as an aggregation,<br />
					dwells the while ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					and mindful, -<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is engaged in schooling himself,<br />
					as he inhales or exhales,<br />
					<a id="pg203"><span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span></a> to experience the heart as a whole,<br />
					or to satisfy the heart,<br />
					or to keep the heart stedfast,<br />
					or to set the heart free, -<br />
					all this time,<br />
					in his contemplation of the heart as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					and mindful, -<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent;<br />
					the man of distracted mind,<br />
					say I,<br />
					cannot develop mindfulness in breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is engaged in schooling himself,<br />
					as he inhales or exhales,<br />
					to dwell either on the impermanence of things<br />
					or on passionlessness<br />
					or on the cessation of things<br />
					or on eschewing them, -<br />
					all this time,<br />
					in his contemplation of mental objects as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to everything,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Discerning by understanding<br />
					the abandonment of all wants and discontent,<br />
					<a id="pt85" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg85"><span class="f2">[85]</span></a> he surveys this theme exhaustively.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore,<br />
					in his contemplation of mental objects as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how mindfulness in breathing<br />
					is cultivated and developed<br />

					<p class="f4">How are the four bases of mindfulness<br />
					cultivated and developed<br />
					so as to perfect the seven factors of enlightenment? -</p>

					<p class="f4">While,<br />
					in his contemplation of the body as an aggregation,<br />
					the Almsman dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to all he is doing,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					quit of all worldly wants and discontent,<br />
					all this time<br />
					his mindfulness is growing fixed and undistracted,<br />
					with the result meanwhile<br />
					that the factor of enlightenment which consists of mindfulness is implanted,<br />
					that the Almsman develops it,<br />
					and that it moves on to perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living thus mindful,<br />
					he examines and scrutinizes, and analyzes<br />
					the mental object<br />
					with his understanding;<br />
					and as he is doing so,<br />
					the analytical factor of enlightenment<br />
					is meantime being implanted,<br />
					is being developed by the Almsman,<br />
					and is moving on to its perfect development,<br />
					with the concomitant result<br />
					that indomitable zeal is implanted,<br />
					and that this further factor of enlightenment is implanted,<br />
					is developed by the Almsman<br />
					and moves on to its perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg204"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></a> To the man with zeal implanted in him<br />

					and concomitantly <a id="pt86" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg86"><span class="f2">[86]</span></a> the factor of enlightenment<br />
					which consists in satisfaction<br />
					is implanted is developed by the Almsman,<br />
					and moves on to its perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4">The man with his mind satisfied<br />
					comes to enjoy tranquillity<br />
					alike of body and of heart,<br />
					and concomitandy the factor of tranquillity is implanted,<br />
					is developed by the Almsman,<br />
					and moves on to its perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4">The man with tranquillity and well-being of body<br />
					finds concentration of heart,<br />
					and concomitantly the concentration factor of enlightenment is implanted,<br />

					and moves on to its perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4">He surveys exhaustively as his theme<br />
					his heart thus sted-fast,<br />
					and concomitantly the factor of poised equanimity is implanted,<br />
					is developed by the Almsman,<br />
					and moves on to its perfect development.</p>

					<p class="f4">(And as it is with his contemplation of the body,<br />

					and of mental objects<br />
					<a id="pt87" href="../../pali/mn/mn.118.pali.bd.htm#pg87"><span class="f2">[87]</span></a>, each resulting in the perfect development<br />

					<p class="f4">This is how the four bases of mindfulness<br />

					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who develops in turn<br />

					<p class="f4">This is how the seven factors of enlightenment<br />
