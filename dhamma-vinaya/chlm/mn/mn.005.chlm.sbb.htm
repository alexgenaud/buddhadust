					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are four types of individuals in the world:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i.) The blemished man<br />
					who does not realize aright<br />
					the blemish within him;</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii.) the blemished man<br />
					who does realize it aright;</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii.) the unblemished man<br />
					who does not realize aright<br />
					that he is unblemished within; and</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv.) the unblemished man<br />
					who does realize it aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first pair -<br />
					of the blemished -<br />
					the second ranks high<br />
					and the first low;<br />
					and similarly in the second pair<br />
					the second ranks high<br />
					and the first low."</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna asked Sāriputta<br />
					what was the cause<br />
					and what were the conditions<br />
					whereby one of the two with blemishes,<br />
					and one of the two without blemishes,<br />
					was ranked high<br />
					and the other low.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Reverend sir," answered Sāriputta,<br />
					"it is to be expected of the man who is blemished<br />
					but does not realize it,<br />
					that he will not develop will-power,<br />
					will not exert himself<br />
					nor work to shed his blemishes;<br />
					he will die with heart corrupt<br />
					and with his blemishes still upon him,<br />
					a prey to passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a brass bowl<br />
					brought home from bazaar<br />
					or stithy covered with dust and dirt,<br />
					never to be used or scoured by its owners,<br />
					but just flung aside among the dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, would such a bowl grow fouler and fouler<br />
					till it became filthy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just in the same way<br />
					the man with blemishes<br />
					which he does not realize aright,<br />
					may be expected not to develop will-power ... delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					it is to be expected of the man with blemishes<br />
					which he does realize aright,<br />
					that he will develop will-power,<br />
					will exert himself,<br />
					will work to <a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> shed his blemishes,<br />
					and will die with heart uncorrupt<br />
					and without blemish,<br />
					quit of passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a brass bowl<br />
					brought home from bazaar<br />
					or stithy covered with dust and dirt,<br />
					to be used and scoured by its owners<br />
					and not to be flung aside among the dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, would such a bowl grow cleaner and cleaner<br />
					till it became spotless?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just in the same way<br />
					the man with blemishes<br />
					which he realizes aright,<br />
					may be expected to develop will-power ...<br />
					quit of passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the man who is without blemish<br />
					but does not realize it aright,<br />
					it is to be expected<br />
					that his mind will dwell on seductive ideas<br />
					and that in consequence<br />
					passion will degrade his heart;<br />
					he will die with heart corrupt<br />
					and with his blemishes still upon him,<br />
					a prey to passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a brass bowl<br />
					brought home from bazaar<br />
					or stithy clean and bright,<br />
					never to be used or scoured by its owners<br />
					but just flung aside among the dust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, would such a bowl grow fouler and fouler<br />
					till it became filthy?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just in the same way<br />
					the man who is without blemish<br />
					but does not recognize it aright,<br />
					may be expected to let his mind dwell on seductive ideas<br />
					and in consequence<br />
					to have his heart degraded by passion,<br />
					so that he will die with heart corrupt<br />
					and with his blemishes still upon him,<br />
					a prey to passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, it is to be expected of the man without blemish<br />
					who realizes it aright,<br />
					that his mind will not dwell on seductive ideas,<br />
					and therefore that passion will not degrade his heart,<br />
					and that he will die with heart uncorrupt<br />
					and without blemish,<br />
					quit of passion,<br />
					hate,<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a brass bowl<br />

					<p class="f4">This, reverend Moggallāna, is the cause<br />
					and these are the conditions<br />
					whereby one of the two with blemishes,<br />
					and one of the two without blemishes,<br />
					is ranked high and the other low."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Blemish' is simply called 'blemish,' reverend sir<br />
					(said Moggallāna).</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the term connote?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Blemish', reverend sir,<br />
					connotes the domain of bad and wrong desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise<br />
					of an Almsman who conceives the desire that,<br />
					should he commit an offence,<br />
					his fellows should not know of it;<br />
					and who, when they do come to know of it,<br />
					waxes angry and wroth at their knowing it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This anger and dissatisfaction<br />
					are both blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he may conceive the desire that,<br />
					should he commit an offence,<br />
					his fellows should reprove him in private<br />
					and not in conclave;<br />
					and when they reprove him in conclave,<br />
					he waxes angry and wroth at their doing so.</p>

					<p class="f4">This anger and dissatisfaction<br />
					are both blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he may conceive the idea that,<br />
					should he commit an offence,<br />
					he may be reproved by an equal<br />
					and not by one on an inequality with him;<br />
					and when reproof comes from one not his equal,<br />
					he waxes angry and wroth.</p>

					<p class="f4">This anger and dissatisfaction<br />
					are both blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he may conceive the desire<br />
					that the Master should expound the Doctrine to the Confraternity<br />
					through a series of questions addressed to him alone<br />
					and to no other Almsman;<br />
					and, if the questions are addressed not to him<br />
					but to another,<br />
					he waxes angry and wroth at being passed over.</p>

					<p class="f4">This anger and dissatisfaction<br />
					are both blemishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Blemishes too<br />
					are his anger and dissatisfaction<br />
					if he is disappointed in the desire -<br />
					to be the centre figure -<br />
					he and no other -<br />
					to lead a train of Almsmen into the village for alms;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Blemish', reverend sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">If they are seen,<br />
					and heard,<br />

					albeit his abode be in the depths of the forest,<br />
					albeit he begs his food from door to door<br />
					just as the houses come,<br />
					and is coarsely clad<br />
					in rags from the dust-heap -<br />
					not unto him do his fellows in the higher life shew respect<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because bad and wrong desires<br />
					are seen<br />
					and heard to be immanent in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a brass bowl,<br />

					even so, sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">But if these bad and wrong desires are seen,<br />

					shew respect<br />

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has put from him<br />

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a brass bowl,<br />

					of picked varieties<br />
					together with divers sauces<br />
					and <a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> curries,<br />
					and were then to hie back to the bazaar<br />

					if these bad and wrong desires<br />
					are seen, and heard,<br />
					to have been put from him by an Almsman,<br />
					then-albeit he lives ...<br />
					and wrong desires."</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna<br />
					remarked to Sāriputta<br />
					that an illustration had occurred to him and,<br />
					on being invited to cite it, said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Early one morning,<br />
					when I was staying once on the heights that encircle Rājagaha,<br />
					I went for alms into the city,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					at a time when Samīti, the waggon-builder,<br />
					was shaping a felloe;<br />
					and by him there was standing Paṇḍu-putta the Mendicant <i>(ājīvika)</i><br />
					himself come of a waggon-building stock in bygone days -<br />
					in whom arose the wish<br />
					that Samīti might shape the felloe<br />
					without crook<br />
					or twist<br />
					or blemish,<br />
					so that, free from crook,<br />
					twist<br />
					and blemish,<br />
					the felloe might turn out clean and of the best;<br />
					and while this thought was passing through the mind of Pandu-putta,<br />
					the old waggon-builder,<br />
					all the time Samīti was shaping away crook,<br />
					twist<br />
					and blemish.</p>

					<p class="f4">At last Paṇḍu-putta<br />
					in his joy<br />
					burst out with the joyous cry -</p>

					<p class="f4">'His heart, me-thinks, knows my heart,<br />
					as he shapes that felloe!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so is it here.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, take first those persons who,<br />
					not for their belief<br />
					but for a livelihood<br />
					and without believing,<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims, -<br />
					cunning and deceitful tricksters,<br />
					vain and puffed-up,<br />
					raucous babblers<br />
					who keep no watch over the portals of sense,<br />
					intemperate in their eating,<br />
					devoid of vigilance,<br />
					taking no thought of their vocation<br />
					nor keen for its discipline,<br />
					acquisitive<br />
					and with only a loose grip of truth,<br />
					foremost in backsliding<br />
					and intolerant of Renunciation's yoke,<br />
					indolent and slack,<br />
					bewildered and flustered,<br />
					unstable and wandering,<br />
					witless and drivelling. -<br />
					Sāriputta's heart, methinks,<br />
					knows the heart of <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> all these persons<br />
					and is at work in his exposition<br />
					to shape them aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take next those young men<br />
					who, for beliefs sake,<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims, -<br />
					in whom these shortcomings find no place<br />
					but only their counterparts in virtue -<br />
					these, as they hear the reverend Sāriputta's exposition<br />
					drink it in, methinks,<br />
					and feed upon it, methinks,<br />
					with words of thanksgiving<br />
					from grateful hearts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right well has Sāriputta raised up his fellows in the higher life<br />
					from what is wrong<br />
					and established them in what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if,<br />
					after the bath,<br />
					a woman or a lad<br />
					young and fond of finery<br />
					were to be given a chaplet of lotuses<br />
					or jasmine<br />
					or other blossoms<br />
					and were to clutch it eagerly with both hands<br />
					and set it gladly on the brow, -<br />
					even so do these young men<br />
					who, for belief's sake,<br />
					go forth ...<br />
					established them in what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did that noble pair of Arahats<br />
					rejoice together<br />
					in what each had heard the other say so well.</p>
