					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosala,</a><br />
					with a great train of Almsmen,<br />
					he came to a brahmin village of the Kosalans named Sālā.</p>

					<p class="f4">It came to the ears of the brahmin heads of families in Sālā<br />
					that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					a Sakyan who had gone forth as a Pilgrim from a Sakyan family,<br />
					had come to their village<br />
					in the course of an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala,<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, they heard,<br />
					was the high repute noised abroad concerning the reverend Gotama<br />
					that he was said to be -<br />
					The Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind -,<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches a Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good to go and visit Arahats like him.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the brahmins of Sālā<br />
					went to the Lord and,<br />
					after exchanging civil greetings,<br />
					took their seats to one side, -<br />
					some after salutations,<br />
					some after greetings,<br />
					some with joined palms respectfully outstretched,<br />
					some after mention of their names and family,<br />
					and others again in silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being seated,<br />
					they put this question to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why and wherefore is it that,<br />
					after death,<br />
					at the body's dissolution,<br />
					some creatures come to re-birth in states of suffering<br />
					or woe<br />
					or purgatory,<br />
					while others are reborn in some happy state<br />
					or heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg203"><span class="f2 g"><b>[203]</b></span></a> Because, householders, they walk not in righteousness<br />
					but in wickedness,<br />
					some creatures pass to states of suffering;<br />
					Others because they walk in righteousness and in goodness,<br />
					are reborn in happy states in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This utterance is too condensed<br />
					for us to take it in without explanation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the reverend Gotama be so good as to expand his utterance<br />
					and bring Out its meaning for us?</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen then, sirs,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">So to the attentive brahmins the Lord began:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are three forms of unrighteousness and wickedness for the body;<br />
					four for speech;<br />
					and three for thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards bodily unrighteousness, a man<br />
					(i) may take life, -<br />
					as a hunter with hands bathed in blood,<br />
					given to killing and slaying,<br />
					merciless to living creatures; or<br />
					(ii) may take what is not his, -<br />
					by appropriating to himself<br />
					in thievish fashion<br />
					the belongings of other people<br />
					in village and jungle; or<br />
					(iii) may be a fornicator,<br />
					having intercourse with girls under the charge<br />
					of mother<br />
					or father<br />
					or brother<br />
					or sister<br />
					or relations,<br />
					yes, with girls affianced and plighted,<br />
					and even wearing the very garlands of betrothal.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards unrighteousness of speech, a man<br />
					(i) may be a liar; -<br />
					when cited to give testimony before assembly<br />
					or village-meeting<br />
					or family council<br />
					or royal household<br />
					or his guild,<br />
					he may say that he knows<br />
					when he does not know,<br />
					or that he does not know<br />
					when he does know,<br />
					or that he saw<br />
					when he did not see,<br />
					or that he did not see<br />
					when he did see, -<br />
					deliberately lying<br />
					in the interests either of himself<br />
					or of other people<br />
					or for some trifling gain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or (ii) he may be a slanderer; -<br />
					repeating here<br />
					what he has heard elsewhere<br />
					so as to set one set of people by the ears,<br />
					and repeating elsewhere<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					so as to set another set of people by the ears;<br />
					he is a dissolver of harmony<br />
					and a fomenter of strife;<br />
					discord prompts his utterances,<br />
					discord being his pleasure,<br />
					his <a id="pg204"><span class="f2 g"><b>[204]</b></span></a> joy,<br />
					and his delight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or (iii) he may be bitter of tongue; -<br />
					what he says is rough and harsh,<br />
					hurtful and wounding to others,<br />
					provocative of anger,<br />
					and leading to distraction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or (iv) he may be a tattler, -<br />
					talking out of season,<br />
					without heed to fact,<br />
					always talking of the unprofitable,<br />
					never of the Doctrine,<br />
					never of the Rule,<br />
					but ever of the trivial,<br />
					of the ill-timed,<br />
					of the frivolous,<br />
					of things leading nowhere,<br />
					and unprofitable.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards unrighteousness of thought, a man<br />
					(i) may be covetous,<br />
					coveting other people's gear<br />
					with the yearning that it were all his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or (ii) he may be malevolent<br />
					and wicked of heart, -<br />
					wishing that creatures around him<br />
					might be killed,<br />
					destroyed,<br />
					annihilated,<br />
					or cease to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or (iii) he may be wrong in outlook<br />
					and erroneous in his conceptions, -<br />
					holding that there are no such things as alms<br />
					or sacrifice<br />
					or oblations,<br />
					that there is no such thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of deeds good and bad,<br />
					that there is no such thing<br />
					as this world<br />
					or any other,<br />
					that there are no such things<br />
					as either parents<br />
					or translation elsewhere,<br />
					that there are no such things in the world<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who,<br />
					having trodden the right path<br />
					and walked aright,<br />
					have, of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized this and other worlds<br />
					and made it all known to others too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it is because some creatures walk thus<br />
					not in righteousness<br />
					but in wickedness<br />
					that they pass after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					to re-birth in states of suffering<br />
					or woe<br />
					or purgatory.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Contrariwise, there are three forms of. righteousness and goodness for the body;<br />
					four for speech;<br />
					and three for thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards bodily righteousness, a man<br />
					(i) puts from him all killing<br />
					and abstains from killing anything;<br />
					laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					he lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives,<br />
					(ii) Theft he puts from him and eschews;<br />
					taking from others<br />
					only what is given to him by them,<br />
					he lives an honest life,<br />
					(iii) Putting <a id="pg205"><span class="f2 g"><b>[205]</b></span></a> from him all sensual misconduct,<br />
					he abstains from fornication;<br />
					he has no intercourse with girls under the charge<br />
					of mother<br />
					or father<br />
					or brother<br />
					or sister<br />
					or relations,<br />
					no intercourse with girls affianced and plighted<br />
					and with the garlands of betrothal upon them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards righteousness in speech,<br />
					(i) a man puts lying from him<br />
					and abstains from lies;<br />
					when cited to give testimony before assembly<br />
					or village-meeting<br />
					or family council<br />
					or royal household<br />
					or his guild<br />
					he says that he does not know<br />
					when he does not,<br />
					and that he does know<br />
					when he does,<br />
					says that he did not see<br />
					when he did not see<br />
					and that he saw<br />
					when he did see, -<br />
					never deliberately lying in the interests of himself<br />
					or of other people<br />
					or for some trifling gain,<br />
					(ii) All slander he puts from him<br />
					and from slandering he abstains;<br />
					what he hears here<br />
					he does not repeat elsewhere<br />
					so as to set one set of people by the ears,<br />
					nor does he repeat here<br />
					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					so as to set another set of people by the ears;<br />
					he is a promoter of harmony<br />
					and a restorer of amity,<br />
					for concord is his pleasure,<br />
					his joy,<br />
					and his delight,<br />
					(iii) There is no bitterness in his tongue<br />
					and he abstains from bitter speech;<br />
					what he says is without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					hearty,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) No tattler,<br />
					he abstains from tattle,<br />
					speaking in season,<br />
					according to fact,<br />
					always of the profitable,<br />
					of the Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					in speech which is seasonable and memorable,<br />
					illuminating,<br />
					well-marshalled,<br />
					and of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards righteousness in thoughts,<br />
					(i) a man is devoid of covetousness,<br />
					never coveting other peoples gear<br />
					with the yearning that it were all his own.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) He harbours no malevolence<br />
					or wickedness of thought;<br />
					 his wish is that creatures around him<br />
					may live on in peace and happiness,<br />
					safe from all enmity and oppression.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) He is right in outlook<br />
					and correct in his conceptions;<br />
					he affirms that there are indeed such things as alms,<br />
					sacrifice,<br />
					and oblations, -<br />
					as the fruit and harvest of deeds<br />
					good and bad, -<br />
					as this and other <a id="pg206"><span class="f2 g"><b>[206]</b></span></a> worlds, -<br />
					as parents<br />
					and translation elsewhere -<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who,<br />
					having trodden the right path<br />
					and walked aright,<br />
					have, of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized this and other worlds<br />
					and made it all known to others too.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because some creatures<br />
					walk thus in righteousness and goodness<br />
					that they pass after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					to re-birth in some happy state in heaven.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">If the desire of a righteous and good man<br />
					be to be reborn after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					as a great noble,<br />
					this may very well come to pass, -<br />
					because of his righteousness and goodness here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, if such be his desire,<br />
					he might become a magnate among brahmins or heads of houses, -<br />
					because of his righteousness and goodness here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, if such be his desire,<br />
					he might be reborn among the Four Regents,<br />
					or the Thirty-three gods,<br />
					or the Yamas,<br />
					or the Tusitas,<br />
					or the Nimmānaratis,<br />
					or the Paranimmita-vasavattis,<br />
					the Corporeal Brahmās,<br />
					the Ābhās,<br />
					the Paritt-ābhās,<br />
					the Appamāṇa-subhas,<br />
					the Subha-kiṇṇas,<br />
					the Vehapphalas,<br />
					the Avihas,<br />
					the Atappas,<br />
					the Sudassas,<br />
					the Sudassis,<br />
					the Akanitthas,<br />
					the gods of Infinity of Space,<br />
					the gods of Infinity of Mind,<br />
					the gods of the Realm of Naught,<br />
					the gods of the Realm of Neither Perception nor Non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, if it be the righteous and good man's desire,<br />
					by extirpating the Cankers,<br />
					here and now to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					where no Cankers are,<br />
					a Deliverance which he,<br />
					of and by himself,<br />
					has comprehended and realized, -<br />
					then it may well be<br />
					that to such Deliverance<br />
					he will come;<br />
					and all because of his righteousness and goodness here.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the close of this discourse,<br />
					the brahmin householders of Sālā said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, Gotama;<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness,<br />
					so that those with eyes to see might <a id="pg207"><span class="f2 g"><b>[207]</b></span></a> discern the things about them; -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">We come to him as our refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">We ask the reverend Gotama to accept us<br />
					as followers who have found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life lasts.</p>
