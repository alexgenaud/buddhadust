					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					a number of Almsmen,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went early in the day into the city for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, thinking it somewhat early for this,<br />
					they thought they would go to the (neighbouring) pleasaunce<br />
					assigned to the Wanderers of other creeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arrived there<br />
					and seating themselves after due exchange of civil greetings,<br />
					they were addressed as follows by these sectaries:</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sirs, the recluse Gotama teaches how to transcend pleasures of sense; -<br />
					so do we.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches how to transcend visible forms; -<br />
					so do we.</p>

					<p class="f4">He teaches how to transcend feelings; -<br />
					so do we.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where then is the distinction,<br />
					divergence<br />
					or difference<br />
					between him and us<br />
					in tenets or teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsmen who had listened to this,<br />
					neither applauded nor objected,<br />
					but simply rose up without a word<br />
					and departed,<br />
					to hear the truth on the matter<br />
					from the Lord's lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, when they had gone their rounds for alms<br />
					and had got back after their meal,<br />
					they went to him<br />
					and, seating themselves after due salutations,<br />
					related what had passed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sectaries who say that<br />
					should be asked what satisfaction,<br />
					what perils,<br />
					and what Deliverance<br />
					attend pleasures of sense,<br />
					or visible forms,<br />
					or feelings,<br />
					respectively.</p>

					<p class="f4">To this they will not succeed in replying,<br />
					and will be annoyed to boot.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because it is beyond their scope.</p>

					<p class="f4">I see no one in the whole universe -<br />
					with all its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					gods and men -<br />
					who can win hearts with his answer to these questions,<br />
					save only a Truth-finder,<br />
					or a disciple of the Truth-finder,<br />
					or one who has been told by them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction<br />
					that attends pleasures of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">Fivefold are pleasures of sense:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i.) forms <a id="pg60"><span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span></a> perceived by the eye,<br />
					(ii.) sounds perceived by the ear,<br />
					(iii.) odours perceived by the nose,<br />
					(iv.) tastes perceived by the tongue, and<br />
					(v.) touch perceived by the body, -</p>

					<p class="f4">all of them desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					and attractive,<br />
					all of them pleasurable and exciting to passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The satisfaction that attends pleasures of sense<br />
					is the gratification and contentment<br />
					which arises from these fivefold pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the perils<br />
					which attend pleasures of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a respectable young man<br />
					who makes his living by being clerk of the signet,<br />
					clerk of accompt,<br />
					computer,<br />
					estate-agent,<br />
					purveyor,<br />
					herd-manager,<br />
					archer,<br />
					member of the royal household,<br />
					or in some other calling, -<br />
					therein braving heat and cold,<br />
					harassed by gnats,<br />
					mosquitoes,<br />
					wind,<br />
					blazing sun,<br />
					and contact with snakes,<br />
					and tormented to death by hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils<br />
					that attend pleasures of sense,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					with all that makes up the sum of Ill, -<br />
					all because of pleasure,<br />
					from pleasure,<br />
					by reason of pleasure,<br />
					verily with pleasure,<br />
					and pleasure only,<br />
					as the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, now, active,<br />
					energetic<br />
					and pushing though he be,<br />
					this respectable young man fails to make his fortune,<br />
					he grieves<br />
					and laments<br />
					and weeps,<br />
					beats his breast<br />
					and is distracted<br />
					that his efforts have been in vain<br />
					and his activities fruitless.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils that attend ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">If on the other hand<br />
					success attends his efforts<br />
					and he does make his fortune,<br />
					he is beset by anxiety<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					to retain it, -<br />
					always wondering whether kings<br />
					or thieves<br />
					will despoil him,<br />
					or whether he will be stripped<br />
					by fire<br />
					or flood<br />
					or by heirs he detests.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if, despite all his watch and ward,<br />
					one or other of these calamities befalls him,<br />
					then he grieves and laments ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is equally because of pleasure -<br />
					from pleasure,<br />
					by reason of pleasure;<br />
					verily with pleasure,<br />
					and pleasure only,<br />
					as the originating cause -<br />
					that kings contend with kings,<br />
					nobles with nobles,<br />
					brahmins with brahmins,<br />
					citizens with citizens,<br />
					mother with son,<br />
					son with mother,<br />
					<a id="pg61"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6l]</b></span></a> father with son,<br />
					son with father,<br />
					brother with brother,<br />
					brother with sister,<br />
					sister with brother,<br />
					friend with friend,<br />
					till, in their quarrels,<br />
					contentions<br />
					and strife,<br />
					they fall on one another with fists,<br />
					clods,<br />
					cudgels,<br />
					and knives,<br />
					whereby they come by their death<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils that attend ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is equally because of pleasure<br />
					that, girding on sword and buckler,<br />
					bow and sheaf of arrows,<br />
					men charge in battle array,<br />
					while arrows and javelins hurtle through the air<br />
					and swords flash and hack;<br />
					with arrows and spear<br />
					they deal wounds,<br />
					with their swords<br />
					they hew off heads,<br />
					so that men come by their deaths<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils that attend ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is equally because of pleasure<br />
					that, girding on sword and buckler,<br />
					bow and sheaf of arrows,<br />
					men charge up slippery bastions,<br />
					while arrows and javelins<br />
					hurtle through the air <br />
					and swords flash and hack;<br />
					with arrows and spear<br />
					they deal wounds;<br />
					(the besieged) pour down blazing embers<br />
					(on their besiegers)<br />
					and crush them with the falling portcullis;<br />
					heads are hewn off by swords;<br />
					so that men come by their deaths<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is equally because of pleasure<br />
					that men turn into burglars,<br />
					robbers,<br />
					brigands,<br />
					highwaymen,<br />
					or adulterers.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrest, these are punished by the authorities<br />
					in divers ways, -<br />
					by flogging,<br />
					by bastinado,<br />
					by bludgeoning;<br />
					by cutting off hands or feet,<br />
					hands and feet,<br />
					ears or nose,<br />

					or they are sprayed with boiling oil,<br />
					or are given to starved dogs to devour,<br />
					or are impaled alive,<br />
					or have their heads chopped off;<br />
					so that men come by their deaths<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are among the perils ... the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, it is equally because of pleasure -<br />
					from pleasure,<br />
					by reason of pleasure,<br />
					verily with pleasure,<br />
					and pleasure only,<br />
					as the cause -<br />
					that men go astray<br />
					in act<br />
					word<br />
					and thought;<br />
					and thereby, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					they pass to states of suffering,<br />
					woe<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the perils that -<br />
					in the hereafter -<br />
					dog pleasures of sense<br />
					with all that makes up Ill, -<br />
					all because of pleasure,<br />
					from pleasure,<br />
					by reason of pleasure,<br />
					verily with pleasure,<br />
					and pleasure only,<br />
					as the cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what is the deliverance<br />
					from pleasures of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">To subdue<br />
					and to shed<br />
					all desire and appetite for them,<br />
					this is deliverance<br />
					from pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen, if recluses or brahmins<br />
					lack this real knowledge<br />
					of the true nature<br />
					of the satisfaction and perils of,<br />
					and of deliverance from,<br />
					pleasures of sense,<br />
					they cannot possibly either comprehend such pleasures <a id="pg63"><span class="f2 g"><b>[63]</b></span></a> for themselves<br />
					or instruct another<br />
					by what course<br />
					to comprehend the truth about them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only those can possibly do this<br />
					who know pleasures of sense<br />
					for what they truly are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take (the particular case of) visible forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the satisfaction they give?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if there were a maiden<br />
					of a noble<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or citizen family,<br />
					between fifteen and sixteen years old,<br />
					not too tall<br />
					and not too short,<br />
					not too plump<br />
					and not too thin,<br />
					not too dark<br />
					and not too pale; -<br />
					is she then in the flower of her charm and beauty?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, anything agreeable and pleasurable<br />
					that arises from charm and beauty<br />
					is the satisfaction that visible forms give.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what are the perils of visible forms?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose that, later on,<br />
					one saw that same lady<br />
					when she was eighty<br />
					or ninety<br />
					or a hundred years old,<br />
					a crone bent double<br />
					and propping her bowed frame<br />
					with a staff<br />
					as she totters along,<br />
					decrepit,<br />
					with her youth gone<br />
					and her teeth broken,<br />
					with hair grey<br />
					or scanty<br />
					or none,<br />
					all wrinkly or blotchy; -<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the flower of her charm and beauty gone<br />
					and calamity set in?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, this is among the perils<br />
					which dog visible forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose one saw that same lady<br />
					sick<br />
					and suffering<br />
					and very ill,<br />
					lying in her own ordure and urine,<br />
					dependent on others<br />
					to lift and dress her; -<br />
					what think you, Brethren?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the flower of her charm and beauty gone<br />
					and calamity set in?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, this too is among the perils<br />
					which dog visible forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, suppose that,<br />
					after that same lady's body<br />
					has been cast into the charnel-ground,<br />
					one saw it either lying there<br />
					bloated<br />
					and black<br />
					and festering<br />
					after one to three days' exposure there, -<br />
					or being devoured by crows<br />
					or hawks<br />
					or vultures<br />
					or dogs<br />
					or jackals<br />
					or divers worms -<br />
					or showing as a chain <a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> of bones,<br />
					either still with flesh and blood and sinews<br />
					to hold them together,<br />
					or with only smears of flesh and blood left<br />
					with the bones and sinews,<br />
					or with sinews gone<br />
					and only the bare bones left<br />
					scattered about,<br />
					here a hand<br />
					and there a foot,<br />
					here a leg<br />
					and there an arm,<br />
					here the pelvis,<br />
					there the spine,<br />
					and there the skull -<br />
					or with the bones whitening like sea-shells,<br />
					or piled in a heap<br />
					as years roll by,<br />
					or crumbled to dust; -<br />
					what think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has the flower of her charm and beauty gone<br />
					and calamity set in?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, these things too<br />
					are among the perils<br />
					which dog visible forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what is the deliverance<br />
					from visible forms?</p>

					<p class="f4">To subdue<br />
					and shed<br />
					all desire<br />
					and appetite<br />
					for them, -<br />
					this is deliverance<br />
					from visible forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen, if recluses or brahmins<br />

					and deliverance from,<br />
					visible forms,<br />
					they cannot possibly either comprehend visible forms for themselves<br />

					by what course<br />
					to comprehend the truth about them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only those can possibly do this<br />
					who know visible forms<br />
					for what they truly are.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the satisfactions<br />
					that feelings bring?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					has entered on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">When it is thus with him,<br />
					harm is not in his heart,<br />
					either towards himself<br />
					or to others<br />
					or towards both together;<br />
					he experiences the feeling<br />
					of harbouring no harm at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">This perfect innocence of harm<br />
					I count as the true satisfaction<br />
					which feelings bring.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has risen above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters into<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the Second Ecstasy,<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all reasoning and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns <a id="pg65"><span class="f2 g"><b>[65]</b></span></a> within.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so he passes to the Third and the Fourth Ecstasy;<br />
					and when,<br />
					by putting from him<br />
					both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					that Almsman enters into<br />
					and abides in<br />
					that Fourth Ecstasy -<br />
					the state that knows neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant,<br />
					the clarity that comes of poised equanimity<br />
					and alert mindfulness, -<br />
					harm is not in his heart,<br />
					either towards himself<br />
					or to others<br />
					or to both together;<br />
					he experiences the feeling<br />
					of harbouring no harm at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">This sense of perfect innocence of harm<br />
					I count as the true satisfaction<br />
					which feelings bring.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the perils<br />
					which feelings entail?</p>

					<p class="f4">Inasmuch as feelings are transitory,<br />
					fraught with Ill,<br />
					and the creatures of change, -<br />
					these are the perils which dog them.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the deliverance<br />

					<p class="f4">To subdue<br />

						<div class="floatrpp wpx408 marl6">
							<p class="f2"><b>SBE XXXV, Pg. 276 <i>ff.</i>:</b> Painful is the fear produced by despots, or by robbers, or by enemies, or by famine, or by fire, or by flood, or by the tidal wave, or by earthquake, or by crocodiles or alligators. Painful is the fear of possible blame attaching to oneself, or to others, the fear of punishment, the fear of misfortune. Painful is the fear arising from shyness in the presence of assemblies of one's fellows, painful is anxiety as to one's means of livelihood, painful the foreboding of death. [197] Painful are (the punishments inflicted on criminals), such as being flogged with whips, or with sticks, or with split rods, having one's hands cut off, or one's feet, or one's hands and feet, or one's ears, or one's nose, or one's ears and nose. Painful are (the tortures inflicted on traitors)--being subjected to the Gruel Pot (that is, having boiling gruel poured into one's head from the top of which the skull bone has been removed 1)--or to the Chank Crown 2 (that is, having the scalp rubbed with gravel till it becomes smooth like a polished shell)--or to the Râhu's Mouth 3 (that is, having one's mouth held open by iron pins, and oil put in it, and a wick lighted therein)--or to the Fire Garland 4 or to the Hand Torch 5, (that is, being made a living torch, the whole body, or the arms only, being wrapped up in oily cloths, and set on fire)--or to the Snake Strips 6 (that is, being skinned in strips from the neck to the hips, so that the skin falls in strips round the legs)or to the Bark Dress 7 (that is, being skinned alive from the neck downwards, and having each strip of [p. 277]  skin as soon as removed tied to the hair, so that these strips form a veil around one)--or to the Spotted Antelope 1 (that is, having one's knees and elbows tied together, and being made to squat on a plate of iron under which a fire is lit)--or to the Flesh-hooks 2 (that is, being hung up on a row of iron hooks)--or to the Pennies 3 (that is, having bits cut out of the flesh, all over the body, of the size of pennies)--or to the Brine Slits 4 (that is, having cuts made all over one's body by means of knives or sharp points, and then having salt and caustic liquids poured over the wounds)--or to the Bar Turn 5 (that is, being transfixed to the ground by a bar of iron passing through the root of the ear, and then being dragged round and round by the leg)--or to the Straw Seat 6 (that is, being so beaten with clubs that [p. 278] the bones are broken, and the body becomes like a heap of straw)--or to be anointed with boiling oil, or to be eaten by dogs, or to be impaled alive, or to be beheaded. Such and such, O king, are the manifold and various pains which a being caught in the whirlpool of births and rebirths has to endure. just, O king, as the water rained down upon the Himâlaya mountain flows, in its course along the Ganges, through and over rocks and pebbles and gravel, whirlpools and eddies and rapids 1, and the stumps and branches of trees which obstruct and oppose its passage,--just so has each being caught in the succession of births and rebirths to endure such and such manifold and various pains. Full of pain, then, is the continual succession of rebirths, a joy is it when that succession ends. And it was in pointing out the advantage of that end, the disaster involved in that succession, that the Blessed One, great king, instigated us to get beyond birth, and old age, and disease, and death by the realisation of the final end of that succession of rebirths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> From the neck downwards, the skin was flayed into strips not severed at the ankles but there plaited like a hay-band to suspend him till he fell by his own weight. In the next torture the strips formed a kilt.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The victim was skewered to the ground through elbows and knees, with a fire lighted all round him so as to char his flesh.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The victims were slung up by double hooks through flesh and tendons.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> With a razor little discs of flesh were shaved off all over the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Into gashes salt or alkali was rubbed, - with combs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The head was nailed to the ground by a skewer through both ear-holes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> The skin being left intact, the bones and inwards were pounded till the whole frame was as soft as a straw mattress.</p>
