					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_angas">Anga</a> country across the river where there is a township named Āpaṇa,<br />
					he went early in the day,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into town for alms;<br />
					and, after his meal,<br />
					on his way back from his round,<br />
					went into a wood to rest under a tree<br />
					during the heat of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thither too, in the course of his walk,<br />
					came the householder Potaliya,<br />
					in full attire of long tunic and long cloak,<br />
					with umbrella and sandals;<br />
					and after courteous greetings<br />
					stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he stood there,<br />
					the Lord said to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There is sitting room, householder;<br />
					be seated, if you will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indignant and angry at being styled a householder,<br />
					Potaliya made no answer;<br />
					nor did he answer when the Lord repeated his invitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when so invited by the Lord for the third time,<br />
					the indignant and angry Potaliya<br />
					rejoined that <a id="pt360" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg360"><span class="f2">[360]</span></a> it was neither seemly nor proper<br />
					to address him thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, householder,<br />
					you have all the indications<br />
					and characteristics<br />
					and marks<br />
					of a householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Gotama, I have retired<br />
					and given over.</p>

					<p class="f4">How have you managed that, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, I have handed over to my sons<br />
					as their inheritance<br />
					all my wealth and substance,<br />
					all my gold and coins of silver, -<br />
					in connexion with which<br />
					I no longer issue orders<br />
					what to do<br />
					and what not to do,<br />
					but get just my food and clothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how I have retired<br />
					and given over.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a difference, householder,<br />
					between what <a id="pg260"><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></a> you call giving over<br />
					and the giving-up<br />
					under the Law of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, pray, is that giving-up?</p>

					<p class="f4">Will the Lord be so good as to expound it to me?</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken, then, householder,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will tell you,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					who then spoke as follows<br />
					to the listening Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Law of the Noble,<br />
					there are eight states of consciousness<br />
					which conduce to giving up<br />
					according to the Law of the Noble;<br />
					and these are the eight:</p>

					<p class="f4">All killing should be banned<br />
					by holding life sacred;<br />
					theft should be banned<br />
					by never taking what is not a free gift;<br />
					lying should be banned<br />
					by strict adherence to truthfulness;<br />
					calumny should be banned<br />
					by never stooping to calumniate;<br />
					covetise should be banned<br />
					by uncovetousness;<br />
					taunts should be banned<br />
					by never taunting;<br />
					angry rage should be banned<br />
					by placidity;<br />
					and arrogance should be banned<br />
					by humility.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, briefly<br />
					and without detailed exposition,<br />
					are the eight states<br />
					conducing to this giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would you, sir, be so good as to expound these in detail?</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken then, householder,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will tell you,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					who then spoke as follows<br />
					to the listening Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt361" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg361"><span class="f2">[361]</span></a> When I said that all killing should be banned<br />
					by holding life sacred,<br />
					I meant this, namely<br />
					that the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that, as his life now aims at<br />
					putting from him<br />
					and renouncing those Fetters<br />
					which might lead him to take away life,<br />
					he would - were he now to take life -<br />
					not only stand selfcondemned<br />
					but would be censured by men of intelligence,<br />
					and must also,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					look to pass hereafter<br />
					to a state of woe for his guilt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Killing is a Fetter;<br />
					killing is an Obstacle;<br />
					but he whose hands are innocent of blood,<br />
					thereby escapes all the destroying and consuming Cankers<br />
					which blood-guilt would entail.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I meant by saying<br />
					all killing should be banned<br />
					by holding life sacred.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is true of innocence of blood<br />
					is likewise true <a id="pg261"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span></a> in all respects<br />
					of the other seven states of consciousness <a id="pt362" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg362"><span class="f2">[362/3]</span></a>.

					<a id="pt364" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg364"><span class="f2">[364]</span></a> These then, householder,<br />
					are, in detailed exposition,<br />
					the eight states of consciousness,<br />
					at first only briefly indicated by me,<br />
					which, in the Law of the Noble,<br />
					conduce to giving up.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in themselves alone<br />
					they do not make up the plenitude of universal giving-up,<br />
					according to the Law of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">What does make up that plenitude of universal giving-up<br />
					according to the Law of the Noble?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the Lord please explain this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken then, householder,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will tell you,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					who then spoke as follows<br />
					to the listening Potaliya:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. It is just as if a famished, starveling dog<br />
					were to make his way to a slaughter-house<br />
					and the butcher were there to fling him a bare bone, -<br />
					scraped and scraped<br />
					till it was quite clean,<br />
					without a scrap of meat on it<br />
					and with only the merest trace of blood left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that dog be able therewith<br />
					to allay the pangs of his hunger?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir; not with a bare bone like that,<br />
					toil and moil as he may.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that to a bare bone<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense<br />
					with all their present discomforts<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and with worse to follow.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has seen and realized this<br />
					in its full truth,<br />
					then he sheds any equanimity<br />
					which is scattered and diffused<br />
					and develops only that real poise<br />
					which is one-centred and concentrated,<br />
					wherein all attachments to material things of the world<br />
					cease for ever<br />
					and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. It is just as if a vulture<br />
					or heron<br />
					or kite<br />
					were to fly up with a lump of meat<br />
					and other vultures<br />
					and herons<br />
					and kites<br />
					were to keep on attacking it<br />
					to tear and rend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">If the bird does not promptly let go the meat,<br />
					will it not be the death of him<br />
					or deadly hurt to him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that to a lump of meat<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					<a id="pt365" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg365"><span class="f2">[365]</span></a> and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg262"><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></a> 3. It is just as if a man were to carry<br />
					a blazing hay-torch against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">If he does not very quickly drop it,<br />
					will the flame not burn<br />
					either his hand<br />
					or his arm<br />
					or one of his members<br />
					and so bring him death<br />
					or deadly hurt?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that to a hay-torch<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					and none remain.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>two stalwart men: <i>nāma/rūpa.</i> Name and Form result in the Six-Sense-Realms.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">4. It is just as if there were a pit,<br />
					a man's height deep,<br />
					filled with white-hot embers<br />
					showing neither flame nor smoke;<br />
					and a man came along<br />
					who was fond of life<br />
					and did not want to die,<br />
					being fond of pleasure<br />
					and averse from pain;<br />
					and as if two stalwart men<br />
					each took him by an arm<br />
					and dragged him towards the embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not the man<br />
					twist and turn his body<br />
					now this way,<br />
					now that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir;<br />
					because he would realize<br />
					he would be cast into the pit of embers<br />
					and there would come by his death<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that to a pit of embers<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. It is just as if in a dream<br />
					a man were to behold delightful pleasaunces,<br />
					delightful woodlands,<br />
					delightful prospects,<br />
					and delightful lakes,<br />
					none of which he could see when he awoke.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that to a dream<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. It is just as if,<br />
					having besought the loan of other people's wealth -<br />
					<a id="pt366" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg366"><span class="f2">[366]</span></a> a smart carriage<br />
					and rare jewels and ear-rings -<br />
					a man were to appear<br />
					in all this borrowed splendour and bravery<br />
					in the bazaar,<br />
					making folk say<br />
					he must be a wealthy man,<br />
					for wealthy men employ their wealth like that;<br />
					and then the veritable owners<br />
					were to take back their property from him<br />
					when and where they met him.</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the fellow have had enough<br />
					of change of state?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir;<br />
					for the owners would have taken their property away from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that to a loan<br />
					his <a id="pg263"><span class="f2 g"><b>[263]</b></span></a> Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. It is just as if there were a wood<br />
					near a village or township<br />
					and in it a tree<br />
					laden with ripe and ripening fruit<br />
					but with no fallen fruit<br />
					on the ground beneath;<br />
					and a man came along<br />
					who, being in need,<br />
					search,<br />
					and quest of fruit,<br />
					should enter the wood,<br />
					and see that loaded tree<br />
					with no fruit on the ground beneath,<br />
					and bethink him<br />
					that he could climb trees<br />
					and so might eat his fill<br />
					and also stuff his pouch;<br />
					and if, when he had done so,<br />
					a second man,<br />
					coming on a like errand<br />
					to the same tree<br />
					with a sharp axe,<br />
					were to bethink him that,<br />
					though he could not climb,<br />
					he might fell the tree<br />
					and so eat his fill<br />
					and also stuff his pouch.</p>

					<p class="f4">How think you, householder?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the man up the tree<br />
					climb down very quickly<br />
					lest in its fall<br />
					the tree should crush his hand<br />
					or foot<br />
					or other member,<br />
					with <a id="pt367" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg367"><span class="f2">[367]</span></a> consequent death to him<br />
					or deadly hurt?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that to fruit hanging on a tree<br />
					his Lord has likened pleasures of sense ...<br />
					and none remain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arrived now at this perfection<br />
					of mindfulness and poise,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					recalls to mind<br />
					his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ...<br />
					(etc. as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>)<br />
					... in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arrived now at this perfection of mindfulness and poise,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble,<br />
					with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and re-appearing elsewhere ...<br />
					(etc. as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>)<br />
					... in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arrived now at this perfection of mindfulness and poise,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble,<br />
					by eradicating the Cankers,<br />
					here and now, enters into,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Deliverance of heart and mind,<br />
					which knows no Cankers,<br />
					and which, for and by himself,<br />
					he has discerned and realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus, householder,<br />
					there comes about the plenitude of universal giving-up,<br />
					according to the Law of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you detect this in your own case?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a> Who am I, sir,<br />
					by the side of this plenitude of universal giving-up,<br />
					according to the Law of the Noble?</p>

					<p class="f4">Far, far am I from that!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hitherto, sir, I had imagined that the Wanderers of other creeds,<br />
					inferior though they are,<br />
					were superior;<br />
					I fed them,<br />
					inferior though they are,<br />
					on superior food;<br />
					and set them,<br />
					inferior though they are,<br />
					in the superior place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hitherto, I had imagined<br />
					that the superiors were inferior;<br />
					fed them,<br />
					superior though they are,<br />
					on inferior food;<br />
					and set them,<br />
					superior though they are,<br />
					in the inferior place.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now, sir, I shall recognize <a id="pt368" href="../../pali/mn/mn.054.pali.bd.htm#pg368"><span class="f2">[368]</span></a> that the Wanderers of other creeds<br />
					are the inferiors which they are;<br />
					I will feed them,<br />
					as being inferiors,<br />
					on inferior food;<br />
					and I will set them,<br />
					as being inferiors,<br />
					in the inferior place.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsmen, on the other hand,<br />
					I shall now recognize<br />
					as the superiors which they are;<br />
					I will feed them,<br />
					as superiors,<br />
					on superior food;<br />
					and I will set them,<br />
					as superiors,<br />
					in the superior place.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has inspired me<br />
					with love for the Recluses,<br />
					with belief in the Recluses,<br />
					and with reverence for the Recluses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, sir; excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has the Lord made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to the Lord as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the Lord to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward<br />
					while life lasts.</p>
