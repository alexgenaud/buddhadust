					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in Boar's Cave<br />
					on Vulture Peak<br />
					at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					the Wanderer Dīghanakha came to him<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his stand to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">All<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> fails to satisfy me;<br />
					that is what I say,<br />
					and that is the view I hold.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you say, Aggivessana,<br />
					that all fails to satisfy you,<br />
					does your own view<br />
					as just expressed<br />
					also fail to satisfy you?</p>

					<p class="f4">If it did satisfy me,<br />
					then all else would follow suit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt498" href="../../pali/mn/mn.074.pali.bd.htm#pg498"><span class="f2">[498]</span></a> In one class,<br />
					there are very many people in the world<br />
					who, admitting that all else should follow suit,<br />
					yet refuse to discard their old view<br />
					while adopting another.</p>

					<p class="f4">In another class,<br />
					there are very few who,<br />
					admitting that all else should follow suit,<br />
					discard their old view<br />
					and do not tack on another.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmins, Aggivessana,<br />
					who affirm and hold that all satisfies them,<br />
					while others take the contrary view,<br />
					and others again partly take the former<br />
					and partly the latter view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who are satisfied with all,<br />
					hold a view which is allied to passion,<br />
					to bondage,<br />
					to pleasure,<br />
					to attachments<br />
					and to all that sustains continuing existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who are dissatisfied with all,<br />
					hold a view which is allied to passionlessness<br />
					and freedom,<br />
					aloof from pleasure and attachments,<br />
					and with nothing to keep existence continuing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg352"><span class="f2 g"><b>[352]</b></span></a> Here Dīghanakha intervened to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Gotama is complimentary,<br />
					most complimentary to the view I hold!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, the Lord went on to say,<br />
					those who are partly satisfied<br />
					and partly dissatisfied,<br />
					hold a view which,<br />
					so far as it is one of satisfaction,<br />
					is allied to passion and so forth,<br />
					while, so far as it is one of dissatisfaction,<br />
					is allied to passionlessness and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these circumstances<br />
					an intelligent person would say that,<br />
					if he whole-heartedly stuck to<br />
					and disseminated<br />
					the satisfied view<br />
					as wholly and exclusively true,<br />
					he would be at issue with both the other camps,<br />
					which would lead to disputes,<br />
					and so to vexation<br />
					and so to trouble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, he discards this view<br />
					and takes up with no other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same happens to an intelligent person<br />
					with regard to both the dissatisfied<br />
					and the partly-satisfied views,<br />
					so that in all three cases alike<br />
					there is a discarding<br />
					and a renouncing of these views<br />
					by the intelligent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt500" href="../../pali/mn/mn.074.pali.bd.htm#pg500"><span class="f2">[500]</span></a> This body -<br />
					which has visible shape,<br />
					which is made up of the four primary elements,<br />
					starts from parents,<br />
					is sustained by victuals,<br />
					is transitory<br />
					and subject to attrition,<br />
					abrasion,<br />
					dissolution<br />
					and dispersal -,<br />
					this body is to be regarded as transitory,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as a disease,<br />
					as a pustulence,<br />
					as a pang,<br />
					as anguish,<br />
					as a malady,<br />
					as alien,<br />
					as a flux,<br />
					as void,<br />
					as non-self;<br />
					and he who so regards the body,<br />
					loses thereby all liking and affection for a body,<br />
					all subordination to a body.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are the following three classes of feelings, -<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					and neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">While a man is experiencing a pleasant feeling,<br />
					he does not concomitantly experience the unpleasant<br />
					or the neutral,<br />
					but the pleasant alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, an unpleasant or a neutral feeling<br />
					is not concomitant with either of the two other classes.</p>

					<p class="f4">All three classes alike<br />
					have this in common<br />
					that they are transitory,<br />
					that they are products and effects,<br />
					that they are perishable and evanescent,<br />
					and that they can be purged of passion and stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he sees this clearly,<br />
					a well-informed disciple of the Noble,<br />
					grows aweary of all feelings -<br />
					pleasant, <a id="pg353"><span class="f2 g"><b>[353]</b></span></a> unpleasant<br />
					and neutral -<br />
					and, being aweary,<br />
					purges himself of passion<br />
					and by passionlessness finds Deliverance,<br />
					so that, being Delivered,<br />
					he comes to realize his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction that -<br />
					Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me<br />
					there is no more Of what I have been.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman whose heart is Delivered thus,<br />
					neither concurs nor disputes with anyone;<br />
					he employs the current phraseology of the world<br />
					without accepting its ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point there came to the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					who was <a id="pt501" href="../../pali/mn/mn.074.pali.bd.htm#pg501"><span class="f2">[501]</span></a> standing behind the Lord fanning him,<br />
					the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">These then are the several states of consciousness<br />
					which the Lord has bidden us realize and discard,<br />
					which the Blessed One has bidden us renounce.</p>

					<p class="f4">And even as Sāriputta so reflected,<br />
					his heart was Delivered from Cankers<br />
					by leaving nothing to sustain them in being.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Wanderer Dīghanakha, on the other hand,<br />
					there arose the pure and stainless Eye of Truth,<br />
					whereby he saw that in whatsoever has a beginning,<br />
					cessation is also inherent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing and grasping the Doctrine,<br />
					comprehending and fathoming it,<br />
					Dīghanakha -<br />
					with doubts all gone,<br />
					freed from all questionings of heart,<br />
					strong now in confidence,<br />
					personally and independently assured of the Master's gospel -<br />
					said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					quite wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again ...<br />
					(etc. as at end of <a href="mn.072.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 72</a>)<br />
					... as a disciple from this day forth while life lasts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This Sutta is referred to as <i>Vedanā-pariggaha-suttanta</i> at p. 96 of the first volume of the Commentary on the Dhamma-pada (<i>P.T.S.</i> 1906).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Bu.</i> explains <i>sabbaɱ</i> (all, everything) as meaning re-birth and transmigration, in the mouth of Dīghanakha, who, subsequently perceiving that Gotama is using the word in its literal sense, tries to safeguard his original contention.</p>
