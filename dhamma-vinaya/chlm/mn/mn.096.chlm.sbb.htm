					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the brahmin Esukārī came to the Lord,<br />
					by whom he took his seat<br />
					after exchange of the greetings of friendliness and civility,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Service, Gotama,<br />
					is divided into four by brahmins, -<br />
					service of a brahmin,<br />
					service of a noble,<br />
					service of a middle-class man,<br />
					and service of a peasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Any member of all four classes<br />
					may serve a brahmin;<br />
					<a id="pt178" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg178"><span class="f2">[178]</span></a> a noble may be served by another noble<br />
					or by a middle-class man<br />
					or by a peasant;<br />
					a middle-class man may be served<br />
					by another middle-dass man<br />
					or by a peasant;<br />
					while a peasant may be served<br />
					only by a peasant, -<br />
					for who else could?</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the reverend Gotama say hereon?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the whole world<br />
					in accord with brahmins<br />
					in their fourfold division of service?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg101"><span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span></a> It is just like a poor, needy and destitute wretch<br />
					for whom folk should reserve<br />
					a joint he does not want,<br />
					telling him he has got to have it -<br />
					and to pay for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					it is without the assent of recluses and brahmins<br />
					that brahmins lay down the law about service.</p>

					<p class="f4">For myself,<br />
					I neither assert<br />
					that all service is to be rendered<br />
					nor that all service is to be refused.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the service makes a man bad<br />
					and not good,<br />
					it should not be rendered;<br />
					but if it makes him better<br />
					and not bad,<br />
					then it should be rendered.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the guiding consideration<br />
					which should decide the conduct alike of nobles,<br />
					<a id="pt179" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg179"><span class="f2">[179]</span></a> of brahmins,<br />
					of middle-class men<br />
					and of peasants;<br />
					each individual should refuse service<br />
					which makes him bad<br />
					and should accept only the service<br />
					which makes him a better man.</p>

					<p class="f4">I assert that lineage<br />
					does not enter into<br />
					a man's being either good or bad;<br />
					- nor do good looks or wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, you will find a man of noble birth<br />
					who is a murderer,<br />
					a thief,<br />
					a fornicator,<br />
					a liar,<br />
					a slanderer,<br />
					a man of bitter tongue,<br />
					a tattler,<br />
					a covetous person,<br />
					a man of rancour or of wrong views;<br />
					and therefore I assert<br />
					that noble birth<br />
					does not make a good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or again you will find a man of noble birth<br />
					who is innocent of all these vices;<br />
					- and therefore I assert<br />
					that it is not lineage<br />
					which makes a man bad.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, it is not good looks or wealth<br />
					which make a man either good or bad; -<br />
					and therefore I assert<br />
					that neither good looks nor wealth<br />
					make him either good or bad.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt180" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg180"><span class="f2">[180]</span></a> I neither assert<br />
					that all service is to be rendered<br />
					nor that all service is to be refused.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the service rendered<br />
					breeds faith and virtue in a man,<br />
					increases his store of information,<br />
					leads to Renunciation,<br />
					enriches his understanding, -<br />
					that, I assert,<br />
					is service which may be rendered.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point the brahmin Esukārī said to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmins give a fourfold classification of income, -<br />
					from alms, for brahmins;<br />
					from his bow and arrows, for the noble;<br />
					from ploughing and tending cattle,<br />
					for the middle-class man;<br />
					and for the peasant,<br />
					by the carriage of crops<br />
					on the pole slung over his shoulder.</p>

					<p class="f4">If any one of these<br />
					deserts his vocation for something else<br />
					he <a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a> does what he should not do, -<br />
					not less than a guardian<br />
					who appropriates what is not his. -</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the reverend Gotama say on this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the whole world in accord<br />
					with this brahmin classification?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt181" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg181"><span class="f2">[181]</span></a> No.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a poor,<br />
					needy and destitute wretch<br />
					for whom folk should reserve<br />
					a joint he does not want,<br />
					telling him he has got to have it -<br />
					and to pay for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					it is without the assent of recluses and brahmins<br />
					that brahmins lay down the law about wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the noble transcendent Doctrine<br />
					which I, brahmin, affirm to be true wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">As against pride of ancestry,<br />
					the station into which a man happens to be born<br />
					determines only his designation -<br />
					be it noble or brahmin or middle-class or peasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a fire is called<br />
					after the material out of which it is kindled,<br />
					and may thus be called either a wood-fire,<br />
					or a chip-fire,<br />
					or a bracken-fire,<br />
					or a cowdung fire, -<br />
					just in the same way<br />
					the noble, transcendent Doctrine, I aver,<br />
					is the source of true wealth for every man,<br />
					birth merely determining his designation<br />
					in one of the four classes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man -<br />
					be he noble or brahmin or what not -<br />
					who goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and, thanks to the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					proclaimed by the Truth-finder,<br />
					abstains from murder,<br />
					theft,<br />
					loose living,<br />
					lying,<br />
					slander,<br />
					reviling,<br />
					tattling,<br />
					covetousness and malevolence,<br />
					gains right views,<br />
					and attains to the causal method<br />
					and to Doctrine and to the right.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt182" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg182"><span class="f2">[182]</span></a> Now, if a man of each class accomplishes this,<br />
					is it only the brahmin -<br />
					and not any one of the three other classes -<br />
					who in this region<br />
					can develop a heart of love<br />
					innocent of all hate and malevolence?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Gotama; all four classes alike can do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exactly so can men of all four classes alike<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and, thanks to the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					proclaimed by the Truth-finder,<br />
					abstains from murder,<br />
					theft,<br />
					loose living,<br />
					lying,<br />
					slander,<br />
					reviling,<br />
					tattling,<br />
					covetousness and malevolence,<br />
					gains right views,<br />
					and attain to the causal method<br />
					and to Doctrine and to the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Can only a brahmin<br />
					take shampooing balls down to the river with him<br />
					and scour off the dust and dirt;<br />
					and can this not be done<br />
					by a noble or a middle-class man or a peasant?</p>

					<p class="f4">No; all the other three classes <a id="pt188" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a> can do so too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exactly so can all four classes alike<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and, thanks to the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					proclaimed by the Truth-finder,<br />
					abstains from murder,<br />
					theft,<br />
					loose living,<br />
					lying,<br />
					slander,<br />
					reviling,<br />
					tattling,<br />
					covetousness and malevolence,<br />
					gains right views,<br />
					and attain to the causal method<br />
					and to Doctrine and to the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a noble, <a id="pg103"><span class="f2 g"><b>[103]</b></span></a> anointed king,<br />
					assembled a hundred men of varied birth<br />
					and were to say to them: -</p>

					<p class="f4">All of you who are nobles or brahmins or of royal birth,<br />
					take kindling wood of sal or pine or sandal or lotus<br />
					and make a blazing fire with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And you that come of low stocks -<br />
					trappers, rush-plaiters, cartwrights and vermin-killers -<br />
					you light your fires with cattle-troughs or hog-troughs or wash-tubs or bits of woodbine.</p>

					<p class="f4">What would happen, do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it be only the fire kindled by the high-born<br />
					which would blaze up with a bright flame<br />
					and serve the purposes of a fire?</p>

					<p class="f4">And would the fire of the low people fail herein?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Gotama; it would be just the same with high and low;<br />
					<a id="pt184" href="../../pali/mn/mn.096.pali.bd.htm#pg184"><span class="f2">[184]</span></a> every fire alike would blaze up<br />
					with the same bright flame<br />
					and equally serve the purposes of a fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Exactly so can all four classes alike<br />
					go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and, thanks to the Doctrine and Rule<br />
					proclaimed by the Truth-finder,<br />
					abstains from murder,<br />
					theft,<br />
					loose living,<br />
					lying,<br />
					slander,<br />
					reviling,<br />
					tattling,<br />
					covetousness and malevolence,<br />
					gains right views,<br />
					and attain to the causal method<br />
					and to Doctrine and to the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the close of these words,<br />
					the brahmin Esukārī said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a disciple<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge,<br />
					from this day forth,<br />
					while life shall last.</p>
