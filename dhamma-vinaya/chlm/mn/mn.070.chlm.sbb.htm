					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#benares">Kāsī</a><br />
					with a large train of Almsmen,<br />
					he addressed them as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">I go without a meal at night<br />
					and find that on this regimen<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I am healthy and well,<br />
					buoyant, hale and hearty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do like me,<br />
					and you too will benefit in the same way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said those Almsmen dutifully.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the course of that alms-pilgrimage through Kāsī,<br />
					the Lord came to a township of theirs called Kīṭāgiri,<br />
					where he stayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resident there, were two Almsmen<br />
					Assaji and Punabbasuka,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					to whom there came a number of Almsmen<br />
					to say that the Lord himself ate no meal at night<br />
					and that the Confraternity were doing the same<br />
					and were hale and well on it;<br />
					and they urged the two to conform to a regimen<br />
					which would suit them too.

					<a id="pt474" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg474"><span class="f2">[474]</span></a> Thereupon Assaji and Punabbasuka made answer<br />
					that they took meals in the evening<br />
					and early in the morning<br />
					and at noon,<br />
					outside prescribed hours,<br />
					and found that on this regimen<br />
					they were healthy and <a id="pg335"><span class="f2 g"><b>[335]</b></span></a> well,<br />
					buoyant,<br />
					hale and hearty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why should they sacrifice to-day for hereafter?</p>

					<p class="f4">They would continue to take meals<br />
					in the evening<br />
					and early in the morning<br />
					and at noon<br />
					outside prescribed hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Failing to win the two over,<br />
					the Almsmen went to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took their seats to one side,<br />
					narrated all that had passed,<br />
					ending up by saying that,<br />
					as they could not prevail with the two,<br />
					they had come to inform the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">He thereupon bade an Almsman to go to the two<br />
					with the message that the Lord desired their presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">On receipt of this message,<br />
					the two dutifully appeared<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took their seats to one side,<br />
					to be asked by him <a id="pt475" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg475"><span class="f2">[475]</span></a> whether what was reported to him was true.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite true, sir; was their answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it in your knowledge, Almsmen,<br />
					that I ever taught that -<br />
					no matter what the feelings a man experiences,<br />
					whether agreeable or disagreeable or neutral -<br />
					his wrong states of consciousness wane<br />
					while his right states wax apace?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it not in your knowledge<br />
					that my teaching has been that<br />
					right and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					depend on the particular feeling experienced;<br />
					that according to the nature of the specific feelings -<br />
					be they agreeable or disagreeable or neutral -<br />
					wrong states of consciousness wax apace<br />
					while right states wane,<br />
					or vice versa?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I had not known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					and apprehended by comprehension<br />
					that, with a given agreeable feeling experienced by a man,<br />
					wrong states of consciousness wax apace<br />
					and right states wane, -<br />
					if I had not this knowledge,<br />
					should I say,<br />
					would it beseem me to say,<br />
					that you should eschew that agreeable feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just because I have that knowledge<br />
					that I <a id="pt476" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg476"><span class="f2">[476]</span></a> bid you eschew it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also, if I had not known,<br />
					seen,<br />
					discerned,<br />
					realized<br />
					and apprehended by comprehension<br />
					that, with a given <a id="pg336"><span class="f2 g"><b>[336]</b></span></a> agreeable feeling experienced by a man,<br />
					wrong states wane<br />
					and right states wax apace, -<br />
					if I had not this knowledge,<br />
					should I say,<br />
					would it beseem me to say,<br />
					that you should develop<br />
					and abide in that agreeable feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just because I have that knowledge<br />
					that I bid you develop it<br />
					and abide therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt477" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg477"><span class="f2">[477]</span></a>	I do not aver<br />
					that all Almsmen alike<br />
					need to toil on with diligence;<br />
					nor do I aver that all Almsmen alike<br />
					have no such need.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those Almsmen who are Arahats,<br />
					in whom the Cankers are dead,<br />
					who have greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have shed their burthen,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					whose bonds are no more,<br />
					who by utter knowledge<br />
					have won Deliverance, -<br />
					of such Almsmen as these<br />
					I do not aver that they need to toil on with diligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they have already achieved<br />
					all that toil can achieve<br />
					and now are incapable of slackness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But of those Almsmen who are still under training<br />
					and have not won their hearts' desire<br />
					but live in earnest yearning<br />
					for that utter peace, -<br />
					of such Almsmen as these<br />
					I do aver that they need to toil on with diligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I do so because the fruit of diligence<br />
					which I can see for such Almsmen<br />
					is that -, in suitable surroundings,<br />
					with a picked circle of good friends,<br />
					and with faculties duly regulated -<br />
					they will surely win<br />
					that for the sake of which young men go forth<br />
					from home to homelessness as Pilgrims<br />
					and will surely reach the goal of the higher life,<br />
					discerning it of and by themselves here and now,<br />
					realizing it,<br />
					developing it<br />
					and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are seven types found in the world:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">(1) he that is Delivered both ways,<br />
					(2) he that is Delivered by intellect,<br />
					(3) he that has fathomed the corporeal,<br />
					(4) he that has come to see,<br />
					(5) he that is Delivered by faith,<br />
					(6) he that lives up to the Doctrine, and<br />
					(7) he that lives up to faith.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg337"><span class="f2 g"><b>[337]</b></span></a><br />
					(i) Delivered both ways is he who<br />
					(a) has reached through the medium of his physical senses<br />
					those tranquil Deliverances which are immaterial<br />
					and transcend all that is material, and<br />
					(b) has destroyed Cankers<br />
					through intellectual vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman I do not say<br />
					that he needs still to toil on with diligence, -<br />
					because he has already achieved<br />
					all that toil can achieve<br />
					and now is incapable of slackness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) Delivered by the intellect is he who,<br />
					though he has not reached<br />
					through the medium of his physical senses<br />
					those tranquil Deliverances<br />
					which are immaterial<br />
					and transcend all that is material,<br />
					has destroyed Cankers<br />
					through intellectual vision.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt478" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg478"><span class="f2">[478]</span></a> Of such an Almsman, too, I do not say<br />
					that he needs still ...<br />
					incapable of slackness.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) He has fathomed the corporeal who<br />
					(a) has reached through the medium of his physical senses<br />
					those tranquil Deliverances<br />
					which are immaterial<br />
					and transcend all that is material, and<br />
					(b) has destroyed some Cankers<br />
					by intellectual vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman I do say<br />
					that he needs still to toil on with diligence, -<br />
					because the fruit of diligence<br />
					which I can see for such an Almsman is that,<br />
					in suitable surroundings,<br />
					with a picked circle of good friends,<br />
					and with faculties duly regulated,<br />
					he will surely win ...<br />
					and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) He has come to see<br />
					who, not having reached these Deliverances<br />
					through the medium of his physical senses,<br />
					has destroyed some Cankers<br />
					by intellectual vision,<br />
					and by intellect has plumbed and fathomed<br />
					those states of consciousness<br />
					which the Truth-finder has preached.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman, too, I do aver<br />
					that he needs still to toil on ...<br />
					and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) Delivered by faith is he who,<br />
					not having reached these Deliverances<br />
					through the medium of his physical senses,<br />
					has destroyed some Cankers<br />
					by intellectual vision,<br />
					but has his faith in the Truth-finder fixed,<br />
					rooted and stablished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman, too, I do aver<br />
					that he needs still to toil on ...<br />
					<a id="pt479" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg479"><span class="f2">[479]</span></a> and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg338"><span class="f2 g"><b>[338]</b></span></a> (vi) He lives up to the Doctrine<br />
					who, having neither reached these Deliverances<br />
					through the medium of his physical senses<br />
					nor destroyed the Cankers,<br />
					has through the intellect<br />
					a message of delight in the states of consciousness<br />
					which the Truth-finder preaches, -<br />
					possessing faith,<br />
					effort,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					rapt concentration<br />
					and understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman, too, I do aver<br />
					that he needs still to toil on ...<br />
					and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vii) Lastly, he lives up to faith<br />
					who, having neither reached these states of Deliverance<br />
					through the medium of his physical senses<br />
					nor destroyed the Cankers,<br />
					just reposes faith and affection in the Truth-finder, -<br />
					possessing faith,<br />
					effort,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					rapt concentration<br />
					and understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman, too, I do aver<br />
					that he needs still to toil on ...<br />
					and abiding therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not say that the plenitude of knowledge<br />
					comes straightaway; -<br />
					it comes by gradual training,<br />
					by gradual attainment<br />
					and by gradual progress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt480" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg480"><span class="f2">[480]</span></a> Take the case of a man with faith<br />
					who first draws near,<br />
					then attends constantly,<br />
					then pays attention,<br />
					then hears the Doctrine,<br />
					then carries it away with him,<br />
					then examines the import<br />
					of the ideas he has carried away,<br />
					then is in an ecstasy of delight over those ideas,<br />
					then grows to ardour,<br />
					is emboldened by his ardour,<br />
					becoming emboldened,<br />
					weighs it all,<br />
					and, weighing it,<br />
					strives,<br />
					till, void of self,<br />
					he, through the medium of his bodily senses,<br />
					realizes the truth sublime<br />
					and by his intellect penetrates it<br />
					and sees it clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had that faith not been there,<br />
					he would not have drawn near,<br />
					nor come again,<br />
					nor would any of the other things have happened,<br />
					nor would he have striven at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen, ye have gone far astray;<br />
					ye have erred grievously.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah, how very far have these foolish persons departed<br />
					from this Doctrine and Rule!</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a fourfold exposition,<br />
					the import of which,<br />
					when it is propounded,<br />
					can speedily be mastered<br />
					by the intellect of a man of intelligence.</p>

					<p class="f4">This I will propound to you<br />
					and you shall understand it from me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg339"><span class="f2 g"><b>[339]</b></span></a> Who, sir, are we?</p>

					<p class="f4">And who are they who know the Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, Almsmen,<br />
					even a master who put store on things material<br />
					who made them his heritage<br />
					and cherished them, -<br />
					even he is not met by higgling and haggling stipulations<br />
					that, if they like a thing,<br />
					his followers will do it,<br />
					but will not do it if they do not like it.</p>

					<p class="f4">How can this chaffering beseem the Truth-flnder<br />
					who dwells wholly apart from things material?</p>

					<p class="f4">To the follower with faith<br />
					and in unison with his Master's teachings,<br />
					it is a principle that the Lord is his Master,<br />
					and he his disciple;<br />
					that the Lord knows<br />
					and he does not.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the follower with faith,<br />
					in unison with his Master's teachings,<br />
					those teachings impart strength and affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the follower with faith,<br />
					in unison with his Master's teachings,<br />
					<a id="pt481" href="../../pali/mn/mn.070.pali.bd.htm#pg481"><span class="f2">[481]</span></a> it is a principle that -<br />
					let only skin and sinews and bone persist<br />
					and let flesh and blood dry up,<br />
					there still shall be no slackening of effort<br />
					till what a man's strength<br />
					and a man's perseverance<br />
					and a man's energy<br />
					can win for him,<br />
					has been won.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the follower with faith,<br />
					in unison with his Master's teachings,<br />
					one of two fruits may be looked for, -<br />
					either Knowledge here and now or -<br />
					if the stuff of life be not wholly spent -<br />
					no return to life on earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
