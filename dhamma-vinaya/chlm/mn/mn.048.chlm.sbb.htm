					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a> in the Ghosita pleasaunce,<br />
					disputes were rife in Kosambī among the Almsmen,<br />
					who were living in a state of uproar and contention,<br />
					hurling taunts at one another; -<br />
					they could not win one another over,<br />
					nor would they themselves be won over,<br />
					to accord and agreement.</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been reported by an Almsman to the Lord,<br />
					he bade an Almsman summon those Almsmen<br />
					in his name<br />
					to his presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had duly come<br />
					and had taken their seats to one side<br />
					after due salutation,<br />
					he asked them whether the report of their disputes was true;<br />
					and, on their admitting it, he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">While you are thus disputing,<br />
					are you instant -<br />
					both overtly and privily -<br />
					in acts and in words and in thoughts<br />
					of goodwill towards your fellows in the higher life?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it comes to this:<br />
					that disputes are rife among you;<br />
					that you are living in a state of uproar and contention,<br />
					hurling taunts at one another;<br />
					and that, meanwhile,<br />
					you are not instant -<br />
					both overtly and privily -<br />
					in acts or words or thoughts<br />
					of goodwill towards your fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, oh what,<br />
					can you know and see,<br />
					you foolish people,<br />
					that you dispute like <a id="pg231"><span class="f2 g"><b>[231]</b></span></a> this<br />
					and never come to accord and agreement?</p>

					<p class="f4">Long will this enure to your hurt and harm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen, there are six states of consciousness -<br />
					the Lord went on to say -<br />
					which, being in themselves endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					conduce to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord,<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) If an Almsman is instant in acts of goodwill -<br />
					both overtly and privily -<br />
					towards his fellows in the higher life, -<br />
					this is a state,<br />
					in itself endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) If he is instant in words of goodwill ...<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) If he is instant in thoughts of goodwill ...<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) If he shares equally<br />
					and without favour<br />
					among all his virtuous fellows in the higher life<br />
					everything given him<br />
					that is lawful and lawfully received,<br />
					down to the last crumb in his bowl, -<br />
					this too is a state,<br />
					in itself endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord,<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) If, both overtly and privily,<br />
					an Almsman lives among his fellows in the higher life<br />
					in the exercise of these virtues,<br />
					in their unbroken entirety,<br />
					and without flaw,<br />
					spot,<br />
					or blemish,<br />
					virtues which bestow freedom,<br />
					are lauded by sages,<br />
					are unmarred (by unworthy motives),<br />
					and conduce to rapt concentration, -<br />
					this too is a state,<br />
					in itself endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord,<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vi) If-both overtly and privily -<br />
					an Almsman lives,<br />
					among his fellows in the higher life,<br />
					seized of the noble and saving creed<br />
					which guides him who lives up to it<br />
					unto the utter destruction of all Ill, -<br />
					this too is a state,<br />
					in itself endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord,<br />
					and unity.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> Such are the six states of consciousness<br />
					which, being in themselves endearing,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					and respectful,<br />
					conduce to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord,<br />
					and unity;<br />
					and of the six<br />
					the roof-tie<br />
					which on high<br />
					knits the six together<br />
					is the possession of the noble and saving creed<br />
					which guides him who lives up to it<br />
					unto the utter destruction of all Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in a gabled palace<br />
					the gable is the roof-tie on high<br />
					which knits the whole structure together, -<br />
					so of these six states of consciousness<br />
					the roof-tie<br />
					which on high<br />
					knits them all together<br />
					is the possession of the noble and saving creed<br />
					which guides him who lives up to it<br />
					unto the utter destruction of all Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does that noble idea affect this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who - in jungle<br />
					or beneath a tree<br />
					or in a home of solitude -<br />
					examines himself to see<br />
					whether he harbours any still lurking predisposition<br />
					which can so predispose his heart<br />
					as to debar him from knowing and discerning<br />
					things as they really are.</p>

					<p class="f4">His heart is so predisposed,<br />
					if he harbours a predisposition<br />
					to a passion for pleasure -<br />
					to malevolence -<br />
					to sloth and torpor -<br />
					to worry -<br />
					to doubt -<br />
					to centring his thoughts on this<br />
					or on other worlds -<br />
					or to living in a state of disputes and uproar,<br />
					contention<br />
					and the hurling of taunts.</p>

					<p class="f4">He emerges convinced<br />
					not only that he harbours no such predisposition<br />
					as would debar him from knowing and discerning<br />
					things as they really are,<br />
					but also that his mind is on the right lines for enlightenment<br />
					in the (Four) Truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first knowledge he wins, -<br />
					a knowledge noble and transcendental,<br />
					not shared by the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself whether,<br />
					by fostering<br />
					and developing<br />
					and enlarging<br />
					this noble and saving creed,<br />
					he is gaining for himself calm<br />
					and gaining peace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he answers;<br />
					I am.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself whether -<br />
					outside -<br />
					there is found any recluse or brahmin<br />
					who has got the noble and saving creed he <a id="pg233"><span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></a> has.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, he answers;<br />
					not one.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself whether he comports himself<br />
					like one who is seized of that noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, one seized thereof,<br />
					should he be guilty of an offence<br />
					which obviously has occurred,<br />
					straightway declares it<br />
					and lays it open and bare<br />
					to his master<br />
					or to sage comrades in the higher life;<br />
					and, having so confessed his offence,<br />
					keeps a watch on himself thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a tiny babe<br />
					that lies helpless on its back<br />
					needs but to touch a live ember<br />
					with foot<br />
					or hand<br />
					in order straightway to draw back the limb, -<br />
					even so one seized of the noble and saving creed,<br />
					should he be guilty ...<br />
					watch on himself thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br />
					that he does comport himself<br />
					like one who is seized of that noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself (anew) whether he comports himself<br />
					like one who is seized of the noble and saving creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, one seized thereof,<br />
					while zealous in the discharge of his several duties -<br />
					great and small -<br />
					towards his comrades in the higher life,<br />
					also has a keen yearning<br />
					to master the higher virtues,<br />
					the higher thinking,<br />
					and the higher love.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a cow with a calf<br />
					always has her eye on her calf<br />
					as she browses, -<br />
					even so one seized of the noble creed,<br />
					while zealous ...<br />
					higher love.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br />
					that he does comport himself<br />
					like one who is seized of that noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself whether his is the strength<br />
					of one seized of the noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the strength of one seized thereof<br />
					consists in recognizing and appreciating,<br />
					when the truth-finder's Doctrine and Law are being preached,<br />
					the import and the significance of the Doctrine,<br />
					with his whole heart and ears absorbed<br />
					in drinking in what he hears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br />
					that he has got the strength<br />
					of one seized of the noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg234"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></a> Again, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					asks himself whether his is the strength<br />
					of one seized of the noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the strength of one seized thereof<br />
					consists in this<br />
					that, when the truth-finder's Doctrine and Law are being preached,<br />
					he takes in knowledge of welfare and of the Doctrine<br />
					and gets the gladness which the Doctrine brings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he comes to know<br />
					that he has got the strength<br />
					of one seized of the noble creed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh knowledge ...<br />
					the vulgar.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way is due examination made<br />
					of the demeanour of a disciple of the Noble<br />
					with his sevenfold endowment,<br />
					for the realizing of conversion's fruits;<br />
					and those fruits appertain to a disciple of the Noble<br />
					with his sevenfold endowment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
