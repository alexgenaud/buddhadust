					<p class="f4">Once the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you know the Five Bonds<br />
					which chain men to the lower life here,<br />
					as taught by me?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, I do, said the reverend Malunkya-putta.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is your knowledge of them?</p>

					<p class="f4">One is views on personality;<br />
					another is doubt;<br />
					another is attachment to observances;<br />
					fourth come lusts of the flesh;<br />
					and the fifth is malevolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">To whom do you hear that I so taught the Five Bonds?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not Wanderers who profess other creeds confute you with the illustration from infancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">For, a new-born babe,<br />
					helpless on its back,<br />
					is not conscious of personality at all,<br />
					<a id="pt433" href="../../pali/mn/mn.064.pali.bd.htm#pg433"><span class="f2">[433]</span></a> much less can it hold views on personality,<br />
					its propensity to views on personality being latent only.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an infant is not conscious of doctrines,<br />
					much less can it have doubts about them,<br />
					its propensity to doubt being latent only.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an infant is not conscious of rules of conduct,<br />
					much less can it be attached to observances,<br />
					its propensity to such attachment being latent only.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an infant is not conscious of lusts of the flesh,<br />
					much less can passion arise within it,<br />
					its sensual propensities being latent only.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an infant is not conscious of fellow-creatures,<br />
					much less can it harbour malevolence towards them,<br />
					its malevolent propensities being latent only.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not Wanderers who profess other creeds confute you, Malunkya-putta,<br />
					with this illustration from infancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point the reverend <i>Ānanda</i> exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now is the time for this, Lord;<br />
					now is the time, Blessed One,<br />
					for the Lord to impart teaching about <a id="pg309"><span class="f2 g"><b>[309]</b></span></a> the Five Bonds,<br />
					to be treasured up from his lips by the Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear then, Ānanda,<br />
					and listen,<br />
					said the Lord;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the listening Ānanda the Lord began:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an uninstructed everyday man,<br />
					who has no vision of the Noble<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their noble doctrine,<br />
					who has no vision of the Excellent<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their excellent doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man's mind is beset and obsessed by delusions about personality;<br />
					he knows no real escape therefrom;<br />
					and these delusions about personality,<br />
					if left to grow in strength,<br />
					are a Bond to chain him to this lower life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same, too,<br />
					happens with doubt -<br />
					with attachment to rites -<br />
					with sensuality -<br />
					<a id="pt434" href="../../pali/mn/mn.064.pali.bd.htm#pg434"><span class="f2">[434]</span></a> and with malevolence;<br />
					all of which are likewise Bonds<br />
					to chain him to this lower life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the Noble -<br />
					who has vision of the Noble and Excellent<br />
					and is versed and trained in noble and excellent doctrine -<br />
					has a mind beset and obsessed by no delusions about personality and the rest of the Five Bonds;<br />
					he knows the real escape therefrom;<br />
					he discards each and all of them,<br />
					with all propensities thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without first treading the path and the course<br />
					for getting rid of these Five Bonds,<br />
					it is quite impossible for a man to know or discern or to get rid of them, -<br />
					any more than it is possible,<br />
					without first cutting away bark and foliage,<br />
					to cut the choice timber<br />
					of a fine upstanding timber-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if he has first trodden the path and the course<br />
					for getting rid of these Five Bonds,<br />
					<a id="pt435" href="../../pali/mn/mn.064.pali.bd.htm#pg435"><span class="f2">[435]</span></a> it is possible for a man to know and discern and get rid of them, -<br />
					just as it is possible,<br />
					after first cutting away bark and foliage,<br />
					to cut the choice timber of the tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a weakling,<br />
					coming to the Ganges in spate,<br />
					and thinking his arms can bear him across in safety to the further shore,<br />
					would fail in the attempt, -<br />
					in just the same case is whosoever fails,<br />
					when the doctrine of <a id="pg310"><span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span></a> stilling personality is being preached,<br />
					to embrace it,<br />
					welcome it,<br />
					cleave to it,<br />
					and stand fast therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the case of such men.</p>

					<p class="f4">But just as a strong man,<br />
					coming to the Ganges in spate<br />
					and thinking his arms can bear him across in safety to the further shore,<br />
					would succeed in the attempt, -<br />
					in just the same case is whosoever succeeds,<br />
					when the doctrine of stilling personality is being preached,<br />
					in embracing it,<br />
					welcoming it,<br />
					cleaving to it,<br />
					and standing fast therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the case of such men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what is the path<br />
					and what is the course<br />
					unto riddance of these Five Bonds<br />
					which chain men to this lower world here?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who,<br />
					by aloofness from all ties,<br />
					by eschewing wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					and by quelling all lewdness of body,<br />
					becomes divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and of wrong states of consciousness<br />
					so that he develops<br />
					and dwells in the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever occurs as a visible shape,<br />
					or feeling,<br />
					or perception,<br />
					or factors of being, -<br />
					all such mental phenomena<br />
					he regards as transitory,<br />
					as Ill,<br />
					as disease,<br />
					as pustulences,<br />
					as pangs,<br />
					as anguish,<br />
					as maladies,<br />
					as extraneous,<br />
					as fleeting,<br />
					as hollow,<br />
					as non-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He purges his mind of all such mental phenomena<br />
					and <a id="pt436" href="../../pali/mn/mn.064.pali.bd.htm#pg436"><span class="f2">[436]</span></a> applies it, so purged,<br />
					to the state which is deathless,<br />
					confident that what is really good and really excellent<br />
					is the stilling of all factors of being,<br />
					riddance from all ties,<br />
					destruction of cravings,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					peace,<br />
					Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">From this platform he attains to the extirpation of the Cankers;<br />
					or, if he does not attain to their definite extirpation,<br />
					yet by his very passion for righteousness<br />
					and by his very delight therein,<br />
					he destroys the Five Bonds which chain him to this lower world here<br />
					so that he will be translated hereafter to realms above,<br />
					from which he will never return to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the path<br />
					and such is the course<br />
					unto riddance of these Five Bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg311"><span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span></a> Rising above observation and reflection,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then follow the Third and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever occurs as a visible shape ...<br />
					riddance of these Five Bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising next altogether beyond perception of the visible,<br />
					by ceasing to perceive sense-reactions,<br />
					and by not heeding perception of differences,<br />
					the Almsman reaches the idea of infinite space<br />
					and so develops, and abides in, the plane of infinite space,<br />
					and, in succession,<br />
					the plane of infinite mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever occurs as a visible shape ...<br />
					<a id="pt437" href="../../pali/mn/mn.064.pali.bd.htm#pg437"><span class="f2">[437]</span></a> riddance of these Five Bonds which chain men to the lower life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this, sir, be the path<br />
					and the course unto riddance of these Five Bonds,<br />
					how comes it that Deliverance is found by some<br />
					through the heart<br />
					and by others through the intellect?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I say it results from difference in their respective faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
