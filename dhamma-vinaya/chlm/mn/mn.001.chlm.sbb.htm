					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Ukkaṭṭhā in the Subhaga grove under the great sāl-tree, he addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will expound to you how all states of consciousness originate;<br />
					listen with attention and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir,<br />
					said they in response to the Lord,<br />
					who then spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed every-day man,<br />
					who takes no count of the Noble<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in Noble Doctrine;<br />
					who takes no count of the Excellent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and is unversed and untrained in Excellent Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man (simply) perceives earth as earth and,<br />
					so perceiving it,<br />
					conceives ideas of earth,<br />
					ideas of -<br />
					in earth,<br />
					from earth,<br />
					my earth; -<br />
					and is content with 'earth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is because he does not comprehend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too he perceives water as water,<br />
					and, so perceiving it,<br />
					conceives ideas of water,<br />
					ideas of -<br />
					in water,<br />
					from water,<br />
					my water; -<br />
					and is content with 'water.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is because he does not comprehend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way originate his ideas about<br />
					(i) fire,<br />
					(2) air,<br />
					(3) creatures,<br />
					(4) gods,<br />
					(5) Pajāpati,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					(6) Brahmā,<br />
					(7) Ābhassara deities,<br />
					(8) Subhakiṇṇa deities,<br />
					(9) Vehapphala deities,<br />
					(10) Abhibhū,<br />
					(11) the Realm of Infinite Space,<br />
					(12) the Realm of Infinite <a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> Mind,<br />
					(13) the Realm of Naught,<br />
					(14) the Realm of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					(15) what is seen,<br />
					(16) what is heard,<br />
					(17) what is sensed,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					(18) what is discerned,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					(19) unity,<br />
					(20) multiplicity,<br />
					(21) universality, and<br />
					(22) Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then too there is the Almsman who is still under training and has not yet won Arahatship,<br />
					but lives in earnest yearning for utter immunity from the four Attachments.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recognizes earth as earth;<br />
					but, having so recognized it, -<br />
					ah! let him not conceive ideas of earth,<br />
					ideas of -<br />
					in earth,<br />
					from earth,<br />
					my earth;<br />
					let him not rest content with 'earth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is because he must bring himself to comprehend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Here follow similar paragraphs about water, fire, air ... etc. . . ., and (22) Nirvana.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Then there is the Almsman who is an Arahat,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in whom the Cankers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> are no more,<br />
					who has greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who has shed his burthens<br />
					and has won his weal,<br />
					whose bonds to life are now no more,<br />
					who by utter knowledge<br />
					has found final Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too recognizes earth as earth;<br />
					but, having so recognized it,<br />
					he conceives no ideas of earth,<br />
					in earth,<br />
					from earth,<br />
					my earth;<br />
					nor does he rest content with 'earth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is because he has come to comprehend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too he recognizes water and the rest of these <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> things;<br />
					he recognizes Nirvana as Nirvana,<br />
					but, having so recognized it,<br />
					he conceives no ideas of Nirvana,<br />
					no ideas of -<br />
					in Nirvana,<br />
					from Nirvana,<br />
					my Nirvana;<br />
					nor does he rest content with 'Nirvana.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is because he has come to comprehend it.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman who is an Arahat,<br />
					in whom ... (etc., as in preceding paragraph, down to) ... nor does he rest content with 'earth,'<br />
					or 'water'<br />
					and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, say I,<br />
					by the extirpation of lusts<br />
					he is freed from lusts;<br />
					because by the extirpation of hate<br />
					he is freed from hate;<br />
					because by the extirpation of delusion<br />
					he is freed from delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> too,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					also recognizes earth as earth;<br />
					but, having so recognized it,<br />
					he conceives no ideas of earth,<br />
					no ideas of -<br />
					in earth,<br />
					from earth,<br />
					my earth;<br />
					nor is he content with 'earth,'<br />
					or with 'water'<br />
					and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, say I,<br />
					he has comprehended it to the full.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder too ... (etc., as in preceding paragraph, down to) ...</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, having seen pleasure<br />
					to be the root of Ill,<br />
					he sees how continuing existence entails rebirths<br />
					and that whatever has continuing existence<br />
					is dogged by decay and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it is, say I,<br />
					that by extirpating all cravings,<br />
					by lusting not after them,<br />
					but by destroying<br />
					and abandoning<br />
					and renouncing them all,<br />
					the Truth-finder has become all-enlightened,<br />
					with utter enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Identified by <i>Bu.</i>  as Māra.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> For the <i>four</i> <i>āsavas</i> (of pleasure, continuing existence, and ignorance, with error superadded), see <i>e.g.</i>  <i>D.</i> II, 84.

					The <i>āsavas,</i> so called (says <i>Bu.</i> ) because they flow, would seem to be running sores, or neoplasms of character, with their metastases of evil, like physical cancers.
