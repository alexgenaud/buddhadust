					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <span class="mozp">Rājagaha</span> in the Bamboo Grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					there were living in the Wanderers' Pleasaunce<br />
					where the peacocks were fed<br />
					a number of most eminent Wanderers,<br />
					- such as Anugāra, Varadhara and Sakuludāyi,<br />
					together with other very well-known Wanderers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord went into Rājagaha for alms;<br />
					but, deeming the hour too early as yet for this,<br />
					he bethought him of going to Sakuludāyi in Wanderers Pleasaunce;<br />
					and thither he repaired.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the time, Sakuludāyi was sitting with his great company of Wanderers,<br />
					who were making a great noise<br />
					with their voices raised and loud<br />
					in all manner of low and beastly talk, -<br />
					about princes,<br />
					bandits,<br />
					great lords' armies,<br />
					terrors,<br />
					battles,<br />
					meats and drinks,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					relations,<br />
					villages,<br />
					townships,<br />
					cities,<br />
					countries,<br />
					women,<br />
					warriors,<br />
					roads,<br />
					wells,<br />
					kinsfolk departed,<br />
					and all the rest of it,<br />
					with chatter about world and ocean,<br />
					and <a id="pt2" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg2"><span class="f2">[2]</span></a> about being and not-being.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">When from some way off Sakuludāyi saw the Lord coming,<br />
					he hushed his company by saying:<br />
					Be quiet, sirs;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					here comes the recluse Gotama,<br />
					who is a lover of silence and commends the silent;<br />
					if he observes silence reigning in this gathering,<br />
					he may decide to approach.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they became silent and the Lord came up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said Sakuludāyi:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">- I pray the Lord to join us;<br />
					he is truly welcome;<br />
					it is a long time since he last managed to come.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pray,<br />
					be seated;<br />
					here is a seat for the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down accordingly,<br />
					asking Sakuludāyi,<br /> 
					who took a low seat to one side,<br />
					what had been their theme<br />
					and what was the discussion<br />
					which had been interrupted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let that pass for the moment,<br />
					answered Sakuludāyi;<br />
					you can easily gather that later on.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of late, when recluses and brahmins of other creeds<br />
					were met together in the Discussion Hall,<br />
					the topic was mooted what a good thing,<br />
					what a very good thing,<br />
					<a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> for the Magadha people in Anga<br />
					that such recluses and brahmins -<br />
					all at the head of confraternities or followings,<br />
					all well-known and famous teachers,<br />
					all founders of saving creeds,<br />
					held in high repute by many people -<br />
					should have come to spend the rainy season at Rājagaha.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">-There was Pūraṇa Kassapa,<br />
					Makkhali Gosāla,<br />
					Ajita Kesa-Kambalī,<br />
					Pakudha Kaccayana,<br />
					Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi-putta, and<br />
					Nāta-putta the Nigaṇṭha, -<br />
					<a id="pt3" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg3"><span class="f2">[3]</span></a> all men of this distinction<br />
					and all of them here for the rains;<br />
					and among them there is also the recluse Gotama here,<br />
					at the head of his confraternity and following,<br />
					a well-known and famous teacher,<br />
					a founder of a saving creed,<br />
					who is held in high repute by many.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, which of these Lords,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					which of these recluses and brahmins<br />
					of such eminence as teachers,<br />
					is esteemed,<br />
					respected,<br />
					venerated<br />
					and adored by his disciples?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And on what terms of esteem and respect<br />
					do they live with him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said some: -<br />
					Pūraṇa Kassapa gets no esteem or respect,<br />
					no veneration or adoration,<br />
					from his disciples;<br />
					they live with him<br />
					on no terms of esteem and respect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Time was when,<br />
					as he was preaching his doctrine to some hundreds of his following,<br />
					a disciple broke in with -<br />
					Don't question Pūraṇa Kassapa,<br />
					who does not know about it;<br />
					ask me who do;<br />
					I will explain everything to your reverences.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With arms outstretched Pūraṇa Kassapa tearfully <a id="remonstrated">remonstrated,</a> saying -<br />
					Do be quiet, sirs;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					the question is addressed not to those persons<br />
					but to me,<br />
					who will explain everything.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But many of his disciples went off<br />
					after riddling his argument.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You, said they,<br />
					know nothing of this Doctrine and Rule;<br />
					we do and you never can;<br />
					you are in error,<br />
					we in the right;<br />
					there is sense in what we say,<br />
					none in what you say;<br />
					you conclude where you should begin,<br />
					and begin with what you should conclude with;<br />
					your rigmarole is <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> exploded;<br />
					your argument is riddled;<br />
					you are refuted;<br />
					go away and learn better<br />
					or else disentangle yourself,<br />
					if you can.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such was the lack of esteem,<br />
					respect,<br />
					veneration,<br />
					and adoration shown to Pūraṇa Kassapa by his disciples,<br />
					who lived with him on no terms of esteem and respect,<br />
					but scoffed at him and his teachings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt4" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg4"><span class="f2">[4]</span></a> Others said ... <i>(precisely the same things about the five other sophists)</i>.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Others again said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the recluse Gotama at the head of his Confraternity and following,<br />
					a well-known and famous teacher,<br />
					a founder of a saving creed,<br />
					who is held in high repute by many.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Him his disciples esteem,<br />
					respect,<br />
					venerate<br />
					and adore;<br />
					and with him they live<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Time was when,<br />
					as the recluse Gotama was preaching his Doctrine<br />
					to some hundreds of his following,<br />
					a disciple coughed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One of his fellows in the higher life<br />
					jogged him with his knee,<br />
					saying: -<br />
					Keep quiet, <a id="pt5" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg5"><span class="f2">[5]</span></a> your reverence;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					our master, the Lord,<br />
					is preaching the Doctrine!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the recluse Gotama is preaching to hundreds at once,<br />
					no hawking or spitting is heard among them;<br />
					the whole assemblage is on the tip-toe of expectancy,<br />
					intent only to hear what he shall say.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man at cross-roads<br />
					pressing out pure, clear honey<br />
					from a small honey-comb<br />
					amid the hopeful expectancy of an encircling crowd, -<br />
					even so, when the recluse Gotama is preaching to hundreds at once,<br />
					no hawking or spitting is heard among them;<br />
					the whole assemblage is on the tip-toe of expectancy,<br />
					intent only to hear what he shall say.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So also when, after a corporate life with their fellows,<br />
					disciples of his throw up their course of training<br />
					and revert to the lower state of the layman, -<br />
					even they laud the Master,<br />
					his Doctrine<br />
					and his Confraternity;<br />
					they blame not others<br />
					but simply themselves,<br />
					saying they are failures of little worth,<br />
					in that, though they started to be Pilgrims in the Doctrine and Rule so well preached,<br />
					they are incapable of life-long persistence<br />
					in the perfection and purity of the higher life;<br />
					and so these frequent the precincts<br />
					or become lay-disciples<br />
					under vow to observe the Five Precepts. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how the recluse Gotama<br />
					is esteemed and respected, <a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a> venerated and adored by his disciples,<br />
					and how they live with him<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How many qualities, Udāyi,<br />
					do you observe in me<br />
					to bring this about?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Five, sir; -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(i) The Lord eats but sparingly<br />
					and advocates a spare diet;<br />
					<a id="pt6" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg6"><span class="f2">[6]</span></a> (ii) the Lord is content to wear any raiment,<br />
					and commends the like contentment to others;<br />
					(iii) the Lord is content to accept any alms,<br />
					and commends the like contentment to others;<br />
					(iv) the Lord puts up with any lodging,<br />
					and commends the like contentment to others; and<br />
					(v) the Lord lives in seclusion himself<br />
					and advises others to be secluded. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the five qualities<br />
					which inspire the esteem of his disciples<br />
					for the recluse Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If their esteem, Udāyi,<br />
					turned on my being reputed to eat but sparingly<br />
					and to advocate a spare diet for others,<br />
					why, there are some of my disciples<br />
					who live on a pipkin of food a day,<br />
					others on half a pipkin,<br />
					others who take only the quantity of a vilva-fruit or just half that;<br />
					<a id="pt7" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg7"><span class="f2">[7]</span></a> whereas I myself sometimes eat a whole bowlful or more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So that, if it turned on my eating sparingly<br />
					and advocating a spare diet,<br />
					my abstemious disciples would not esteem me<br />
					or hold me in veneration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If again it turned on clothing,<br />
					I have some disciples<br />
					who go rudely clad in rags from the dustheaps,<br />
					who piece themselves together a cloak<br />
					from what tatters they can scavenge from charnel-grounds<br />
					or refuse-heaps<br />
					or mercers' sweepings;<br />
					whereas I myself sometimes wear lay-clothes,<br />
					so fine in web<br />
					that the down on the gourd<br />
					is coarse in comparison.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So that, if it turned on clothing,<br />
					my disciples whose clothes are got by scavenging<br />
					would not esteem or venerate me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If again it turned on taking what alms come along,<br />
					some of my disciples<br />
					punctiliously go to each house in its turn<br />
					and delight in the practice<br />
					of gleaning as they go<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and will not,<br />
					though they have gone indoors,<br />
					<a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> accept an invitation to take a seat;-<br />
					whereas I myself, on invitation,<br />
					sometimes fare on the choicest picked rice <a id="pt8" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg8"><span class="f2">[8]</span></a> with several sauces and curries.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So that, if it turned on alms from door to door,<br />
					these punctilious disciples of mine<br />
					would not esteem and venerate me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or, if it turned on lodging,<br />
					I have disciples who lodge under trees in the open<br />
					and are never under a roof for eight months at a stretch; -<br />
					whereas I myself am sometimes housed in storied mansions,<br />
					stuccoed all over,<br />
					which keep out the wind<br />
					with barred doors<br />
					and closed shutters.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So that, if it turned on lodging,<br />
					these open-air disciples of mine<br />
					would not esteem or venerate me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lastly, if it turned on seclusion,<br />
					1 have disciples who dwell in the wilds<br />
					and afar off in the distant depths of the forest,<br />
					with only a fortnightly meeting in Confraternity<br />
					to recite the Confession (<i>pāṭimokkha</i>); -<br />
					whereas I myself am at times beset by Almsmen,<br />
					Almswomen,<br />
					lay disciples of both sexes,<br />
					princes and lords,<br />
					sectaries and the disciples of sectaries.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So that, if it turned on seclusion,<br />
					<a id="pt9" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg9"><span class="f2">[9]</span></a> these anchorite disciples of mine<br />
					would not esteem or venerate me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Udāyi;<br />
					these five qualities<br />
					would not make me esteemed and respected,<br />
					venerated and adored by my disciples,<br />
					nor would these five qualities<br />
					make them live with me<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But there are five other qualities<br />
					which do achieve this<br />
					and they are the following: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(1) First, my disciples value the higher virtue<br />
					and believe that I am virtuous<br />
					and endowed with virtue in its perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first conviction<br />
					which makes me esteemed and respected,<br />
					venerated and adored by my disciples,<br />
					who live with me<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p><b>Ken.</b> (Chalmers translation of <i>(ñāṇa)</i>) 1. range of sight or vision; power or exercise of vision, look, gaze; mental perception or recognition; v. causative: to make known, declare, to impart the knowledge of a thing; to direct, teach or instruct; non-causative: to descry, see, catch sight of; discover by sight; to see, recognize, identify, distinguish, know. —O.E.D.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">(2) Secondly, my disciples value outstanding ken and vision,<br />
					and believe that I say I know and see<br />
					just because I do know and see;<br />
					they believe that I preach my Doctrine<br />
					- not without, but with - transcendent knowledge,<br />
					with origins,<br />
					and with assignable <a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> conditions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt10" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg10"><span class="f2">[10]</span></a> This is the second conviction<br />
					which makes me esteemed and respected,<br />
					venerated and adored by my disciples,<br />
					who live with me<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(3) My disciples value supereminent intellect<br />
					and believe that I have intellect<br />
					and am endowed with all intellect<br />
					in its perfection,<br />
					and that it is unthinkable<br />
					I should either not see in advance<br />
					the future trend of an argument<br />
					or fail to refute the unsound arguments of opponents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Knowing and seeing this,<br />
					would my disciples interrupt discussion?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nor, Udāyi, do I seek instruction from my disciples;<br />
					it is they who seek instruction from me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All this breeds the third conviction<br />
					which makes me esteemed and respected,<br />
					venerated and adored by my disciples,<br />
					who live with me<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(4) Fourthly, when my disciples are beset by I11<br />
					and spent with I11 in any particular shape,<br />
					they come to question me<br />
					on the Noble Truth of I11; -<br />
					I tell them<br />
					and win their hearts by my answers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The same takes place<br />
					with the Noble Truths concerning the origin of I11,<br />
					the cessation of I11,<br />
					and the way leading to that cessation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This breeds the fourth conviction<br />
					<a id="pt11" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg11"><span class="f2">[11]</span></a> which makes me esteemed and respected,<br />
					venerated and adored by my disciples,<br />
					who live with me<br />
					on terms of esteem and respect</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(5) Fifthly, I have shown my disciples the way<br />
					whereby they develop the four starting-points<br />
					for mustering up mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Herein, an Almsman dwells -<br />
					as regards the body -<br />
					in the realization of what the body is,<br />
					in ardour, in self-awareness and in mindfulness,<br />
					quit of all worldly distress of mind and body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He does the same with feelings,<br />
					and with his heart,<br />
					and with states of consciousness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the four Right Struggles. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They resolve,<br />
					they strive,<br />
					they persevere,<br />
					they exert and strain their heart<br />
					for the fourfold purposes of<br />
					<i>(a)</i> checking the rise of evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					<i>(b)</i> shedding evil and wrong states<br />
					which have already arisen,<br />
					<a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> <i>(c)</i> encouraging the rise of right states<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					and <i>(d)</i> ensuring that right states<br />
					which are there already<br />
					shall be stablished and ordered aright,<br />
					multiplied,<br />
					and developed,<br />
					shall wax apace<br />
					and grow to perfection. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Four Bases of Psychic Power, -<br />
					resolve,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					heart,<br />
					and investigation,<br />
					each informed by the plastic forces<br />
					of concentration and struggle. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Five Faculties, -<br />
					<a id="pt12" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg12"><span class="f2">[12]</span></a> faith,<br />
					exertion,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					intellect,<br />
					each leading on to tranquillity<br />
					and to full enlightenment. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Five Strengths, -<br />
					the strengths of faith,<br />
					of exertion,<br />
					of mindfulness,<br />
					of concentration,<br />
					and of intellect,<br />
					each leading on to tranquillity<br />
					and to full enlightenment. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Seven Factors of Enlightenment, -<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					research into the Doctrine,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					zest,<br />
					serenity,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					and the poise of indifference,<br />
					each based on seclusion,<br />
					passionlessness and cessation,<br />
					and merging into Renunciation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Noble Eightfold Path, -<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right intention,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness and<br />
					right concentration. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Eight Deliverances.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Conscious of his own bodily form,<br />
					a man sees external forms; -<br />
					this is the first Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Inwardly un- <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> conscious of his own bodily form,<br />
					he sees external forms<br />
					this is the second Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Appreciation of its goodliness<br />
					is the third Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By passage wholly beyond <a id="pt13" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg13"><span class="f2">[13]</span></a> all perception of form,<br />
					by extinction of perceptions of sensory reactions,<br />
					by the ignoring of perceptions of multiplicity,<br />
					the thought of space as infinite<br />
					leads him to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the sphere of Infinite Space; -<br />
					and this is the fourth Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By passage wholly beyond the sphere of infinite space,<br />
					the thought of consciousness as infinite<br />
					leads him to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the sphere of Infinite Consciousness; -<br />
					and this is the fifth Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By passage wholly beyond the sphere of infinite consciousness,<br />
					tne thought of nothingness leads him to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the sphere of Naught; -<br />
					and this is the sixth Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By passage wholly beyond the sphere of Naught,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception; -<br />
					and this is the seventh Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lastly, by passage wholly beyond the sphere of neither perception nor nonperception,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the cessation of the feeling of perceptions,<br />
					which is the eighth Deliverance, -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the eight Spheres of Mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Inwardly conscious of possessing bodily form,<br />
					one individual sees outside himself forms,<br />
					fair or foul,<br />
					which are small;<br />
					these he masters<br />
					so that he perceives he knows and sees them. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first Sphere of Mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The second is when a man can say the like<br />
					about external forms which are infinite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The third is when,<br />
					being himself unconscious of his own bodily form,<br />
					a man can say the like<br />
					about small external objects;<br />
					and the fourth is when<br />
					these external objects are infinite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lost to all bodily form of his own,<br />
					an individual sees external objects which are blue,<br />
					blue in colour,<br />
					blue to behold,<br />
					blue of sheen. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as the flax-flower is blue,<br />
					blue in colour,<br />
					blue to behold,<br />
					blue of sheen;<br />
					or just as Benares muslin,<br />
					with a finish on both front and back,<br />
					is blue ... in sheen<br />
					so blue <a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> are the external objects he sees;<br />
					these he masters<br />
					so that he perceives that he knows and sees them. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fifth <a id="pt14" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg14"><span class="f2">[14]</span></a> Sphere of Mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The sixth is when,<br />
					lost to consciousness of any bodily form of his own,<br />
					an individual sees external objects which are yellow,<br />
					yellow in colour,<br />
					yellow to behold,<br />
					yellow of sheen,<br />
					yellow as the Kaṇṇikāra flower<br />
					or the muslin of Benares is yellow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The seventh is when he sees red things,<br />
					red as the bandhu-jīvaka blossom<br />
					or Benares muslin are red.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lastly,<br />
					being inwardly unconscious of possessing bodily form,<br />
					an individual sees things which are white,<br />
					white in colour,<br />
					white to behold,<br />
					white in sheen, -<br />
					white as the morning star<br />
					or Benares muslin is white;<br />
					these he masters<br />
					so that he perceives he knows and sees them. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Ten Hypnotics.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One individual perceives a plot of earth<br />
					from above,<br />
					from below,<br />
					across,<br />
					in unity,<br />
					and infinite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Others do the same with water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red,<br />
					and white,<br />
					space and<br />
					<a id="pt15" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><span class="f2">[15]</span></a> consciousness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop<br />
					the Four Ecstasies.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Herein, an Almsman,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and of wrong states of mind<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction bred of aloofness,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an expert bath-attendant<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					will sprinkle soap-powder on a metal slab<br />
					and knead it up<br />
					with the water which he keeps on sprinkling over it,<br />
					until the whole of the soap-powder is one mass of lather,<br />
					permeated by the lather<br />
					both in and out,<br />
					with not a trickle of moisture left; -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction bred of aloofness,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, rising above observation and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with the zest and satisfaction<br />
					bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a lake<br />
					fed from below by a spring,<br />
					with no other influx of water from east<br />
					or west<br />
					or north<br />
					or south,<br />
					a lake on which the heavens should send no showers from time to time;<br />
					yet from the spring below<br />
					there would well up cool waters into the lake,<br />
					so sluicing<br />
					and drenching<br />
					and permeating<br />
					and suffusing that lake<br />
					that there is no part of that lake<br />
					which is not suffused thereby; -<br />
					in just the same way does this Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body with the zest and satisfaction<br />
					bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which js not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					that satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness<br />
					bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					with satisfaction,<br />
					without zest,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					by this satisfaction without zest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in a pond of lotuses,<br />
					blue<br />
					or red<br />
					or white,<br />
					some lotuses of each kind<br />
					are born and grow in the water,<br />
					never rising above the surface<br />
					but flourishing beneath it;<br />
					and these from root to tip<br />
					are so sluiced<br />
					and drenched<br />
					and permeated<br />
					and suffused<br />
					by the cool waters<br />
					that there is not a lotus,<br />
					blue<br />
					or red<br />
					or white,<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					from root to tip<br />
					by the cool waters: -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so sluice<br />
					and drench<br />
					and permeate<br />
					and suffuse<br />
					his very body<br />
					with satisfaction without zest,<br />
					that there is no part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, by putting from him<br />
					both satisfaction and dissatisfaction<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His very body does he so suffuse<br />
					with a heart made pure and clean<br />
					that, as he sits,<br />
					there is no single part of his body<br />
					which is not suffused<br />
					by his pure and clean heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man were sitting<br />
					wrapped head and all<br />
					in a garment of white,<br />
					with not a single part of his body<br />
					not wrapped in it, -<br />
					in just the same way<br />
					does the Almsman so suffuse his very body<br />
					with a heart made pure and clean<br />
					that, as he sits,<br />
					there is no single part of his body<br />
					<a id="pt16" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg16"><span class="f2">[16-17]</span></a> not wrapped in pure and clean thoughts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they comprehend that -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This corporeal frame of mine<br />
					is made up of the four Elements,<br />
					starts from parents,<br />
					is sustained by rice and other foods,<br />
					is impermanent and subject to attrition,<br />
					abrasion,<br />
					erasion,<br />
					dissolution and<br />
					disruption;<br />
					and this consciousness of mine<br />
					is tied and bound up therewith.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a beautiful sparkling gem<br />
					of the purest water<br />
					and of eight facets,<br />
					excellently cut,<br />
					clear,<br />
					translucent,<br />
					flawless<br />
					and excellent in every way, -<br />
					through which there passes a blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red,<br />
					white,<br />
					or yellowish thread.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></a> Even as a man with eyes wherewith to see<br />
					has only to take it in his hand<br />
					to mark that it is such a gem<br />
					and is on such a thread, -<br />
					so have I shown my disciples the way<br />
					whereby to have this comprehension of body<br />
					and of consciousness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they call into being<br />
					out of this body<br />
					another body<br />
					of the mind's creation,<br />
					complete in all its limbs and members,<br />
					and with transcendental faculties.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					who should draw a reed from its sheath -<br />
					or a snake from its slough -<br />
					or a sword from its scabbard, -<br />
					recognizing that the reed,<br />
					the snake,<br />
					or the sword<br />
					was one thing<br />
					and the sheath,<br />
					slough,<br />
					or scabbard<br />
					was another;<br />
					the one being drawn out of the other.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt18" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg18"><span class="f2">[18]</span></a> Just in the same way<br />
					have I shown my disciples<br />

					... faculties.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop divers psychic powers, -<br />
					from being one to become manifold,<br />
					from being manifold to become one;<br />
					to become visible or invisible;<br />
					to pass at will through wall or fence or hill as if through air;<br />
					to pass in and out of the solid earth as if it were water;<br />
					to walk on the water's unbroken surface as if it were the solid earth;<br />
					to elide,<br />
					as they sit serene,<br />
					through the air like a winged bird;<br />
					to touch and to handle the sun and moon in their power and might;<br />
					and to extend the sovereignty of their bodies<br />
					right up to the heavens of Brahma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a skilful potter<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					can make and fashion any shape he will<br />
					out of prepared clay,<br />
					or an ivory-worker out of ivory,<br />
					or a goldsmith out of gold; -<br />
					even so have I shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they develop divers psychic powers<br />
					... <a id="pt19" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg19"><span class="f2">[19]</span></a> heavens of Brahma. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby,<br />
					with the Celestial Ear,<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					they hear twofold sounds,<br />
					both the celestial and the human,<br />
					whether far or near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a mighty conch-blower<br />
					can with ease<br />
					make his <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> blast heard<br />
					in all the four directions,-<br />
					so have I shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby<br />
					... far and near. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />
					of intellect's consummate perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby their hearts read the hearts of others, -<br />
					knowing the heart where passion dwells as passionate,<br />
					and the passionless heart as passionless,<br />
					the unkind heart as unkind,<br />
					and the kind heart as kind,<br />
					the deluded heart as deluded,<br />
					and the undeluded heart as undeluded,<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as a woman or man<br />

					on surveying the reflection of their features<br />
					in a bright, clean mirror<br />
					or in a bowl of clean water,<br />
					and on seeing reflected there<br />
					a smut or a pimple -<br />

					either that there was a smut or a pimple there<br />
					<a id="pt20" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg20"><span class="f2">[20]</span></a> or that there was none at all; -<br />

					I have shown my disciples the way<br />
					whereby their hearts read the hearts of others, -<br />
					knowing the heart where passion dwells as passionate,<br />
					and the passionless heart as passionless,<br />
					the unkind heart as unkind,<br />

					<p class="f4">In this way, too,<br />
					many of my disciples<br />
					have come to dwell in the attainment<br />

					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby they recall their divers existences in the past<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />

					<p class="f4">Moreover, I have shown my disciples<br />
					the way whereby,<br />
					with the Eye Celestial,<br />

					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					they see them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />

					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus do they with the Eye Celestial<br />

					happy and unhappy,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were two houses with doors to them,<br />
					and as if,<br />
					from midway between them,<br />
