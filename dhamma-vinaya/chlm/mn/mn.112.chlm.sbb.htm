					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose an Almsman makes profession<br />
					of having risen to fullest Knowledge<br />
					in the words: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is now no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what I have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His words ought to be received<br />
					alike without rejoicing<br />
					and without scorn;<br />
					and, alike without rejoicing<br />
					and without scorn,<br />
					the following question should be asked of him; -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the arahat all enlightened,<br />
					has defined four categories of discoveries, -<br />
					namely,<br />
					the man who has discovered by vision<br />
					in the domain of vision,<br />
					the man who has discovered by hearing<br />
					in the domain of hearing,<br />
					the man who has discovered by sensing<br />
					in the domain of taste smell and touch,<br />
					and the man who has discovered by apprehending <a id="pt80" href="../../pali/mn/mn.112.pali.bd.htm#pg80"><span class="f2">[80]</span></a> in the domain of apprehending.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By what manner of ken and vision<br />
					under these four heads<br />
					has your reverence's heart<br />
					been absolutely Delivered from the Cankers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Almsman in whom the Cankers are dead and gone,<br />
					who' has greatly lived,<br />
					who has cast off his burthens,<br />
					who has won his weal,<br />
					whose bonds are no more,<br />
					who by utter Knowledge<br />
					has gained final Deliverance,-he,<br />
					consonantly with the Doctrine,<br />
					makes answer: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the domain of seeing,<br />
					and in each of the three other domains also,<br />
					I dwell,<br />
					without leanings<br />
					and without aversion,<br />
					without dependence<br />
					and without being enamoured,<br />
					but with heart untrammelled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This <a id="pg174"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></a> is the manner of ken and vision<br />
					whereby under these four heads<br />
					my heart has been absolutely Delivered from the Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, you will say to him, rejoicing<br />
					and thankful for what the Almsman has said;<br />
					and you will proceed to ask the following question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has revealed five factors of attachment,<br />
					namely<br />
					form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the constituents<br />
					and consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By what manner of ken and vision<br />
					under these five heads<br />
					has your reverence's heart<br />
					been absolutely Delivered from the Cankers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The true arahat as aforesaid<br />
					makes answer consonantly with the Doctrine as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having come to see that form<br />
					is a weak, evanescent and comfortless thing,<br />
					I know that my heart is delivered<br />
					from the heart's attraction<br />
					and attachment to forms,<br />
					<a id="pt81" href="../../pali/mn/mn.112.pali.bd.htm#pg81"><span class="f2">[81]</span></a> which implant obstinacy,<br />
					prejudice<br />
					and bias, -<br />
					is Delivered therefrom<br />
					by destroying them,<br />
					by losing all passion for them,<br />
					by laying them to rest,<br />
					by renouncing them<br />
					and by forsaking them altogether.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the like Deliverance is mine<br />
					from the other four factors<br />
					of feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the constituents<br />
					and consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the manner of ken and vision<br />
					whereby, in respect of these five factors of attachment,<br />
					I know my heart to be absolutely Delivered from Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, you will say to him, rejoicing<br />
					and thankful for what the Almsman has said;<br />
					and you will proceed to ask the following question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has revealed six elements,<br />
					namely<br />
					earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					space<br />
					and mentality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By what manner of ken and vision,<br />
					in respect of these six elements,<br />
					has your reverence's heart<br />
					been absolutely Delivered from the Cankers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The true arahat makes answer<br />
					consonantly with the Doctrine<br />
					as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I approach the earth-element -<br />
					and in turn each of the five other elements -<br />
					as being non-Self,<br />
					with no basing of Self on the element,<br />
					so that I know that my heart<br />
					is Delivered from the heart's attractions<br />
					and attachments based on <a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> an element,<br />
					which implant obstinacy,<br />
					prejudice and bias, -<br />

					by losing all passion for them,<br />
					by laying them to rest,<br />
					by renouncing them<br />
					and by forsaking them altogether.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the manner of ken and vision<br />
					whereby, in respect of these six elements,<br />
					I know my heart to be absolutely Delivered from the Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, you will say to him, <a id="pt82" href="../../pali/mn/mn.112.pali.bd.htm#pg82"><span class="f2">[82]</span></a> rejoicing<br />
					and thankful for what the Almsman has said;<br />
					and you will proceed to ask the following question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has revealed six internal sense-organs<br />
					and six external sense-objects,<br />
					namely eye and forms,<br />
					ear and sounds,<br />
					nose and odours,<br />
					tongue and tastes,<br />
					body and tangible objects,<br />
					mind and mental objects.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By what manner of ken and vision,<br />
					in respect of these six pairs,<br />
					has your reverence's heart<br />
					been absolutely Delivered from the Cankers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The true arahat makes answer<br />
					consonantly with the Doctrine as follows:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In respect of the eye and form,<br />
					of visual cognition and objects visually cognizable,<br />
					I know that my heart is Delivered from desire,<br />
					passion,<br />
					delight,<br />
					craving,<br />
					and from the heart's attractions<br />
					and attachments based on eye and form,<br />
					which implant obstinacy,<br />
					prejudice and bias, -<br />
					is Delivered therefrom by destroying them,<br />
					by losing all passion for them,<br />
					by laying them to rest,<br />
					by renouncing them<br />
					and by forsaking them altogether.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the like holds good<br />
					of the five other pairs of sense-organs and sense-objects.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the manner of ken and vision<br />
					whereby, in respect of these six pairs,<br />
					I know my heart to be absolutely delivered from the Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Excellent, you will say to him, rejoicing<br />
					and thankful for what the Almsman has said;<br />
					and you will proceed to ask this further question: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By what manner of ken and vision<br />
					has the bias of pride in 'I' and 'mine'<br />
					been extirpated<br />
					in respect both of this mind-informed body<br />
					and of all external phenomena?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt33" href="../../pali/mn/mn.112.pali.bd.htm#pg33"><span class="f2">[33]</span></a> The true arahat makes answer<br />
					consonantly with the Doctrine as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> Aforetime, Almsmen,<br />
					when I had a house and home,<br />
					I dwelt in ignorance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To me the Doctrine was expounded by the Truth-finder<br />
					or by a disciple of the Truth-finder;<br />
					and, by hearing it,<br />
					I came to faith in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and this awakened faith in him<br />
					led me to bethink myself that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas the Pilgrim is free as the air of heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is hard for the home-keeping man<br />
					to follow the higher life<br />
					in all its completeness<br />
					and purity<br />
					and perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, let me cut off hair and beard<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereafter, parting from my substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from my kith and kin,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					I cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes<br />
					and went forth from home to homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					schooled as an Almsman in thought and conduct,<br />
					I put from me all killing,<br />
					I put from me all killing<br />
					and abstained from killing anything</p>

					<p class="f4">Laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					I lived a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft I put from me and eschewed;<br />
					taking only what was given to me by others,<br />
					and waiting till it is given,<br />
					I lived an honest and clean life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from me<br />
					all that does not belong to the higher life,<br />
					I lead the higher life in virtue,<br />
					abstaining from low sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from me<br />
					and abstaining from all lying,<br />
					I spoke the truth,<br />
					cleaved to the truth,<br />
					and was staunch and leal,<br />
					never deceiving the world with my lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calumny I put from me and eschewed,<br />
					not repeating elsewhere<br />
					to the harm of people here<br />
					what I heard there,<br />
					nor repeating here<br />
					to the harm of people elsewhere<br />
					what I heard elsewhere;<br />
					thus I healed divisions<br />
					and cemented friendship,<br />
					seeking peace<br />
					and ensuing it;<br />
					for in peace was my delight<br />
					and my words were ever the words of a peacemaker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling I put from me,<br />
					and abstained from reviling people;<br />
					my words were without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					going home to the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tattle I put from me<br />
					and abstained therefrom,<br />
					I spoke, in season<br />
					and according to the facts,<br />
					words of help<br />
					concerning the Doctrine<br />
					and the Rule,<br />
					words to be stored in the heart,<br />
					words duly illustrated,<br />
					fraught with purpose,<br />
					and pithy.</p>

					<p class="f4">I sedulously avoided hurting the seeds<br />
					or plants of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">I took but one meal a day,<br />
					never eating at night<br />
					or after hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">I refrained from looking on at shows of dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">I eschewed all use and employment<br />
					of smart garlands,<br />
					scents<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">I slept on no tall or broad beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">I refuseed to accept gold<br />
					or coins of silver, -<br />
					uncooked grain or meat, -<br />
					women or girls, -<br />
					bondwomen or bondmen, -<br />
					sheep or goats, -<br />
					fowls or swine, -<br />
					elephants or cattle or horses or mares, -<br />
					fields or land.</p>

					<p class="f4">I refrained from the practice<br />
					of sending or going on messages.</p>

					<p class="f4">I neither bought nor sold.</p>

					<p class="f4">I never cheated with weights,<br />
					coins,<br />
					or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">I took no part in bribery,<br />
					cozening,<br />
					cheating,<br />
					or other crooked ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">I never joined in wounding,<br />
					murdering,<br />
					and manacling,<br />
					or in highway robbery,<br />
					brigandage,<br />
					and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contented was I<br />
					with whatever robes were given me<br />
					as clothing,<br />
					and with whatever alms were given<br />
					for my belly's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wheresoever I went,<br />
					I took all my belongings with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a winged bird,<br />
					wheresoever it goes,<br />
					carries with it its feathers and all, -<br />
					so, wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					I enjoyed unsullied well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with my eye<br />
					I saw a visible shape,<br />
					I was not absorbed by either its general appearance<br />
					or its details;<br />
					but, since the eye uncontrolled<br />
					might lead to covetousness and discontent,<br />
					to evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					I schooled myself to control it,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to establish control.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I did the like<br />
					with my five other faculties of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble control over my faculties,<br />
					I enjoyed unalloyed well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purposeful was I in all my doings, -<br />
					whether in coming in or going out,<br />
					in looking ahead or around,<br />
					in stretching out my arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing my clothes<br />
					or carrying my bowl,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring food,<br />
					in attending to the calls of nature,<br />
					in walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speech or in silence; -<br />
					I was always purposeful in all I did.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					a master of this noble code of control of my faculties of sense,<br />
					and a master of noble mindfulness and purpose in all I did,<br />
					I resorted to a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">After my meal,<br />
					when I was back from my round for alms,<br />
					I sat myself cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					with my heart set on mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">My life was purged<br />
					(i.) of appetite for things of the world,<br />
					for I had put from me<br />
					all appetite therefor; -<br />
					(ii.) of all spiteful thoughts,<br />
					for I was filled only with loving-kindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives; -<br />
					(iii.) of all torpor,<br />
					for all torpor had left me,<br />
					driven out by clarity of vision,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by purpose in all I did; -<br />
					(iv.) of ail flurry and worry,<br />
					for I was serene,<br />
					and my heart within was at peace<br />
					and quit of all worries; - and<br />
					(v.) of all doubts,<br />
					for my life was unclouded by doubt,<br />
					I was troubled by no questionings,<br />
					right states of mind<br />
					had purged my heart of all doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I had put from me these Five Hindrances,<br />
					those defilements of the heart<br />
					which weaken a man's insight,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>					

					<p class="f4">As I rose above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in my frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting from me both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows I used to feel,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					it was thus that I applied my heart to the knowledge which recalled my earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">I called to mind my divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />
					I remembered,<br />
					such and such was my name,<br />
					my sept,<br />
					my class,<br />
					my diet,<br />
					my joys and sorrows,<br />
					and my term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed thence,<br />
					I came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was my name and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I passed to my life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus did I call to mind my divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, brahmin, was the first knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the first watch of that night,-<br />
					ignorance dispelled and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					I now applied to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					I saw beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					I saw them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this did I see with the Eye Celestial;<br />
					and this, brahmin, was the second knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the second watch of that night, -<br />
					ignorance dispelled and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					I next applied to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I comprehended,<br />
					aright and to the full, Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">I comprehended,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					what the Cankers were,<br />
					with their origin,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt86" href="../../pali/mn/mn.112.pali.bd.htm#pg86"><span class="f2">[86]</span></a> When I knew this<br />
					and when I saw this,<br />
					then my heart was delivered<br />
					from the Canker of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to me thus delivered<br />
					came the knowledge of my Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction -<br />
					Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me<br />
					there is no more of what I have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the manner of ken and vision<br />
					whereby the bias of 'I' and 'mine'<br />
					has been extirpated in respect<br />
					both of this mind-informed body<br />
