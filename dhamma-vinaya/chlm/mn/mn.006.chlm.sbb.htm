					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let your lives conform to the codes of Virtue and of Obligations;<br />
					let your lives be restrained by the restraint of the Obligations<br />
					and ordered on the plane of right behaviour;<br />
					be scrupulous in observing the precepts of conduct,<br />
					seeing peril in small offendings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should an Almsman yearn to be dear to his fellows in the higher life<br />
					and beloved by them,<br />
					revered and famed among them, -<br />
					let him fulfil the whole code of virtue,<br />
					calm his heart within him,<br />
					cultivating the Ecstasies,<br />
					fostering Insight,<br />
					and perfecting himself in inward detachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him do this too,<br />
					if his yearning is either<br />
					that he may be given robes,<br />
					food,<br />
					lodging<br />
					and medicaments; -<br />
					or that the donors of such gifts to <a id="pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> him<br />
					may reap a rich reward<br />
					and blessing therefrom; -<br />
					or that such of his own kith and kin<br />
					departed in the faith<br />
					who keep him in mind,<br />
					may reap a rich reward<br />
					and blessing therefrom; -<br />
					or that he may overcome,<br />
					and not be overcome by,<br />
					discontent and sensuality,<br />
					and fear and dread; -<br />
					or that, without toil and travail,<br />
					he may have fruition of the Four Ecstasies<br />
					with their illumination<br />
					and the satisfaction they bring here and now; -<br />
					or that he may enter on<br />
					and abide in<br />
					physical experience of those excellent Deliverances<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					which transcend visible form<br />
					and are formless;<br />
					-or that, by destroying the (first) three Bonds,<br />
					he may enter on conversion's first stage,<br />
					secure thenceforth<br />
					against rebirth in any state of woe<br />
					and assured of ultimate Enlightenment; -<br />
					or that, by destroying the three Bonds<br />
					and reducing to small dimensions<br />
					passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion,<br />
					he may enter on conversion's second stage<br />
					and have to return but once more to this world<br />
					in order to make an end of Ill; -<br />
					or that, by destroying all five Bonds<br />
					which bind him to this lower world,<br />
					he may be translated elsewhere<br />
					(to the higher Brahma world),<br />
					there to pass utterly away<br />
					without any return thence; -<br />
					or that it may be his to enjoy in turn<br />
					each and every form of psychic power, -<br />
					from being one to become manifold,<br />
					from being manifold to become one,<br />
					to be visible or invisible,<br />
					to pass at will through wall<br />
					or fence<br />
					or hill<br />
					as if through air;<br />
					to pass in and out of the solid earth<br />
					as if it were water,<br />
					to walk on the water's unbroken surface<br />
					as if it were the solid earth,<br />
					to glide in state through the air<br />
					like a bird on the wing,<br />
					to touch and to handle the moon and sun<br />
					in their power and might,<br />
					and to extend the sovereignty of his body<br />
					right up to the Brahma world; -<br />
					or that, with the Ear Celestial<br />
					which is pure and far surpasses the ear of men,<br />
					he may hear both heavenly and human sounds,<br />
					sounds near and sounds afar; -<br />
					or that he may comprehend with his own heart<br />
					the hearts of other creatures<br />
					and of other men<br />
					so as to know them for just <a id="pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> what they are, -<br />
					filled with passion or free from passion,<br />
					hating or free from hate,<br />
					filled with delusion or free therefrom,<br />
					focussed or wandering,<br />
					large-minded or small-minded,<br />
					inferior or superior,<br />
					stedfast or unstedfast,<br />
					Delivered or lacking Deliverance; -<br />
					or that he may recall to mind<br />
					his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to'] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an seon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an seon both of its disintegration and of its redintegration, -<br />
					remembering, in every detail and feature,<br />
					that in this or that former existence<br />
					such and such was his name,<br />
					his sept,<br />
					his class,<br />
					his diet,<br />
					his joys and sorrows,<br />
					and his term of life,<br />
					ere, passing thence,<br />
					he came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was his name and so forth,<br />
					right up to the time when he passed to his present life here; -<br />
					or that with the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he may see creatures in the act of passing hence<br />
					and re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					creatures high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe,<br />
					all faring according to their past<br />
					(etc, as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>); -<br />
					or that, by eradicating the Cankers,<br />
					he may-here and now,<br />
					of and by himself -<br />
					comprehend,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which knows no Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was to this intent<br />
					that I have said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let your lives conform<br />
					to the codes of Virtue<br />
					and of Obligations;<br />
					let your lives be restrained<br />
					by the restraint of the Obligations<br />
					and ordered on the plane of right behaviour;<br />
					be scrupulous in observing the precepts of conduct,<br />
					seeing peril in small offendings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
