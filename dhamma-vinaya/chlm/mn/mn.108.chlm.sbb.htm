					<p class="f4">Once when, soon after the passing of the Lord,<br />
					the reverendĀnanda was staying at Rājagaha,<br />
					in the Bamboo-grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					Ajātasattu, King of Magadha,<br />
					son of the Videha princess,<br />
					was putting Rājagaha's defences in repair,<br />
					out of suspicions of King Pajjota.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Early in the morning, Ānanda,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into Rājagaha for alms,<br />
					but, bethinking him that the hour was too early yet,<br />
					decided to go to the works<br />
					which the brahmin Gopaka-Moggallāna had in charge;<br />
					and thither he betook himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing him coming some way off,<br />
					the brahmin invited him to approach as a welcome visitor<br />
					after so long an absence<br />
					and put out for him a seat<br />
					on whichĀnanda seated himself,<br />
					<a id="pt8" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg8"><span class="f2">[8]</span></a> while the brahmin sat down on a lower seat and said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there a single Almsman<br />
					who in every respect<br />
					and in every particular<br />
					possesses all the qualities<br />
					that were possessed by the reverend Gotama,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For the Lord made a Path<br />
					where path there was none,<br />
					traced out a Path<br />
					where path there was none,<br />
					and revealed a Path<br />
					till then unrevealed;<br />
					he knew and saw the Path;<br />
					master of the Path was he.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To-day his disciples follow him<br />
					in the Path which has come to them from him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their talk was cut short<br />
					by the arrival of the brahmin Vassakāra,<br />
					a minister of the Magadha court,<br />
					who came,<br />
					in the course of an inspection of the works at Rājagaha,<br />
					to the works which Gopaka-Moggallāna had in charge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seating himself<br />
					after courteous greetings to Ānanda,<br />
					Vassakāra asked<br />
					what had been the topic of their interrupted conversation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And <a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> Ānanda repeated Gopaka-Moggallāna's question<br />
					and <a id="pt9" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg9"><span class="f2">[9]</span></a> his own answer,<br />
					which had been followed by Vassakāra's arrival.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there any particular Almsman, Ānanda,<br />
					who was designated by the reverend Gotama<br />
					to be at his decease your alternative refuge,<br />
					and to whom,<br />
					in his place,<br />
					you might have recourse to-day?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there any such Almsman<br />
					chosen for this purpose by the Confraternity<br />
					and designated as such by Elders and Almsmen?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having no such alternative refuge,<br />
					how come you to be in such unison?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We lack not an alternative refuge, brahmin;<br />
					we have one in the Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I note your several answers<br />
					to my several questions <a id="pt10" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg10"><span class="f2">[10]</span></a><br />
					and can only ask what your words mean.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord who knew and saw,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					prescribed a rule of life<br />
					and laid down a canon law.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Every sabbath all of us who live in the precincts of a village -<br />
					meet as a body<br />
					and in meeting<br />
					enquire what each is doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, when this is being told us,<br />
					an offence or a transgression by an Almsman is disclosed,<br />
					we make him act according to the Doctrine<br />
					and according to book.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is not by us, we hold,<br />
					but by the Doctrine<br />
					that he is constrained.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there any one particular Almsman<br />
					whom to-day you respect and revere,<br />
					to whom you show honour and worship<br />
					and to whom you look up with respect and reverence?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In answer to my previous questions,<br />
					you have already told me<br />
					that Gotama designated no Almsman<br />
					as an alternative to himself<br />
					as your refuge at his death,<br />
					and that <a id="pt11" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg11"><span class="f2">[11]</span></a> the Confraternity<br />
					has designated no one since;<br />
					but now you tell me<br />
					there is an Almsman whom you revere<br />
					and in dependence on whom<br />
					you live in respect and reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What can your words mean?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord indicated ten blissful qualities,<br />
					the <a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> presence of which impels us to respect and revere a man,<br />
					to honour and worship him,<br />
					and to look up to him<br />
					with respect and reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are these ten qualities? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who is virtuous,<br />
					who lives conformably to the canon law,<br />
					who behaves aright,<br />
					who is fearful of little faults<br />
					and undertakes a training<br />
					according to the precepts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He learns much,<br />
					remembers much,<br />
					stores and treasures much.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All doctrines that are fair at the outset,<br />
					fair in the middle and fair in their close,<br />
					which set forth with text and meaning the higher life<br />
					in all its perfection and purity,<br />
					- all these are heard,<br />
					learned by heart,<br />
					garnered by recital,<br />
					turned over and over in his mind<br />
					and penetrated by vision.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is content with his raiment and other requisites.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At will and readily<br />
					he joys in the Four Ecstasies<br />
					in all their pellucidity<br />
					and with all their comfort here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops in turn each several psychic power; -<br />
					from being one he becomes manifold,<br />
					from being manifold he becomes one,<br />
					is visible or invisible,<br />
					passes at will through wall or fence or hill<br />
					as if in air,<br />
					passes in and out of the solid earth<br />
					as if it were water,<br />
					walks on the water's unbroken surface<br />
					as if it were the solid earth,<br />
					<a id="pt12" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg12"><span class="f2">[12]</span></a> sitting in state<br />
					glides through the air<br />
					like a bird on the wing,<br />
					touches and handles the sun and moon in their power and might,<br />
					and extends the sovereignty of his body<br />
					right up to the Brahmā world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the ear Celestial<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					he hears sounds celestial and sounds human,<br />
					both far and near.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His heart knows the heart<br />
					of other creatures<br />
					and other men,<br />
					knows them for what they are, -<br />
					the heart where passion dwells as passionate,<br />
					the passionless heart as passionless,<br />
					the unkind heart as unkind,<br />
					the kindly heart as kindly,<br />
					the deluded heart as deluded,<br />
					the undeluded heart as undeluded,<br />
					the concentrated heart as concentrated,<br />
					the unconcentrated heart as unconcentrated,<br />
					the great heart as great<br />
					and the little heart as little,<br />
					the inferior heart as inferior<br />
					and the superior heart as superior,<br />
					the stedfast heart as stedfast<br />
					and the unstedfast heart as unstedfast, <a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> the heart Delivered as Delivered,<br />
					and the heart undelivered as undelivered.</p>

					<p class="f4">He recalls his own divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />
					he remembers,<br />
					'Such and such was my name,<br />
					my sept,<br />
					my class,<br />
					my diet,<br />
					my joys and sorrows,<br />
					and my term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed thence,<br />
					I came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was my name and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I passed to my life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he call to mind his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					he sees them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees creatures in act to pass hence<br />
					and to appear elsewhere,<br />
					creatures lowly or debonair,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					all passing to fare according to their deserts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By the eradication of the Cankers,<br />
					he - here and now,<br />
					and of himself -<br />
					knows,<br />
					realizes,<br />
					develops<br />
					and dwells<br />
					in that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					in which the Cankers are no more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These, brahmin, are the ten blissful qualities<br />
					indicated by the Lord,<br />
					the presence of which<br />
					impels us to respect and revere a man,<br />
					to honour and worship him,<br />
					and to look up to him with respect and reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt18" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg18"><span class="f2">[18]</span></a> At this point the brahmin Vassakāra,<br />
					minister of the Magadha court,<br />
					said to Upānanda,<br />
					the Commander in Chief: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it be thus<br />
					that these reverend men<br />
					respect the man worthy of respect,<br />
					revere the man worthy of reverence,<br />
					honour the man worthy of honour<br />
					and worship the man worthy of worship, -<br />
					surely they are right herein.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If they did not give to such a man<br />
					their respect and reverence,<br />
					their honour and worship, -<br />
					to what could they possibly give it?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Turning to Ānanda,<br />
					the brahmin next asked<br />
					where he was living<br />
					and was told it was in the Bamboo-grove;<br />
					he also asked whether the grove was pleasant<br />
					and free from voices and noise,<br />
					sheltered from winds,<br />
					and favourable to meditation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, indeed, brahmin, -<br />
					as befits rangers and wardens (Gopaka) like yourself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, indeed, Ānanda, -<br />
					as befits reverend men<br />
					who practise Ecstasies<br />
					and engage therein.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, such men engage in Ecstasy and practise it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Gotama<br />
					was staying at the Gabled Hall<br />
					in the Great Wood of Vesāli,<br />
					I went to him<br />
					and heard him speak of Ecstasy in many a figure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He Both <a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> practised Ecstasy<br />
					and engaged in it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He was an advocate of all Ecstasy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord, brahmin, did not advocate all Ecstasy<br />
					nor did he contemn all Ecstasy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What kind <a id="pt14" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg14"><span class="f2">[14]</span></a> of Ecstasy did he contemn? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man<br />
					whose heart is swayed and dominated by passion<br />
					and who has no real knowledge<br />
					of a true refuge from the passion within him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Inside his heart he hugs passion,<br />
					as in Ecstasy he muses<br />
					and bemuses,<br />
					un-muses<br />
					and de-bemuses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same holds good<br />
					if his heart is swayed and dominated by spite,<br />
					torpor,<br />
					flurry and worry,<br />
					or doubt.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It was this kind of Ecstasy<br />
					that the Lord contemned.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The kind of Ecstasy<br />
					which the Lord advocated was when,<br />
					divested of lusts and wrong dispositions,<br />
					an Almsman develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This goes to show<br />
					that he blamed blameworthy Ecstasy<br />
					and praised the praiseworthy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And now, Ānanda,<br />
					I must be going;<br />
					for I am busy and have much to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At your own good time, brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt15" href="../../pali/mn/mn.108.pali.bd.htm#pg15"><span class="f2">[15]</span></a> So with grateful thanks for whatĀnanda had said,<br />
					tne brahmin Vassakāra rose up<br />
					and went his way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He had not been gone long<br />
					before the brahmin Gopaka-Moggallāna said; -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The reverend Ānanda has not however answered the question I put to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Did I not tell you, brahmin,<br />
					that there was no single Almsman<br />
					who in every respect<br />
					and in every particular<br />
					possessed all the qualities possessed by the Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And that because the Lord made a Path<br />
					where Path there was none,<br />
					traced out a Path<br />
					till then unrevealed;<br />
					he knew and saw the Path;<br />
					master of the Path was he.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To-day his disciples follow him<br />
					in the Path which has come down to them from him.</p>
