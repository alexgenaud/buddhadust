					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in Vesālī,<br />
					in the Hall of many Storeys,<br />
					a host of Almsmen in the Lord's presence<br />
					declared their progress in the words: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					we have lived the highest life;<br />
					our task is done;<br />
					for us there is now no more of what we have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This came to the ears of Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />
					who came to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					sat down to one side,<br />
					saying he had heard of these numerous Almsmen's declaration of progress,<br />
					and asking the Lord whether they had really won all they professed<br />
					or whether some of the Almsmen were extravagant in their professions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Some of them have really won what they profess,<br />
					whilst others are extravagant in their professions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As regards the latter,<br />
					the Truth-finder decides to instruct them in the Doctrine<br />
					and deals with them accordingly,<br />
					- as, moreover, he does with foolish persons<br />
					who frame questions<br />
					with which <a id="pt253" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg253"><span class="f2">[253]</span></a> they trouble him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now is the time for that. Lord;<br />
					now is the time for that, Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The lesson the Lord teaches<br />
					will be listened to<br />
					and treasured up in the Almsmen's memories.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then listen and pay attention, Sunakkhatta;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sir,<br />
					said Sunakkhatta the Licchavi,<br />
					to whom the Lord thus began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Five strands make up pleasures of sense, -<br />
					visible shapes to be discerned by the eye,<br />
					sounds to be discerned by the ear,<br />
					odours to be discerned by the nostrils,<br />
					tastes to be discerned by the tongue,<br />
					and touch to be discerned by the body at large, -<br />
					all of them delightful pleasant agreeable and attractive,<br />
					all of them pleasurable and fraught with lusts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual's heart<br />
					is set on material things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> As he is,<br />
					so is his conversation;<br />
					to this pattern<br />
					his thoughts and ideas conform;<br />
					he looks up to a kindred soul<br />
					and rejoices in him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When talk turns on Permanence,<br />
					he does not listen or give ear,<br />
					nor yearn to learn about it,<br />
					nor does he look up to<br />
					or rejoice in the man who does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man<br />
					long absent from his village or township<br />
					were to meet another<br />
					just come from there<br />
					and were by enquiry of him<br />
					to be assured that the place was going on well<br />
					with plenty of food and little sickness about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt254" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg254"><span class="f2">[254]</span></a> What think you, Sunakkhatta?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would the man listen<br />
					and give ear<br />
					and yearn to learn?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would he look up to<br />
					and rejoice in the other?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even so, an individual's heart<br />
					may be set on worldly things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is,<br />
					so is his conversation;<br />

					his thoughts and ideas conform;<br />

					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual's heart<br />
					is set on Permanence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is,<br />

					his thoughts and ideas conform;<br />

					<p class="f4">When talk turns on worldly things,<br />
					he does not listen or give ear,<br />
					nor yearn to learn about them,<br />
					nor does he look up to<br />
					and rejoice in the man who does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a sere and yellow leaf<br />
					loosed from its stalk<br />
					can never be green again,<br />
					even so is one whose heart<br />
					is set on Permanence<br />
					and who is loosed from the pursuit of worldly things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is to be known<br />
					as the man from worldly bondage free,<br />
					whose heart is set on Permanence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual's heart<br />
					is set on the Realm of Naught.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is,<br />
					so is his conversation;<br />
					to this pattern<br />
					his thoughts and ideas conform;<br />
					he looks up to a kindred soul<br />
					and rejoices <a id="pt255" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg255"><span class="f2">[255]</span></a> in him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When talk turns on Permanence,<br />
					he does not listen or give ear,<br />
					nor does he yearn to learn about it,<br />
					nor does he look up to<br />
					and rejoice in the man who does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a rock<br />
					that is broken in twain<br />
					can never be put together again,<br />
					even so is it with the man<br />
					who has broken the bonds of Permanence,<br />
					and cleaves to the <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> Realm of Naught.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is to be known<br />
					as the man from Permanence free,<br />
					whose heart is set on the Realm of Naught.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual's heart<br />
					is set on Neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is,<br />
					so is his conversation;<br />
					to this pattern<br />

					he looks up to a kindred soul<br />

					<p class="f4">When talk turns on the Realm of Naught,<br />
					he does not listen or give ear,<br />
					nor does he yearn to learn about it,<br />
					nor does he look up to<br />

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who,<br />
					after a dainty meal,<br />
					throws away the scraps.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Think you he would long to return thereto?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir,<br />
					because it is thought nasty.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					the man whose heart is set on Neither-perception-nor-non-perception<br />
					has thrown away the bonds<br />
					of the Realm of Naught<br />
					and is to be known as the man free from the Realm of Naught,<br />
					whose heart is set on Neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual's heart<br />
					is set on supreme Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is,<br />
					so is his conversation;<br />
					to this pattern<br />
					his thoughts and ideas conform;<br />
					he looks up to a kindred soul<br />

					<p class="f4">When talk turns on Neither-perception-nor-non perception,<br />
					<a id="pt256" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg256"><span class="f2">[256]</span></a> he does not listen or give ear,<br />
					nor does he yearn to learn about it,<br />
					nor does he look up to<br />
					and rejoice in the man who does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As a palm-tree with its crown lopped off<br />
					which can never grow again,<br />
					so is the man whose heart is set on supreme Nirvana<br />
					and who has lopped off the bonds<br />
					of Neither-per-ception-nor-non-perception, -<br />
					a thing without roots,<br />
					a bare site,<br />
					a thing tnat once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is to be known<br />
					as the man free from Neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					whose heart is set on supreme Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may be that an individual reflects that: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Recluse has said<br />
					that Craving is an arrow,<br />
					and that the virus of ignorance<br />
					racks a man with lustful desires and spite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For me Craving's arrows are no more;<br />
					the <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> virus of ignorance is gone;<br />
					my heart is set on supreme Nirvana!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he is thus puffed up<br />
					with his achievements,<br />
					he will take to what is not good<br />
					for one whose heart is set on supreme Nirvana; -<br />
					he will take to sights and sounds,<br />
					odours and tastes,<br />
					things of touch<br />
					and mental objects which are not good for him;<br />
					and in the end<br />
					passion will debase his heart<br />
					and his debasement of heart<br />
					will bring him either to death<br />
					or to deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					wounded by an arrow<br />
					thickly smeared with poison,<br />
					to whom his friends and kinsfolk bring a leech<br />
					versed in arrow-wounds;<br />
					and the leech opens up the orifice of the wound,<br />
					probes it,<br />
					<a id="pt257" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg257"><span class="f2">[257]</span></a> extracts the barb,<br />
					and, in the mistaken belief<br />
					that there is nothing poisonous left behind -<br />
					though there is, -<br />
					tells his patient that he has got the barb out<br />
					and that there is nothing poisonous left behind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But you are not out of danger,<br />
					he adds;<br />
					so diet yourself properly<br />
					and do not inflame the wound with improper food.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bathe and dress the wound<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					and by doing so<br />
					prevent the old blood from caking over the orifice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Don't be out in the wind and sun<br />
					so as to let the dust and dirt get in,<br />
					but tend your wound with care<br />
					so as to get it healed up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Says the patient to himself: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The barb is out<br />
					and there is nothing poisonous left behind,<br />
					and I am in no danger.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he sets to work<br />
					to diet himself improperly,<br />
					with the result that his wound is inflamed;<br />
					he does not bathe or dress his wound<br />
					from time to time,<br />
					with the result<br />
					that the old blood cakes round the orifice;<br />
					he is out and about in wind and sun,<br />
					with the result that the dust and dirt get in;<br />
					nor does he nurse and tend his wound<br />
					to heal it up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The joint consequence<br />
					of improper diet<br />
					and of the noisome effects of the poison left behind,<br />
					is to make his wound swell up<br />
					and bring him to death or deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Precisely in the same way<br />
					an Almsman may reflect that: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Recluse has said<br />
					that Craving is an arrow<br />
					and that the virus of ignorance<br />
					racks a man with lustful desires and spite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For me Craving's arrows are no more;<br />
					the virus of ignorance is gone;<br />

					he will take to sights and sounds,<br />
					odours and tastes,<br />
					things of touch<br />
					and mental objects which are not good for him;<br />
					and in the end<br />
					passion will debase his heart<br />
					and his debasement of heart<br />
					will bring him either to death<br />
					or to deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For death <a id="pt258" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg258"><span class="f2">[258]</span></a> it is, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					in the Rule <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> of the Noble One,<br />
					if an Almsman abandons his vocation<br />
					and reverts to the lower state (of the laity);<br />
					deadly woe it is<br />
					if an Almsman is guilty of depravity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or an Almsman may reflect that: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Recluse has said<br />
					that Craving is an arrow<br />
					and that the poisonous effects of ignorance<br />
					rack a man with lustful desires and spite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For me Craving's arrows are no more;<br />
					the poisonous effects of ignorance are gone;<br />
					and my heart is set on supreme Nirvana!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With his heart thus set on Nirvana,<br />
					he eschews what is not good<br />
					for one whose heart is so set; -<br />
					he eschews sights and sounds,<br />
					odours and tastes,<br />
					things of touch and mental objects<br />
					which are not good for him;<br />
					and in the end <a id="pt259" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg259"><span class="f2">[259]</span></a> passion will fail to debase his heart<br />
					and there is no debasement of heart<br />
					to bring him either to death or deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					wounded by an arrow<br />
					thickly smeared with poison,<br />
					to whom his friends and kinsfolk bring a leech<br />
					versed in arrow-wounds;<br />
					and the leech opens up the orifice of the wound,<br />
					probes it,<br />
					extracts the barb,<br />
					and, knowing there is nothing poisonous left behind,<br />
					tells his patient that he has got the barb out<br />
					and that there is nothing poisonous left behind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You are in no danger, he adds;<br />
					but diet yourself properly<br />
					and do not inflame the wound<br />
					with improper food.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bathe and dress the wound<br />
					from time to time,<br />

					<p class="f4">Don't be out in the wind and sun<br />

					<p class="f4">Says this patient to himself: -<br />
					The barb is out;<br />
					there is nothing poisonous left behind;<br />
					and I am in no danger.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nevertheless, he restricts himself to a diet<br />
					that is good for him,<br />
					and his wound does not get inflamed;<br />
					he bathes and dresses his wound<br />
					and carries out all the several directions of the leech, -<br />
					with the joint consequence<br />
					of careful diet<br />
					and of no poison being left behind,<br />
					that, with the closing up and healing of his wound,<br />
					he neither dies nor comes to deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Precisely in the same way<br />
					an Almsman may reflect that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Recluse has said<br />
					that Craving is an arrow<br />
					<a id="pt260" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg260"><span class="f2">[260]</span></a> and that the virus of ignorance<br />
					rack a man with lustful desires and spite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For me Craving's arrows are no more;<br />
					the poisonous effects of ignorance are gone;<br />
					and my heart is set on supreme Nirvana!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With his heart thus set on Nirvana,<br />
					he eschews what is not good<br />
					for one whose heart is so set; -<br />
					he eschews sights and sounds,<br />
					odours and tastes,<br />
					things of touch and mental objects<br />
					which are not good for him;<br />
					and in the end passion will fail to debase his heart<br />
					and <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> there is no debasement of heart<br />
					to bring him either to death or deadly woe.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have used this illustration<br />
					to explain what I mean, Sunakkhatta;<br />
					and my meaning is this: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The wound signifies the six sense-organs within;<br />
					ignorance is the poison;<br />
					Craving is the arrow;<br />
					the probe is mindfulness;<br />
					the surgeon's knife is Noble Understanding;<br />
					the leech is the Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman who is in such full control of his six sense-organs<br />
					as to see in attachments the root of Ill,<br />
					and therefore to detach himself<br />
					and to find Deliverance in eradicating attachments, -<br />
					such an Almsman cannot possibly<br />
					either surrender his body<br />
					or devote his thought<br />
					to attachments.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose there were a goblet,<br />
					fragrant and fair to view,<br />
					which was charged with poison;<br />
					and suppose there came along a man<br />
					fond of life and anxious to avoid death,<br />
					fond of pleasure and averse from pain; -<br />
					do you think he would drink of the goblet<br />
					if he knew it would bring him,<br />
					should he drink of it,<br />
					to death or deadly woe?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt261" href="../../pali/mn/mn.105.pali.bd.htm#pg261"><span class="f2">[261]</span></a>	Just in the same way, Sunakkhatta,<br />
					an Almsman who is in such full control of his six sense-organs<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose there were a venomous viper,<br />
					and suppose there came a man<br />
					fond of life and anxious to avoid death,<br />
					fond of pleasure and averse from pain;<br />
					do you think he would<br />
					with hand or toe<br />
					touch the viper<br />
					which he knew would bring him,<br />
					if it bit him,<br />
					to death or deadly woe?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Precisely in the same way,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					Sunakkhatta the Licchavi rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
