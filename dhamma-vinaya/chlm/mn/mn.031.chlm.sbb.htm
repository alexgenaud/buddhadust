					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the Giñjak-āvasatha (brick-hall) at Nādika,<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					were staying in Gosinga wood<br />
					where the sāl-trees stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">At eventide the Lord,<br />
					rising up from his meditations,<br />
					went to Gosinga,<br />
					but the keeper, seeing <a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> him approaching at a distance,<br />
					said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't go into this wood, recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Three young men are living there for their souls' good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not disturb them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing the keeper cautioning the Lord, Anuruddha said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Good keeper, do not warn off the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the Lord, our master, who has come!</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anuruddha went and told the two others to come along,<br />
					for their master, the Lord, had come.</p>

					<p class="f4">So all three advanced to meet him, -<br />
					one relieving him of his bowl and robe,<br />
					while another set a seat for him,<br />
					and the third brought water for his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting down on the seat set for him,<br />
					the Lord bathed his feet;<br />
					and when, after due obeisance,<br />
					the three had taken their seats to one side,<br />
					the Lord spoke thus to the reverend Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, is all well with you three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you getting on all right?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there no shortage of alms?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Lord; all is well with us;<br />
					we are getting on all right;<br />
					there is no shortage of alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, do you all live together in concord and amity,<br />
					without quarrels,<br />
					in harmony and unison,<br />
					viewing one another with eyes of affection?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, we do.</p>

					<p class="f4">How?</p>

					<p class="f4">I feel, sir, that it is a great thing for me,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					to have such fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I minister to my two reverend associates -<br />
					both openly and in secret -<br />
					with acts of love,<br />
					with words of love,<br />
					and with thoughts of love.</p>

					<p class="f4">My yearning -<br />
					and indeed my practice, too -<br />
					is to surrender my own will<br />
					and to live according to the will of my reverend associates.</p>

					<p class="f4">We have more than one body<br />
					but only one will, methinks.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Nandiya<br />
					and the venerable Kimbila<br />
					answered the Lord's question in precisely the same words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, very good, said the Lord to the three, -<br />
					going on to ask whether their lives<br />
					were strenuous and ardent<br />
					and purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, was their answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">How?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> <span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>Among us, the first back from collecting alms in the village<br />
					sets the seats ready,<br />
					and gets water to drink<br />
					and to wash up with,<br />
					together with the bowl for the pieces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should he find any rice over,<br />
					the last back eats it if he wants to,<br />
					or, if he does not want to,<br />
					throws it away where no grass grows<br />
					or in water where there are no living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He puts away the seats<br />
					and the water<br />
					and the bowl for the pieces,<br />
					and sweeps the refectory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoso sees empty the vessels for water to drink,<br />
					or to wash up with,<br />
					or for ablution after an occasion,<br />
					sees to filling them;<br />
					but if the weight is too heavy for him alone,<br />
					we sign with our hands for another to help,<br />
					without uttering a word for this purpose.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how our lives<br />
					are strenuous,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					and purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, very good, said the Lord to the three.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, tell me, he added,<br />
					in living lives thus strenuous, ardent, and purged of self,<br />
					have you risen beyond the ordinary<br />
					to any wholly noble excellence of well-being?</p>

					<p class="f4">How, sir, could it be otherwise with us?</p>

					<p class="f4">For as long as we will,<br />
					it is ours,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					to, enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the First -<br />
					the Second -<br />
					the Third -<br />
					and the Fourth Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each of these is,<br />
					beyond the ordinary,<br />
					a wholly noble excellence of wellbeing,<br />
					each in turn superior to its forerunner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pressed further by question after question,<br />
					the three told how,<br />
					by passing altogether beyond perceptions of material objects,<br />
					and by ceasing from perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					and by withdrawing attention from multiplicity,<br />
					it was theirs,<br />
					for as long as they would,<br />
					to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of space,<br />
					or, successively,<br />
					the planes of infinity of mind -<br />
					or of Naught -<br />
					or of neither perception nor nonperception; -<br />
					or, lastly,<br />
					by passing altogether beyond the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					to enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the cessation of all perception of <a id="pg151"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></a> things felt,<br />
					plenitude of knowledge giving them vision<br />
					and the Cankers within them being extirpated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each of these, said they, is, beyond the ordinary,<br />
					a wholly noble excellence of well-being,<br />
					each in turn superior to its forerunner.</p>

					<p class="f4">But beyond the last<br />
					we discern no other stage of well-being<br />
					higher or more excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, very good, said the Lord; -<br />
					higher stage there is none.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he proceeded by homily to instruct,<br />
					inform,<br />
					help onward,<br />
					and cheer forward those three, -<br />
					after which he arose and went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">After they had escorted the Lord on his way<br />
					and had come back again,<br />
					Nandiya and Kimbila said to Anuruddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">Have we ever told the reverend Anuruddha of our reaching this or that attainment,<br />
					that he represented all this to the Lord<br />
					up to the extirpation of the Cankers?</p>

					<p class="f4">No; you never told me of your attainments,<br />
					but my heart read the secrets of your hearts<br />
					and saw that it was so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, deities reported it to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I announced the fact to the Lord,<br />
					when questioned by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">There came to the Lord<br />
					the outlandish fairy named Dīgha,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who, after due obeisance,<br />
					stood to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing for the Vajjians,<br />
					a very great thing for the Vajjian race,<br />
					to have dwelling (in their country)<br />
					the Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					and these three young men,<br />
					the venerable Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila!</p>

					<p class="f4">These words of his<br />
					were taken up in turn<br />
					and shouted aloud<br />
					by the gods of earth,<br />
					by the gods of the Four Great Regents,<br />
					by the gods of the Thirty-three,<br />
					by the gods of Yama,<br />
					by the Tusita gods,<br />
					by the Nimmana-rati gods,<br />
					by the Para-nimmita-Vasavatti gods,<br />
					and lastly by the train of gods in the world of Brahma.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, in that single moment,<br />
					in that very instant, <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> these three reverend men became known<br />
					right up to the world of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite so, Dīgha; quite so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the family from which they went forth from home to homelessness,<br />
					will remember these three with believing hearts,<br />
					then long will that family too<br />
					enjoy weal and welfare, -<br />
					as also will their group of families,<br />
					their village,<br />
					their township,<br />
					their city,<br />
					and their country;<br />
					yea, also the whole of the Nobles,<br />
					and of the brahmins,<br />
					and of the middle-classes <i>(vessa),</i><br />
					and of the peasantry <i>(sudda)</i>;<br />
					yea, the whole universe<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind.</p>

					<p class="f4">See, Dīgha, how,<br />
					walking for the weal and welfare of folk<br />
					and in compassion for the world,<br />
					these three young men<br />
					enure to the good<br />
					and weal<br />
					and welfare<br />
					of gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the outlandish fairy named Dīgha<br />
					rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

							<p><b>S.B.E. XIII, pg. 325:</b> "At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Sâvatthi, in the Getavana, the garden of Anâthapindika. At that time a number of Bhikkhus, companions and friends of each other, entered upon Vassa in a certain district of the Kosala country. Now those Bhikkhus thought: 'What shall we do in order that we may keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and that we may not suffer from want of food?'</p>

							<p>2. Then those Bhikkhus thought: 'If we do not speak to or converse with each other, if he who comes back first from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, prepares seats, gets water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel1, cleans the slop-basin and gets it ready, and puts there (water to) drink and food,--</p>

							<p>3. 'And if he who comes back last from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, eats, if there is any food left (from the dinner of the other Bhikkhus) and if he desires to do so; and if he does not desire (to eat), throws it away at a place free from grass, or pours it away into water in which no living things are; puts away the water for washing the feet, the foot-stool, and the towel1; cleans the slop-basin and puts it away, puts the water and the food away, and sweeps the dining-room,--</p>

							<p>4. 'And if he, who sees a water-pot, or a bowl for food, or a vessel for evacuations, empty and void, puts it (into its proper place), and if he is not able to do so single-handed, calls some one else and puts it away with their united effort without uttering a word on that account,--thus shall we keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and not suffer from want of food.'</p>

							<p>5-7. And those Bhikkhus did not speak to or converse with each other. He who came back from the village from his alms-pilgrimage first, prepared seats (etc., as above, § 4, down to) without uttering a word on that account."</p>
