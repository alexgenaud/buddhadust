					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will expound to you Noble Right Concentration,<br />
					with the means thereto<br />
					and with its concomitants.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Listen and pay attention<br />
					and I will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Almsmen<br />
					the Lord thus began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is Noble Right Concentration,<br />
					with the means thereto<br />
					and its concomitants? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It means the focussing of the heart<br />
					with a sevenfold equipment<br />
					of Right Views,<br />
					Right Thoughts,<br />
					Right Speech,<br />
					Right Action,<br />
					Right Occupation,<br />
					Right Effort<br />
					and Right Mindfulness.|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">First and foremost come Right Views,<br />
					which consist in a man's conviction<br />
					that such and such views are wrong,<br />
					and that such and such views are right.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now what are wrong views? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are views that -<br />

					<p class="f4">What are right views? -|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are twofold, say I.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On the one hand there are right views<br />
					which are, however, accompanied by Cankers,<br />
					are mixed up with good works,<br />
					and lead to attachments.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On the other hand<br />
					there are Right Views which are Noble,<br />
					freed from Cankers,<br />
					transcending mundane things,<br />

					<p class="f4">Those right views<br />
					which are accompanied by Cankers,<br />

					that there is indeed such a thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of deeds good and bad;<br />
					that there are really such things<br />
					as this world and the next;<br />
					that there are really such things<br />
					as parents<br />
					and spontaneous generation elsewhere;<br />
					and that there are really such things<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who tread the right path<br />

					this and other worlds<br />

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					the Noble Right Views which are of the Path -<br />
					embracing comprehension,<br />
					the faculty of comprehension,<br />
					the might of comprehension,<br />
					the factor of enlightenment<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt76" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg76"><span class="f2">[76]</span></a> If a. man has really <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> Right Views,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus the Almsman under training<br />
					has eight stages to go<br />

					<p class="f4">Right Views come first.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If a man has really Right Views,<br />
					for him wrong views are ended;<br />
					ended too for him<br />

					<p class="f4">If a man has really Right Thoughts,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus, if we add its train<br />

					by any god or Māra or Brahmā,<br />
					or in any universe whatsoever.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If any recluse or brahmin<br />

					the result to him is that,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					he relegates to the <a id="pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a> sphere of the erroneous<br />
					ten utterances,<br />

					<p class="f4">If the good man rejects Right Views,<br />

					occupation,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the result to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not so the men of Ukkala,<br />
					Vassa and Bhañña.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Albeit these two believed<br />
					in neither cause nor consequence<br />

					they would not regard with contumely and scorn<br />
					the Exposition of the Great Forty.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Through their fear of blame,<br />
					reproach and censure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
