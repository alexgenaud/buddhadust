					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will expound to you Noble Right Concentration,<br />
					with the means thereto<br />
					and with its concomitants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay attention<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Almsmen<br />
					the Lord thus began: -</p>

					<p class="f4">What is Noble Right Concentration,<br />
					with the means thereto<br />
					and its concomitants? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It means the focussing of the heart<br />
					with a sevenfold equipment<br />
					of Right Views,<br />
					Right Thoughts,<br />
					Right Speech,<br />
					Right Action,<br />
					Right Occupation,<br />
					Right Effort<br />
					and Right Mindfulness.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">First and foremost come Right Views,<br />
					which consist in a man's conviction<br />
					that such and such views are wrong,<br />
					and that such and such views are right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are wrong views? -</p>

					<p class="f4">They are views that -<br />
					there is no such thing<br />
					as alms<br />
					or sacrifice<br />
					or oblations;<br />
					that there is no such thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of deeds good and bad;<br />
					that there are no such things<br />
					as this world or the next;<br />
					that there are no such things<br />
					as either parents<br />
					or a spontaneous generation elsewhere;<br />
					<a id="pt72" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg72"><span class="f2">[72]</span></a> that there are no such things<br />

					who tread the right path<br />
					and walk aright,<br />
					who have,<br />
					of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized this<br />
					and other worlds<br />
					and make it all known to others.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">What are right views? -|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">They are twofold, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the one hand there are right views<br />
					which are, however, accompanied by Cankers,<br />
					are mixed up with good works,<br />
					and lead to attachments.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand<br />
					there are Right Views which are Noble,<br />
					freed from Cankers,<br />
					transcending mundane things,<br />
					and included in the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those right views<br />
					which are accompanied by Cankers,<br />
					are mixed up with good works,<br />
					and lead to attachments,<br />
					recognize that there are such things<br />
					as alms and sacrifice and oblations;<br />
					that there is indeed such a thing<br />
					as the fruit and harvest<br />
					of deeds good and bad;<br />
					that there are really such things<br />
					as this world and the next;<br />
					that there are really such things<br />
					as parents<br />
					and spontaneous generation elsewhere;<br />
					and that there are really such things<br />
					as recluses and brahmins who tread the right path<br />
					and walk aright,<br />
					who have,<br />
					of and by themselves,<br />
					comprehended and realized<br />
					this and other worlds<br />
					and make it all known to others.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					the Noble Right Views which are of the Path -<br />
					embracing comprehension,<br />
					the faculty of comprehension,<br />
					the might of comprehension,<br />
					the factor of enlightenment<br />
					which comes from a critical study of the Doctrine,<br />
					in the man whose heart is noble<br />
					and free of Cankers,<br />
					who is of the Noble Path<br />
					and who is imbued with it<br />
					and has developed it within him -<br />
					these Right Views are styled<br />
					Right Views that are Noble,<br />
					freed from Cankers,<br />
					transcending mundane things<br />
					and included in the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right Effort is his<br />
					whose aim is to eschew wrong views<br />
					and to foster right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right Mindfulness is his<br />
					as, in mindfulness,<br />
					he eschews wrong views<br />
					and fosters right views. -</p>

					<p class="f4">These three qualities of right views,<br />
					right effort<br />

					and move them on and on.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> In thought too<br />
					Right Views come first,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt73" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg73"><span class="f2">[73]</span></a> Now, what are wrong thoughts? -</p>

					<p class="f4">They are lustful thoughts,<br />
					spiteful thoughts<br />
					and cruel thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are right thoughts? -</p>

					<p class="f4">They too are twofold, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the one hand,<br />

					and included in the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those right thoughts<br />
					which are accompanied by Cankers,<br />
					are mixed up with good works<br />
					and tend to attachments,<br />
					include thoughts of Renunciation,<br />
					thoughts void of spite<br />
					and thoughts void of cruelty.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					Noble Right Thoughts<br />
					which are of the Path -<br />
					embracing reason and reasoning;<br />
					thought with its conceivings and conceptions,<br />
					application of the mind<br />
					and utterance of speech,<br />
					in the man whose heart is noble<br />
					and free of Cankers,<br />
					who is of the Noble Path<br />

					and has developed it within him -,<br />
					these Right Thoughts are styled<br />
					Right Thoughts that are Noble,<br />

					<p class="f4">To him whose aim is to eschew wrong thoughts<br />
					and to foster right thoughts, -<br />
					unto him comes Right Effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in mindfulness he eschews wrong thoughts<br />
					and fosters right thoughts,<br />
					unto him comes Right Mindfulness. -</p>

					<p class="f4">These three qualities<br />

					right effort<br />
					and right mindfulness<br />
					revolve round Right Thoughts<br />
					and move them on and on.</p>

					<p class="f4">In speech too<br />
					Right Views come first,<br />
					with their conviction<br />
					that such and such speech is wrong<br />
					and that such and such speech is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what is wrong speech? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is lying,<br />
					a spiteful tongue,<br />
					a savage tongue,<br />
					and chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is right speech? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It too is twofold, say I.</p>

					of savage words<br />
					and of chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the other hand,<br />
					Noble Right Speech which is of the Path -<br />
					embracing abstinence<br />
					and abstention<br />
					and abstaining<br />
					and avoidance<br />
					in the matter of the four forms<br />
					of misconduct of speech,<br />
					on the part of the man<br />
					whose heart is noble and free of Cankers,<br />
					who is of the Noble Path<br />

					<p class="f4">In deeds too<br />
					Right Views come first,<br />
					with their conviction<br />
					that such and such an action is wrong<br />
					and that such and such an action is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what is a wrong action? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is taking life,<br />
					not giving alms,<br />
					sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is a right action? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is twofold, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">In livelihoods too<br />
					Right Views come first,<br />
					with their conviction<br />
					that such an occupation is wrong<br />
					and that such and such an occupation is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what is a wrong occupation? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is cozening<br />

					<p class="f4">What is a right occupation? -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is twofold, say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the one hand,<br />
					there is right occupation<br />

					<p class="f4">Right Mindfulness is his<br />
					as in mindfulness<br />
					he eschews wrong occupation<br />
					and fosters right occupation. -</p>

					<p class="f4">These three qualities<br />
					of right views,<br />
					right effort<br />
					and right mindfulness<br />
					revolve round Right Occupation<br />
					and move it on and on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right Views come first.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt76" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg76"><span class="f2">[76]</span></a> If a. man has really <a id="pg198"><span class="f2 g"><b>[198]</b></span></a> Right Views,<br />
					Right Thoughts are operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Thoughts,<br />
					Right Speech is operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Speech,<br />
					Right Action is operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Action,<br />
					Right Occupation is operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Occupation,<br />
					Right Mindfulness is operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Mindfulness,<br />
					Right Concentration is operative;<br />
					if he has really Right Concentration,<br />
					Right Knowledge is operative;<br />
					and if he has really Right Knowledge,<br />
					then Right Deliverance is effectual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the Almsman under training<br />
					has eight stages to go<br />
					and the arahat ten.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right Views come first.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man has really Right Views,<br />
					for him wrong views are ended;<br />
					ended too for him<br />
					are the hosts of bad and wrong dispositions<br />
					which grow up in the train of wrong views,<br />
					while, as the train of right views,<br />
					hosts of right dispositions<br />
					march on to perfected development.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man has really Right Thoughts,<br />
					for him wrong thoughts are ended;<br />
					ended too for him<br />
					are the hosts of bad and wrong dispositions<br />
					which grow up as the train of wrong thoughts,<br />
					while hosts of right dispositions<br />
					march on to perfected development.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man has really Right Speech -<br />
					Right Action -<br />
					Right Occupation -<br />
					<a id="pt77" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg77"><span class="f2">[77]</span></a> Right Effort -<br />
					Right Mindfulness -<br />
					Right Concentration -<br />
					Right Knowledge -<br />
					Right Deliverance -<br />
					for him in each case the converse is ended;<br />
					ended too for him<br />
					are the hosts of bad and wrong dispositions<br />
					which respectively grow up<br />
					as the train of that converse,<br />
					while hosts of right dispositions<br />
					march on to perfected development.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, if we add its train<br />
					to each of the preceding tens<br />
					there are a score arrayed for the right<br />
					and a score for the wrong;<br />
					and so there has been set afoot<br />
					the Exposition of the Great Forty,<br />
					which could never be set afoot<br />
					by any recluse or brahmin,<br />
					by any god or Māra or Brahmā,<br />
					or in any universe whatsoever.</p>

					<p class="f4">If any recluse or brahmin<br />
					thinks this Exposition of the Great Forty<br />
					matter for contumely and scorn,<br />
					the result to him is that,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					he relegates to the <a id="pg199"><span class="f2 g"><b>[199]</b></span></a> sphere of the erroneous<br />
					ten utterances,<br />
					major and minor,<br />
					of the Doctrine. -</p>

					<p class="f4">If the good man rejects Right Views,<br />
					he reveres and extols<br />
					the recluses and brahmins with wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he rejects Right Thoughts,<br />
					<a id="pt78" href="../../pali/mn/mn.117.pali.bd.htm#pg78"><span class="f2">[78]</span></a> he reveres and extols<br />
					the recluses and brahmins with wrong thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same holds good for right and wrong<br />
					speech,<br />
					action,<br />
					occupation,<br />
					effort,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					Knowledge<br />
					and Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not so the men of Ukkala,<br />
					Vassa and Bhañña.</p>

					<p class="f4">Albeit these two believed<br />
					in neither cause nor consequence<br />
					and were nihilists,<br />
					they would not regard with contumely and scorn<br />
					the Exposition of the Great Forty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Through their fear of blame,<br />
					reproach and censure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
