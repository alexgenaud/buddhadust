<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 37. A well-known and much loved sutta. Sakka, Ruler of the Devas, visits the Buddha and asks about the scope of understanding required of one to be able to know he is arahant. The Buddha instructs him, but Maha Moggallāna, who was listening, doubts it has sunk in and visits Sakka in the Tavatimsa Realm. There he is put off with frivolities and in order to rouse Sakka to seriousness Maha Moggallāna shakes Sakka's palace with his big toe. With his hair standing on end, Sakka gets down to business." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in the Old Pleasaunce in the palace of Migāra's Mother,<br />
					there came to him Sakka, king of gods, who,<br />
					taking a seat to one side after salutations,<br />
					asked how, briefly,<br />
					an Almsman became Delivered<br />
					by the extirpation of cravings,<br />
					so as to become consummate in perfection,<br />
					consummate in his union with peace,<br />
					consummate in the higher life,<br />
					consummate in his bourne,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					foremost among gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, king of gods,<br />
					of an Almsman who has been taught<br />
					that there should never be any inclination<br />
					towards any mental state whatsoever.</p>

					<p class="f4">So taught, he apprehends all such mental states,<br />
					and, by apprehending,<br />
					comprehends them,<br />
					and, by comprehending,<br />
					views every feeling which he experiences -<br />
					be it pleasant,<br />
					or unpleasant<br />
					or neither -<br />
					with a sense of its impermanence,<br />
					without passion for them,<br />
					with an eye to their cessation,<br />
					<br />
					and with an eye to renouncing them all,<br />
					so that, in the result,<br />
					he clings on to nothing in the world<br />
					and thereby is undismayed,<br />
					and, being undismayed,<br />
					individually wins Nirvana for himself -<br />
					with the conviction that for him<br />
					re-birth is no more;<br />
					that he has greatly lived;<br />
					that his task is done;<br />
					and that there is no more of what he has been.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, king of gods, is how, briefly,<br />
					an Almsman <a id="pg181"><span class="f2 g"><b>[l8l]</b></span></a> becomes Delivered ...<br />
					foremost among gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, expressing satisfaction and gratitude<br />
					for what he had heard,<br />
					Sakka, king of gods, saluted the Lord with deep reverence<br />
					and vanished then and there.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Mahā-Moggallāna,<br />
					who at the time was seated near the Lord,<br />
					inwardly wondered whether or not that fairy,<br />
					in expressing gratitude,<br />
					had really grasped what the Lord had told him,<br />
					and resolved to find out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his arm<br />
					or draw back his outstretched arm,<br />
					Moggallāna vanished from the palace of Migara's Mother<br />
					and appeared among the Thirty-Three gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sakka, who at the moment<br />
					was taking his pleasure in the Lotus Pleasaunce<br />
					with five hundred instruments<br />
					discoursing heavenly music around him,<br />
					no sooner saw the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna in the distance<br />
					than he stopped the music<br />
					and going towards him said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Approach, Your Excellency;<br />
					welcome to Your Excellency;<br />
					it is a long time since Your Excellency managed to come here;<br />
					pray be seated, Your Excellency;<br />
					here is a seat set for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna took his seat accordingly,<br />
					and then Sakka, king of gods, seated himself<br />
					on a lower seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they were thus seated,<br />
					Moggallāna said to Sakka:</p>

					<p class="f4">How did the Lord, Kosiya,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> briefly expound to you<br />
					Deliverance by the extirpation of cravings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray let me too<br />
					share in that discourse<br />
					so that I may hear it.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have much to do and attend to, Your Excellency,<br />
					both on my own account<br />
					and on that of the Thirty-Three.</p>

					<p class="f4">I duly heard it all<br />
					and took it in;<br />
					I duly pondered it over<br />
					and stored it up in my memory;<br />
					nor will it soon fade away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Time was, Your Excellency,<br />
					when war arose between the gods and the <a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> Asuras (titans);<br />
					and in the conflict the gods won,<br />
					and the Asuras were worsted.</p>

					<p class="f4">On my triumphant return from that conflict,<br />
					I called into being the Palace of Victory (Vejayanta), -<br />
					which has a hundred towers,<br />
					each seven hundred stories high,<br />
					and in each story there are seven nymphs,<br />
					each with her seven attendants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would not Your Excellency like to see<br />
					the delights of the Palace of Victory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Moggallāna having expressed assent by silence,<br />
					Sakka, king of gods, and King Vessavana,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					preceded by Moggallāna,<br />
					proceeded to the Palace of Victory.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight of Moggallāna in the distance,<br />
					Sakka's handmaidens fled in fear and shame<br />
					each to her own apartment, -<br />
					just as a young wife is filled with fear and shame<br />
					at the sight of her husbands father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sakka and Vessavana conducted Moggallāna through the palace<br />
					and walked him all over it,<br />
					pointing out its successive delights to His Excellency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, said Moggallāna,<br />
					it is as splendid as it should be,<br />
					in view of the venerable Kosiya's merit in the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mortals, too, jubilantly exclaim,<br />
					at sight of anything delightful,<br />
					that it is as splendid as the Thirty-Three;<br />
					and this is as splendid as it should be,<br />
					in view of the venerable Kosiya's merit in the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought Moggallāna:</p>

					<p class="f4">This fairy is inflated (about his palace);<br />
					I had better give him a shock.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he wrought a work of magic<br />
					whereby his big toe<br />
					set the Palace of Victory<br />
					shaking and quaking and rocking.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this, Sakka, King of gods,<br />
					and King Vessavana,<br />
					and all the gods of the heaven of the Thirty-Three,<br />
					wondered and marvelled, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">A wonder and a marvel indeed<br />
					is the magic power and potency of this recluse,<br />
					who with his big toe<br />
					can set this heavenly mansion<br />
					shaking and quaking and rocking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Marking how agitated Sakka was<br />
					and how his hair was standing on end,<br />
					Moggallāna said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Now how did <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> the Lord, Kosiya,<br />
					briefly expound to you Deliverance<br />
					by the extirpation of cravings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray let me too<br />
					share in that discourse<br />
					so that I may hear it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, at last, Sakka, king of gods, told -<br />
					word for word -<br />
					how he had gone to question the Lord<br />
					and what answer had been given him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the reverend -Mahā Moggallāna,<br />
					after expressing his satisfaction and thanks to Sakka,<br />
					vanished away<br />
					to reappear in the Old Pleasaunce<br />
					in the palace of Migara's Mother, -<br />
					as readily as a strong man might stretch out his arm<br />
					or draw back his outstretched arm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after Moggallāna had gone,<br />
					Sakka's handmaidens asked the king of gods,<br />
					whether that was the Lord, his master.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, he replied;<br />
					it was one who is a fellow with me in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing, Your Excellency,<br />
					to have in the higher life<br />
					a fellow-seeker of such magical power and potency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! what a Master you have in the Lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Approaching and saluting the Lord, Moggallāna<br />
					took his seat to one side,<br />
					asking whether the Lord was aware<br />
					of having briefly expounded lately<br />
					to a fairy of distinction<br />
					Deliverance by the extirpation of cravings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, the Lord remembered it quite well;<br />
					and ... recounted-word for word -<br />
					to Moggallāna<br />
					Sakka's question<br />
					and the answer he had himself given -<br />
					to shew how, briefly,<br />
					an Almsman becomes Delivered ...<br />
					foremost among gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Mahā-Moggallāna rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
