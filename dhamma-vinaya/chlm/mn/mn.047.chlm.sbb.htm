					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">The enquiring Almsman<br />
					who searches the hearts of others,<br />
					ought to study the truth-finder.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord is the root<br />
					and the guide<br />
					and the basis of all our ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">We beg that the Lord may be moved to expound the meaning of his utterance,<br />
					so that we may treasure up what we hear from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then listen and pay attention,<br />
					and I will <a id="pg228"><span class="f2 g"><b>[228]</b></span></a> speak, said the Lord,<br />
					who then went on to address the listening Almsmen, as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">The enquiring Almsman<br />
					who searches the hearts of others<br />
					ought to study the truth-finder<br />
					in respect of the two states of consciousness<br />
					which come through eye and ear,<br />
					so as to ascertain whether<br />
					in the truth-finder<br />
					they occur in a corrupt form or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he studies,<br />
					he comes to know<br />
					that no corrupt forms of these occur.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pursuing his study,<br />
					he comes to know<br />
					that in the truth-finder<br />
					such states do not occur in a mixed form.</p>

					<p class="f4">By pursuing his study still further,<br />
					he comes to know<br />
					that in the truth-finder<br />
					these states of consciousness alone occur<br />
					which are wholly pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He proceeds to examine<br />
					whether this reverend man<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> has risen long since<br />
					or only recently to this excellence;<br />
					and he comes to know<br />
					that he rose thereto long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence he goes on to examine<br />
					whether this reverend man<br />
					has grown popular<br />
					and is famous,<br />
					and whether certain perils beset him.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, Almsmen, such perils do not beset an Almsman,<br />
					so long as he has not grown popular<br />
					and so long as he is not famous;<br />
					they beset him only after he has grown popular<br />
					and is famous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Examination shows that this reverend man<br />
					is popular and famous,<br />
					but that these perils do not beset him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then comes the further examination<br />
					to settle whether the reverend man<br />
					refrains in fearlessness<br />
					or through fear,<br />
					or whether it is solely by reason of passionlessness<br />
					that he eschews pleasures of sense,<br />
					having eradicated all passion;<br />
					and this examination shows<br />
					that the eradication of passion<br />
					is the reason why he eschews pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should the enquiring Almsman be asked by others<br />
					what facts and evidence lead him to aver<br />
					that this reverend man eschews pleasures of sense<br />
					in fearlessness<br />
					and not from motives of fear,<br />
					but because of the eradication of passion,<br />
					then he would give the right answer<br />
					by replying that,<br />
					whether living <a id="pg229"><span class="f2 g"><b>[229]</b></span></a> in the Confraternity or alone,<br />
					this reverend man -<br />
					alike in dealing with rich and poor,<br />
					with teachers of confraternities,<br />
					with those patently covetous<br />
					or with those by covetise undefiled -<br />
					never looks down on a man for that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Face to face,<br />
					and from the Lord's own lips,<br />
					have I been assured<br />
					that he refrains in fearlessness,<br />
					and not through fears,<br />
					and that it is solely by reason of passionlessness<br />
					that he eschews pleasures of sense,<br />
					having eradicated all passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, the truth-finder himself<br />
					should be asked the direct questions<br />
					whether in him the states of consciousness<br />
					which come through sight and hearing occur<br />
					(a) in a corrupt form,<br />
					(b) in a mixed form, or<br />
					(c) in entire purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, answering aright,<br />
					the truth-finder will answer<br />
					that these states occur<br />
					never in a corrupt or mixed form<br />
					but always in entire purity; -<br />
					this is the track I tread,<br />
					this is the realm in which I move,<br />
					and therewithal I harbour no cravings.</p>

					<p class="f4">When such are a teachers words,<br />
					a disciple is right to go to him<br />
					for instruction in his Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">That teacher expounds the Doctrine, -<br />
					more and more,<br />
					higher still and higher,<br />
					until at last it embraces<br />
					all that is foul<br />
					and all that is fair,<br />
					with all their mutual antagonism.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as the teacher gradually thus expounds the Doctrine,<br />
					so gradually therein does that Almsman,<br />
					by insight into this or that state of consciousness,<br />
					reach perfection in them all,<br />
					and win the belief in his teacher that -<br />
					the Lord is all-enlightened;<br />
					right well has he made his Doctrine known;<br />
					his Confraternity walks in righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If others should ask him<br />
					on what facts and evidence he bases this belief,<br />
					then, if he gives the right answer,<br />
					he would reply that,<br />
					as the teacher gradually expounded the Doctrine,<br />
					so gradually therein had he,<br />
					by insight into this or that state of consciousness,<br />
					reached perfection in them all<br />
					and won the belief in his teacher<br />
					which made him say that the Lord was all-enlightened,<br />
					that right well had he made his Doctrine known,<br />
					and that his Confraternity walked in righteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">If any man's faith in the truth-finder is planted,<br />
					rooted,<br />
					and <a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a> established by the foregoing researches<br />
					and in the foregoing sentences<br />
					and in the foregoing words,<br />
					then such faith is styled reasoned,<br />
					based on insight,<br />
					assured, -<br />
					impregnable to recluse or brahmin,<br />
					god,<br />
					Māra,<br />
					Brahmā<br />
					or anyone else in the universe.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Almsmen, is the way<br />
					to study a truth-finder's states of consciousness;<br />
					and it is thus that the truth-finder is studied aright<br />
					in the laws of his being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
