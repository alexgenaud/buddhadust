The Buddha is not able to halt the argument and contention of the sangha in Ghosita's vihara in Kosambī and so moves on to Visit Bhago in Balakallonakara village where he teaches him Dhamma and then he visits the Anuruddhas staying in the Eastern Bamboo Grove there.

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Kosambī<br />
					in the Ghosita pleasaunce,<br />
					disputes were rife there among the Almsmen,<br />
					who were living in a state<br />
					of uproar and contention,<br />
					darting taunts at one another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This was <a id="pt153" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg153"><span class="f2">[153]</span></a> reported by an Almsman to the Lord,<br />
					with the prayer that<br />
					he would vouchsafe to go to these Almsmen;<br />
					and the Lord, giving consent by silence,<br />
					went thither and said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Enough, Almsmen!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No altercations,<br />
					no contentions,<br />
					no strife,<br />
					no disputes!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said an Almsman to the Lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let be, o author of the Doctrine!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let the Lord dwell in the enjoyment<br />
					of his bliss here and now!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ours will be the notoriety<br />
					for these altercations,<br />
					contentions,<br />
					strife and disputes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second and a third time<br />
					did the Lord say this to these Almsmen;<br />
					and a second and a third time<br />
					did that Almsman beg him not to interfere.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord went into Kosambī for alms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					on his return from his round,<br />
					the Lord packed up his bedding and,<br />
					still standing,<br />
					uttered the following verses:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt154" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg154"><span class="f2">[154]</span></a> When all in chorus bawl, none feels a fool;<br />
							nor, though the Order fall, thinks otherwise;<br />
							misunderstanding wisdom's words, they bawl,<br />
							these loud word-mongers, for - they know not what.<br />
							Me he reviled; he beat, robbed, plunder'd me!<br />
							- such thoughts, if harbour'd, ne'er let hatred die;<br />
							but hatred dies, when these no harbour find.<br />
							<a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> Hate ne'er stopped hate; the ancient law holds good, -<br />
							when hate no longer answers hate, hate dies.<br />
							Some cannot see their broils will bring them low;<br />
							- others perceive the danger and stop strife.<br />
							Ruffians who maim and kill, steal cattle steeds<br />
							and pelf, who plunder realms, - in concord dwell.<br />
							- Why should not you?<br />
							If fortune grant a trusty, staunch, true friend,<br />
							with him face dangers gladly, mindfully.<br />
							If fortune grant you no such trusty friend,<br />
							go forth alone, - as monarchs go whose realms<br />
							are lost, as elephant in lonely glade;<br />
							go forth alone, iniquity eschew,<br />
							carefree as elephant in lonely glade.</p>
							
					<p class="f4">When the Lord, still standing,<br />
					had uttered these verses,<br />
					he departed for the village of Bālaka-loṇaka<br />
					where at the time <a id="pt155" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg155"><span class="f2">[155]</span></a> the reverend Bhagu was sojourning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing the Lord coming some way off<br />
					Bhagu set out a seat<br />
					and got water for the feet.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, with due salutations,<br />
					Bhagu had sat down to one side,<br />
					the Lord, after asking him<br />
					whether all was going well with him<br />
					and after learning that all went well,<br />
					proceeded by homily to instruct,<br />
					inform,<br />
					enlighten<br />
					and hearten Bhagu.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he rose up and departed to Pācīna-vaɱsa-dāya, where at the time<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were living.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The forest-guard who, at a distance,<br />
					had seen the Lord coming,<br />
					said to the Lord:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Don't go in there,<br />
					recluse ... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.031.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 31,</a> down to)</i><br />
					... <a id="pt156" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg156"><span class="f2">[156-7]</span></a> to ask the three whether,<br />
					in leading such a life,<br />
					they reached any other state of pure well-being,<br />
					quite out of the ordinary<br />
					and beyond the scope of man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Leading a life that is strenuous,<br />
					ardent and purged of self,<br />
					we get, sir (in our Ecstasy exercises),<br />
					the aura <i>(obhāsa)</i><br />
					and the apperception <i>(dassana)</i> of Form;<br />
					but they soon fade away;<br />
					and we cannot get the mental reflex <i>(nimitta)</i>.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But you must, said the. Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I myself too, in <a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> the days before Enlightenment,<br />
					when I was only a Bodhisatta<br />
					without full Enlightenment,<br />
					got the aura and the apperception of Form;<br />
					but they <a id="pt158" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg158"><span class="f2">[158]</span></a> soon faded away,<br />
					and I asked myself why they did.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then thought I: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Doubts have arisen within me<br />
					and consequently mental concentration has passed away<br />
					and with it the aura and the apperception;<br />
					I will take measures<br />
					to stop such doubts from arising in future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Leading the strenuous and ardent life<br />
					purged of self,<br />
					I recovered the phenomena;<br />
					but soon they left me again,<br />
					and, on asking myself why they left me,<br />
					I concluded that it was because<br />
					intellectual shortcomings had occurred<br />
					and consequently mental concentration had passed away<br />
					and the phenomena with it,<br />
					and that I must take measures<br />
					to stop such doubts and such intellectual shortcomings<br />
					from arising in future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as with (1) doubts and<br />
					(2) intellectual shortcomings,<br />
					so, successively and cumulatively,<br />
					I dealt with -<br />
					(3) flurry and worry,<br />
					(4) palsied fear, -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as palsy would arise<br />
					in a traveller on a long journey<br />
					if on either side murderers appeared,<br />
					so that palsy came on him<br />
					from right and from left, -<br />
					so did palsy arise within me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt159" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg159"><span class="f2">[159]</span></a> (5) elation, -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as elation would arise<br />
					in a man hunting for a buried hoard<br />
					if he came on five hoards all at once,<br />
					so did elation arise within me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(6) lewdness,<br />
					(7) excessive effort, -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a man grasping a quail<br />
					with might and main in both hands<br />
					would kill the bird,<br />
					such was the excessive effort<br />
					which arose within me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(8) slackness <a id="pt160" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg160"><span class="f2">[160]</span></a>, -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a quail would slip from the hand<br />
					of a man who held it in a loose and slack grasp,<br />
					such was the slackness which arose within me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(9) aspirations, and<br />
					(10) multiplicity in sensory perception.

					(11) Leading a life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I got the aura and the apperception of Form,<br />
					but they soon faded away,<br />
					and I asked myself <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> why they did.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then thought I: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Meticulous analysis of the phenomena has arisen within me<br />
					and consequently concentration has passed away<br />
					and with it the aura and apperception;<br />
					I will take measures<br />
					to stop this meticulosity of analysis too<br />
					from occurring in future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Realizing that each and every one<br />
					of these eleven things was a blemish,<br />
					I got rid of them all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt161" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg161"><span class="f2">[161]</span></a> Continuing a life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I got the aura<br />
					but could not see Forms,<br />
					or I could see Forms<br />
					but did not get the aura,<br />
					during the whole of the night<br />
					or day<br />
					or both.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thinking it over, I concluded that,<br />
					when my mind was engaged<br />
					on the mental reflex of the one,<br />
					it neglected the other.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Continuing the life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I succeeded in getting aura and apperception of Form,<br />
					now in a lesser degree<br />
					now in a boundless degree.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thinking it over,<br />
					I concluded that this turned on<br />
					the degree of my mental concentration; -<br />
					when my mental concentration was less,<br />
					my eye was less,<br />
					and with that lesser eye<br />
					I could only discern a lesser aura and lesser Forms;<br />
					whereas, when my mental concentration was boundess,<br />
					boundless too was my discernment<br />
					of these things<br />
					by night<br />
					or day<br />
					or both.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As soon as <a id="pt162" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg162"><span class="f2">[162]</span></a> I had got rid of each and every one<br />
					of the foregoing eleven things<br />
					which I perceived to be blemishes,<br />
					then, realizing that they were all gone from me,<br />
					I resolved to develop mental concentration<br />
					along three lines: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I developed it with the accompaniment of observation and reflection;<br />
					I developed it with the accompaniment of observation<br />
					but not of reflection;<br />
					I developed it with the accompaniment of neither.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I developed mental concentration<br />
					with zest<br />
					and without it;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I developed mental concentration in association with a sense of satisfaction;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I developed it in association with poised equanimity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As soon as I had developed mental concentration<br />
					in these several modes,<br />
					there arose in me<br />
					the knowledge and the vision<br />
					that my Deliverance was assured,<br />
					that this was my last exist- <a id="pg248"><span class="f2 g"><b>[248]</b></span></a> ence,<br />
					and that there was now no more<br />
					of what I had been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
