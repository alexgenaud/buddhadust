					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Kosambī<br />
					in the Ghosita pleasaunce,<br />
					disputes were rife there among the Almsmen,<br />
					who were living in a state<br />
					of uproar and contention,<br />
					darting taunts at one another.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was <a id="pt153" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg153"><span class="f2">[153]</span></a> reported by an Almsman to the Lord,<br />
					with the prayer that<br />
					he would vouchsafe to go to these Almsmen;<br />
					and the Lord, giving consent by silence,<br />
					went thither and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Enough, Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">No altercations,<br />
					no contentions,<br />
					no strife,<br />
					no disputes!</p>

					<p class="f4">Said an Almsman to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be, o author of the Doctrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Lord dwell in the enjoyment<br />
					of his bliss here and now!</p>

					<p class="f4">Ours will be the notoriety<br />
					for these altercations,<br />
					contentions,<br />
					strife and disputes.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second and a third time<br />
					did the Lord say this to these Almsmen;<br />
					and a second and a third time<br />
					did that Almsman beg him not to interfere.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord went into Kosambī for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					on his return from his round,<br />
					the Lord packed up his bedding and,<br />
					still standing,<br />
					uttered the following verses:<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt154" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg154"><span class="f2">[154]</span></a> When all in chorus bawl, none feels a fool;<br />
							nor, though the Order fall, thinks otherwise;<br />
							misunderstanding wisdom's words, they bawl,<br />
							these loud word-mongers, for - they know not what.<br />
							Me he reviled; he beat, robbed, plunder'd me!<br />
							- such thoughts, if harbour'd, ne'er let hatred die;<br />
							but hatred dies, when these no harbour find.<br />
							<a id="pg245"><span class="f2 g"><b>[245]</b></span></a> Hate ne'er stopped hate; the ancient law holds good, -<br />
							when hate no longer answers hate, hate dies.<br />
							Some cannot see their broils will bring them low;<br />
							- others perceive the danger and stop strife.<br />
							Ruffians who maim and kill, steal cattle steeds<br />
							and pelf, who plunder realms, - in concord dwell.<br />
							- Why should not you?<br />
							If fortune grant a trusty, staunch, true friend,<br />
							with him face dangers gladly, mindfully.<br />
							If fortune grant you no such trusty friend,<br />
							go forth alone, - as monarchs go whose realms<br />
							are lost, as elephant in lonely glade;<br />
							go forth alone, iniquity eschew,<br />
							carefree as elephant in lonely glade.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord, still standing,<br />
					had uttered these verses,<br />
					he departed for the village of Bālaka-loṇaka<br />
					where at the time <a id="pt155" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg155"><span class="f2">[155]</span></a> the reverend Bhagu was sojourning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the Lord coming some way off<br />
					Bhagu set out a seat<br />
					and got water for the feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, with due salutations,<br />
					Bhagu had sat down to one side,<br />
					the Lord, after asking him<br />
					whether all was going well with him<br />
					and after learning that all went well,<br />
					proceeded by homily to instruct,<br />
					inform,<br />
					enlighten<br />
					and hearten Bhagu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he rose up and departed to Pācīna-vaɱsa-dāya, where at the time<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha, Nandiya, and Kimbila were living.</p>

					<p class="f4">The forest-guard who, at a distance,<br />
					had seen the Lord coming,<br />
					said to the Lord:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't go in there,<br />
					recluse ... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.031.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 31,</a> down to)</i><br />
					... <a id="pt156" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg156"><span class="f2">[156-7]</span></a> to ask the three whether,<br />
					in leading such a life,<br />
					they reached any other state of pure well-being,<br />
					quite out of the ordinary<br />
					and beyond the scope of man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Leading a life that is strenuous,<br />
					ardent and purged of self,<br />
					we get, sir (in our Ecstasy exercises),<br />
					the aura <i>(obhāsa)</i><br />
					and the apperception <i>(dassana)</i> of Form;<br />
					but they soon fade away;<br />
					and we cannot get the mental reflex <i>(nimitta)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you must, said the. Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself too, in <a id="pg246"><span class="f2 g"><b>[246]</b></span></a> the days before Enlightenment,<br />
					when I was only a Bodhisatta<br />
					without full Enlightenment,<br />
					got the aura and the apperception of Form;<br />
					but they <a id="pt158" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg158"><span class="f2">[158]</span></a> soon faded away,<br />
					and I asked myself why they did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought I: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Doubts have arisen within me<br />
					and consequently mental concentration has passed away<br />
					and with it the aura and the apperception;<br />
					I will take measures<br />
					to stop such doubts from arising in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Leading the strenuous and ardent life<br />
					purged of self,<br />
					I recovered the phenomena;<br />
					but soon they left me again,<br />
					and, on asking myself why they left me,<br />
					I concluded that it was because<br />
					intellectual shortcomings had occurred<br />
					and consequently mental concentration had passed away<br />
					and the phenomena with it,<br />
					and that I must take measures<br />
					to stop such doubts and such intellectual shortcomings<br />
					from arising in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with (1) doubts and<br />
					(2) intellectual shortcomings,<br />
					so, successively and cumulatively,<br />
					I dealt with -<br />
					(3) flurry and worry,<br />
					(4) palsied fear, -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as palsy would arise<br />
					in a traveller on a long journey<br />
					if on either side murderers appeared,<br />
					so that palsy came on him<br />
					from right and from left, -<br />
					so did palsy arise within me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt159" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg159"><span class="f2">[159]</span></a> (5) elation, -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as elation would arise<br />
					in a man hunting for a buried hoard<br />
					if he came on five hoards all at once,<br />
					so did elation arise within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">(6) lewdness,<br />
					(7) excessive effort, -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man grasping a quail<br />
					with might and main in both hands<br />
					would kill the bird,<br />
					such was the excessive effort<br />
					which arose within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">(8) slackness <a id="pt160" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg160"><span class="f2">[160]</span></a>, -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a quail would slip from the hand<br />
					of a man who held it in a loose and slack grasp,<br />
					such was the slackness which arose within me.</p>

					<p class="f4">(9) aspirations, and<br />
					(10) multiplicity in sensory perception.

					(11) Leading a life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I got the aura and the apperception of Form,<br />
					but they soon faded away,<br />
					and I asked myself <a id="pg247"><span class="f2 g"><b>[247]</b></span></a> why they did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought I: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Meticulous analysis of the phenomena has arisen within me<br />
					and consequently concentration has passed away<br />
					and with it the aura and apperception;<br />
					I will take measures<br />
					to stop this meticulosity of analysis too<br />
					from occurring in future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing that each and every one<br />
					of these eleven things was a blemish,<br />
					I got rid of them all.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt161" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg161"><span class="f2">[161]</span></a> Continuing a life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I got the aura<br />
					but could not see Forms,<br />
					or I could see Forms<br />
					but did not get the aura,<br />
					during the whole of the night<br />
					or day<br />
					or both.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking it over, I concluded that,<br />
					when my mind was engaged<br />
					on the mental reflex of the one,<br />
					it neglected the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">Continuing the life that was strenuous<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					I succeeded in getting aura and apperception of Form,<br />
					now in a lesser degree<br />
					now in a boundless degree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking it over,<br />
					I concluded that this turned on<br />
					the degree of my mental concentration; -<br />
					when my mental concentration was less,<br />
					my eye was less,<br />
					and with that lesser eye<br />
					I could only discern a lesser aura and lesser Forms;<br />
					whereas, when my mental concentration was boundess,<br />
					boundless too was my discernment<br />
					of these things<br />
					by night<br />
					or day<br />
					or both.</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as <a id="pt162" href="../../pali/mn/mn.128.pali.bd.htm#pg162"><span class="f2">[162]</span></a> I had got rid of each and every one<br />
					of the foregoing eleven things<br />
					which I perceived to be blemishes,<br />
					then, realizing that they were all gone from me,<br />
					I resolved to develop mental concentration<br />
					along three lines: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I developed it with the accompaniment of observation and reflection;<br />
					I developed it with the accompaniment of observation<br />
					but not of reflection;<br />
					I developed it with the accompaniment of neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">I developed mental concentration<br />
					with zest<br />
					and without it;</p>

					<p class="f4">I developed mental concentration in association with a sense of satisfaction;</p>

					<p class="f4">I developed it in association with poised equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">As soon as I had developed mental concentration<br />
					in these several modes,<br />
					there arose in me<br />
					the knowledge and the vision<br />
					that my Deliverance was assured,<br />
					that this was my last exist- <a id="pg248"><span class="f2 g"><b>[248]</b></span></a> ence,<br />
					and that there was now no more<br />
					of what I had been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
