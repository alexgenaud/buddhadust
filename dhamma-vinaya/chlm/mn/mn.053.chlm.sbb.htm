					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a><br />
					in the Banyan pleasaunce,<br />
					the Sakyans of that city,<br />
					who had got a new hall,<br />
					never occupied so far by recluse<br />
					or brahmin<br />
					or any human being,<br />
					came to the Lord,<br />
					and, after salutations,<br />
					took their seats to one side,<br />
					telling him of their brand-new hall<br />
					and inviting him to use it first,<br />
					and then they would use it afterwards themselves;<br />
					if he would only consent,<br />
					that would long enure to their <a id="pt354" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg354"><span class="f2">[354]</span></a> weal and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">By silence the Lord consented;<br />
					and, on his consenting,<br />
					those Sakyans rose<br />
					and with deep obeisance<br />
					withdrew to complete preparing the hall for occupation, -<br />
					setting out seats,<br />
					planting tubs of water about,<br />
					and getting lamps and oil ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had finished,<br />
					they came and stood by him<br />
					to tell the Lord they awaited his pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord, with the Confraternity,<br />
					proceeded to the hall,<br />
					bathed his feet,<br />
					went in,<br />
					and took his seat by the centre-post<br />
					with his face towards the East.</p>

					<p class="f4">He was followed by the Confraternity<br />
					who, entering the hall after bathing their feet,<br />
					seated themselves by the western wall,<br />
					facing east<br />
					and with the Lord in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then came the Sakyans<br />
					who, entering the hall after bathing their feet,<br />
					seated themselves by the eastern wall,<br />
					facing west<br />
					and with the Lord in front of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Far into the night<br />
					the Lord by homily instructed,<br />
					informed,<br />
					helped onward,<br />
					and cheered forward<br />
					those Sakyans of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					till at last he said to Ãnanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell them, please,<br />
					about him who is in training to become an adept,<br />
					and the path he treads.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda assenting,<br />
					the Lord had his robe folded in four<br />
					and lay down on it on his <a id="pg255"><span class="f2 g"><b>[255]</b></span></a> right side<br />
					in the lion-posture,<br />
					foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					awaiting the moment appointed for his arising.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Addressing Mahānāma the Sakyan,<br />
					Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who is virtuous,<br />
					who keeps watch and ward over the portals of sense,<br />
					is temperate in eating,<br />
					vigilant,<br />
					established in the seven virtuous qualities,<br />
					and is able at will -<br />
					without difficulty or trouble -<br />
					to induce the Four Ecstasies<br />
					which transcend thought<br />
					and confer wellbeing here and now.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">How, Mahānāma, <a id="pt355" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg355"><span class="f2">[355]</span></a> does the disciple of the Noble become virtuous?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by following virtue's code,<br />
					by controlling himself<br />
					by the control of the public confession of transgressions,<br />
					by keeping to the plane of right behaviour,<br />
					by viewing even trifling offences as perilous,<br />
					and by embracing and training himself in the (ten) moral precepts.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he becomes virtuous.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">How, Mahānāma, does the disciple of the Noble<br />
					keep watch and ward over the portals of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by refusing,<br />
					when he sees with the eye a visible shape,<br />
					to be led away by its general appearance<br />
					or particular marks,<br />
					inasmuch as lack of control over sight<br />
					might let in appetites and frets,<br />
					with evil and wrong states of consciousness;<br />
					and therefore he schools himself<br />
					to keep the sense of sight under control<br />
					and under guard,<br />
					and develops his control of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he does the like with the five other senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he keeps watch and ward<br />
					over the portals of sense.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he temperate in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by taking his food duly and advisedly,<br />
					not for pleasure or delight,<br />
					nor for ostentation or display,<br />
					but only to the extent necessary<br />
					to support and sustain his physical frame,<br />
					in order to shield it from hurt<br />
					and to further the higher life,<br />
					resolving to put from him<br />
					the old feelings<br />
					and not to let any new feelings arise,<br />
					to the end that the blameless lot may be his<br />
					and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he is temperate in eating.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he vigilant?</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Chalmers here omits the last watch of the night which is practiced as is the day and the first watch.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Why, by purging his heart of <a id="pg256"><span class="f2 g"><b>[256]</b></span></a> besetting tendencies, -<br />
					whether by day<br />
					as he paces to and fro or sits down,<br />
					or during the first watch of the night<br />
					as he paces to and fro or sits down,<br />
					or during the middle watch of the night<br />
					as he lies couched lion-like<br />
					on his right side,<br />
					foot resting on foot,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					awaiting the moment appointed for his arising.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he <a id="pt356" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg356"><span class="f2">[356]</span></a> established in the seven virtuous qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why,<br />
					(i) by faith, by that faith in the Truth-finder's enlightenment whereby he avers that this is indeed the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment!</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) Shamefaced is he, -<br />
					inwardly ashamed of wrongful acts or words or thoughts,<br />
					inwardly ashamed of harbouring evil and wrong states of consciousness,</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) Sensitive is he to reproach from without, -<br />
					dreading reproach for wrongful acts or words or thoughts<br />
					or for harbouring evil and wrong states of consciousness,</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) Well-informed is he,<br />
					a repository and a treasury of all he hears;<br />
					all doctrines -<br />
					beginning aright,<br />
					proceeding aright,<br />
					and ending aright -<br />
					which in letter and in spirit<br />
					proclaim the higher life<br />
					in all its perfection and purity,<br />
					all these he learns and knows by heart;<br />
					his lips repeat them;<br />
					his mind examines them;<br />
					his gaze penetrates them through and through,</p>

					<p class="f4">(v) Strenuous is he<br />
					to put away wrong states of consciousness<br />
					and to develop such states as are right, -<br />
					always striving,<br />
					always sturdy in endeavour,<br />
					always resolute in states of consciousness which are right.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vi) Retentive of memory is he,<br />
					with a richly stored memory<br />
					that recollects and recalls<br />
					both the doings and the sayings of long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">(vii) Lore is his,<br />
					the lore which embraces life's ebb and flow,<br />
					the noble, penetrating lore<br />
					which leads on to the utter cessation of all Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he is established in the seven virtuous qualities.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is he able at will<br />
					to induce the Four Ecstasies?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, by divesting himself of pleasures of sense,<br />
					by divesting himself of wrong states of con- <a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> sciousness,<br />
					so that he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection;</p>

					<p class="f4">by rising above observation and reflection,<br />
					so that he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration -<br />
					above all observation and reflection -<br />
					whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so on to the Third and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the disciple of the Noble<br />
					is able at will -<br />
					without difficulty or trouble -<br />
					to induce the Four Ecstasies<br />
					which transcend thought and confer well-being here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disciple of the Noble<br />
					who has achieved this much<br />
					<a id="pt357" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg357"><span class="f2">[357]</span></a> is said to be in training to become an adept<br />
					whose development is assured,<br />
					who is able to win forth,<br />
					able to reach enlightenment,<br />
					able to attain to the peace beyond compare.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a hen<br />
					with a clutch of eight,<br />
					ten,<br />
					or a dozen eggs,<br />
					on which she sits closely<br />
					to keep them warm<br />
					and hatch them out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even though no wish arises within her<br />
					that her chicks<br />
					with beak or claw<br />
					may break through the shell<br />
					and come out all right,<br />
					yet they are quite able to break through their shells<br />
					and win forth all right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so the disciple of the Noble<br />
					who has achieved ...<br />
					peace beyond compare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having won that perfection of poise and mindfulness<br />
					(which the Fourth Ecstasy brings),<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					calls to mind his previous existences -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>) ...<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first way in which,<br />
					like the chick from the shell,<br />
					he wins forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having won that perfection of poise and mindfulness<br />
					(which the Fourth Ecstasy brings),<br />
					the disciple of the Noble,<br />
					with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					and re-appearing elsewhere ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>) ...<br />
					in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second way in which,<br />
					like the chick from the shell,<br />
					he wins forth.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg258"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span></a> Having won that perfection of poise and mindfulness<br />
					(which the Fourth Ecstasy brings),<br />
					the disciple of the Noble,<br />
					by eradicating the Cankers,<br />
					comes to the Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					in which no Cankers are;<br />
					here and now he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					a Deliverance which of and by himself<br />
					he has discerned and realized.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt358" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg358"><span class="f2">358</span></a> This is the third way in which,<br />
					like the chick from the shell,<br />
					he wins forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">His conduct shows<br />
					that the disciple of the Noble is virtuous,<br />
					keeps watch and ward over the portals of sense,<br />
					is temperate in eating,<br />
					is vigilant,<br />
					is established in the seven virtuous qualities,<br />
					and is able at will -<br />
					without difficulty or trouble -<br />
					to induce the Four Ecstasies<br />
					which transcend thought<br />
					and confer wellbeing here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">His lore shows<br />
					that the disciple of the Noble<br />
					can recall to mind his own previous existences,<br />
					can read with the Eye Celestial<br />
					the future destinies of beings<br />
					in act to pass hence<br />
					and re-appear elsewhere,<br />
					and has won for himself<br />
					Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					by eradicating the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple of the Noble<br />
					who has achieved all this<br />
					is said to be endowed with lore,<br />
					with conduct,<br />
					and with the conduct that flows from lore.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was a Brahma named the Ever-young<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who was the author of these lines -</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>With such as prize descent, the Nobleman<br />
							stands first; first place 'mong gods and men is his<br />
							who walks in virtue and excels in lore.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now these lines, Mahānāma,<br />
					were rightly and not wrongly sung and uttered<br />
					by that Brahma the Ever-young;<br />
					full of meaning<br />
					and not empty are they;<br />
					and the Lord has approved them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, the Lord rose<br />
					and commended what Ānanda <a id="pg259"><span class="f2 g"><b>[259]</b></span></a> had told these Sakyans of Kapilavatthu concerning training.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt359" href="../../pali/mn/mn.053.pali.bd.htm#pg359"><span class="f2">[359]</span></a> Thus spoke the reverend Ānanda with the Master's approval.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Sakyans of Kapilavatthu rejoiced in what Ānanda had said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The preamble of this Sutta occurs also verbatim at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.35.202.pali.bd.htm">Samyutta IV, 182,</a> - ending before Ãnanda's lecture to the Sakyans, and continuing instead with an address to the Almsmen by Moggallāna.</p>
