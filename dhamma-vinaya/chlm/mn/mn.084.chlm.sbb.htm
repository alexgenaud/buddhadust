					<p class="f4">Once when the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna was staying at Madhura in the Gundā grove,<br />
					it reached the ears of Avanti-putta, King of Madhura,<br />
					that there was staying in that grove the recluse Kaccāna,<br />
					whose reputation stood high in general report<br />
					as being a learned and wise sage<br />
					of much lore,<br />
					a brilliant speaker and debater,<br />
					an aged man<br />
					and a saint (arahā) such as it was good to go and see.</p>

					<p class="f4">So King Avantiputta,<br />
					having commanded his chariots<br />
					so fair, so fair,<br />
					to be made ready,<br />
					got into one of them<br />
					and drove forth from Madhura in royal state<br />
					with his princely train<br />
					to see the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Driving as far as a chariot could go,<br />
					and then proceeding on foot,<br />
					the king came at last to Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					<a id="pt84" href="../../pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg84"><span class="f2">[84]</span></a> with whom he exchanged courteous greetings<br />
					before seating himself to one side<br />
					and saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Brahmins maintain, Kaccāna,<br />
					that they alone form the superior class,<br />
					all other classes being inferior;<br />
					that brahmins alone form the white class,<br />
					all other classes being black;<br />
					that purity resides in brahmins alone<br />
					and not in non-brahmins;<br />
					and that brahmins are Brahmā's only legitimate sons,<br />
					born from his mouth,<br />
					offspring of his,<br />
					creations of his,<br />
					and his heirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you say to that?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is an empty assertion, sire,<br />
					as may be shown as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble grows rich and wealthy,<br />
					can he have as his servant<br />
					another noble -<br />
					or a brahmin,<br />
					or a middle-class man,<br />
					or a peasant -<br />
					to get up early,<br />
					to go late to bed,<br />
					to minister assiduously<br />
					and to study his master in word and deed?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if, sire,<br />
					it were a brahmin who had thriven,<br />
					could he likewise have as his servant<br />
					a brahmin,<br />
					a middle-class man,<br />
					a peasant,<br />
					or <a id="pt85" href="../../pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg85"><span class="f2">[85]</span></a> a noble?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> And if it were either a middle-class man<br />
					or a peasant who had thriven,<br />
					could he likewise have as his servant<br />
					someone from any of the three other classes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this be so, sire,<br />
					do you think all four classes<br />
					are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly,<br />
					if this be so,<br />
					all four classes are on precisely the same footing,<br />
					and I see no difference at all between them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The emptiness of the brahmin claim to superiority<br />
					can also be shown in the following way: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble kills,<br />
					robs,<br />
					fornicates,<br />
					lies,<br />
					slanders,<br />
					is bitter of tongue,<br />
					tattles,<br />
					covets,<br />
					harbours ill-will,<br />
					and has a wrong outlook, -<br />
					will he, after death at the body's dissolution<br />
					pass to a state of misery and woe<br />
					or to purgatory?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or will he not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a noble will pass<br />
					to a doom of misery and woe or to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my view,<br />
					and this is what I have heard from saintly men (arahataɱ).</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right;<br />
					your view is right<br />
					and you have been told aright by saintly men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, would the like doom<br />
					await a brahmin,<br />
					or middle-class man,<br />
					or peasant of like disposition?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it would.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if this be so, sire,<br />
					do you think all four classes<br />
					are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt87" href="../../pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg87"><span class="f2">[87]</span></a>	Undoubtedly, if this be so,<br />
					all four classes are on precisely the same footing,<br />
					and I see no difference between them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another way to demonstrate<br />
					the emptiness of the brahmin claim<br />
					is as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble abstains from killing and robbing and so forth,<br />
					will he at death<br />
					pass to bliss in heaven,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4">At death he will pass to bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my view,<br />
					and this is what I have heard from saintly men.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">And would the same apply<br />
					to a brahmin<br />
					or to a middle-class man<br />
					or to a peasant?</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> Yes, it would.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if these be so, sire,<br />
					do you think all four classes<br />
					are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt88" href="../../pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg88"><span class="f2">[88]</span></a>	Undoubtedly, if this be so,<br />
					all four classes are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					and I see no difference between them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The emptiness of the brahmin claim<br />
					can further be demonstrated as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble is a burglar,<br />
					thief,<br />
					housebreaker,<br />
					footpad or adulterer,<br />
					and if your people catch him<br />
					and haul the malefactor before you for sentence,<br />
					what would you do to him?</p>

					<p class="f4">I should put him to death<br />
					or confiscate his goods<br />
					or banish him<br />
					or otherwise deal with him<br />
					as circumstances required.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the noble is now merged in the malefactor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the same apply to a malefactor<br />
					from any of the three other classes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it would.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this be so, sire,<br />
					are all four classes on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly, if this be so,<br />
					all four classes are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					and I see no difference between them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The emptiness of the brahmin claim<br />
					is also apparent from the following: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robe,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					abstaining from killing and stealing and lying,<br />
					eating but one meal a day,<br />
					and living the higher life<br />
					in virtue and goodness, -<br />
					what would you do to him?</p>

					<p class="f4">I would salute him,<br />
					or rise to meet him,<br />
					or invite him to be seated,<br />
					or would ask him to accept robes,<br />
					alms,<br />
					bedding and medicines,<br />
					or would extend to him the defence,<br />
					protection<br />
					and safeguards<br />
					which are his due.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, the noble is now merged in the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the same reception be extended<br />
					to Pilgrims from the three other classes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it would.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> If this be so, sire,<br />
					are all four classes on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Undoubtedly, if this be so,<br />
					all four classes are on precisely the same footing herein,<br />
					and I see no difference between them.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt90" href="../../pali/mn/mn.084.pali.bd.htm#pg90"><span class="f2">[90]</span></a>	Hereupon, Avanti-putta, King of Madhura,<br />
					said to the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so,<br />
					in many a figure,<br />
					has Kaccāna expounded the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him I come as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity,<br />
					asking him to accept as his follower<br />
					me who have found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this time forth while life shall last.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come not to me, sire,<br />
					as your refuge!</p>

					<p class="f4">Find your refuge,<br />
					as I have found mine,<br />
					in none but the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where is the present abode of that Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened?</p>

					<p class="f4">He has passed away.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I could but hear him<br />
					within a distance of ten leagues from here,<br />
					ten leagues would I travel to visit him;<br />
					yes, I would travel,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty,<br />
					forty,<br />
					fifty,<br />
					or a hundred leagues to visit that Lord,<br />
					the arahat all enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, since he has passed away,<br />
					to him,<br />
					even though he have passed away,<br />
					do I come as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask Kaccāna to accept as (the Lord's) follower<br />
					me who have found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this time forth while life shall last.</p>
