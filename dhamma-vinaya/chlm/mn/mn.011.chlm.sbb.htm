					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Lord Chalmers has got this completely wrong. It's: 'We have these, empty are other systems'. See the other translations.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">We have in our very midst a recluse,<br />
					yes and a second,<br />
					third,<br />
					and fourth recluse<br />
					who are empty and heretical -<br />
					no true recluses! -<br />
					in these words<br />
					let your indictment ring out<br />
					like a lion's roar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If now it happens that Wanderers <i>(paribbājakā)</i> of other sects than yours<br />
					ask you by what inspiration<br />
					and on what authority you say this,<br />
					then your answer to such should be this:</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto us, reverend sirs,<br />
					the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has revealed four states of mind<br />
					which we have realized<br />
					and therefore speak thus;<br />
					and those four states of mind are that we<br />
					(i) believe in our Teacher,<br />
					(ii) believe in his Doctrine,<br />
					(iii) have fulfilled the code of virtue, and<br />
					(iv) love all our dear fellow-believers,<br />
					be they lay or be they Pilgrims.</p>

					<p class="f4">These four states we have realized,<br />
					and that is why we speak thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">If now the Wanderers of other sects<br />
					were to rejoin that,<br />
					in like manner,<br />
					they believed in a teacher of their own<br />
					and in his doctrine,<br />
					had fulfilled their own code of virtue,<br />
					and loved their own dear fellow-believers;<br />
					and if they went on to ask you<br />
					what was the distinction<br />
					or divergence<br />
					or difference<br />
					between them and you; -<br />
					then, you should ask them<br />
					whether the Goal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was one or many.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they answer aright,<br />
					they will say<br />
					the Goal <a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> is one and not many.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it, you will ask,<br />
					the Goal of the man with,<br />
					or of the man without, passion - hate - illusion?</p>

					<p class="f4">If they answer aright,<br />
					they will say it is the Goal of the man without passion, hate, or illusion, -<br />
					as they will also say,<br />
					in answer to your further questions,<br />
					that it is the Goal of the man without cravings,<br />
					without attachments,<br />
					of the man who is without fractiousness<br />
					and without a combative spirit,<br />
					and who is free from obsessions.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are the two speculative ideas, -<br />
					of eternalism<br />
					and of annihilationism.</p>

					<p class="f4">Every recluse or brahmin who is attached,<br />
					devoted,<br />
					and given over to the first view<br />
					is an opponent of the other;<br />
					and vice versa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recluses or brahmins<br />
					who know not the real nature<br />
					of the rise and wane of these two speculative ideas,<br />
					who know not their lure,<br />
					their perils,<br />
					and their outcome, -<br />
					harbour passion,<br />
					hate,<br />
					illusion,<br />
					cravings<br />
					and attachments,<br />
					are empty of lore,<br />
					are foes to peace,<br />
					take pleasure and delight in obsessions,<br />
					nor do they win deliverance from birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					depression of body and mind,<br />
					or from tribulation; -<br />
					they win, say I,<br />
					no deliverance from Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whereas, all recluses and brahmins<br />
					who do know the real nature<br />
					of the rise and wane of these two speculative ideas,<br />
					their lure,<br />
					perils<br />
					and outcome, -<br />
					are void of passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and illusion,<br />
					void of cravings<br />
					and attachments,<br />
					are rich in lore,<br />
					combat not the unpeaceful,<br />
					take no pleasure or delight in obsessions,<br />
					and win Deliverance from birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					depression of body and mind,<br />
					and from tribulation; -<br />
					these win, say I,<br />
					Deliverance from Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four attachments, -<br />
					to sensuous pleasure,<br />
					to speculative ideas,<br />
					to works,<br />
					and to soul-theories.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some recluses and brahmins profess to understand them all,<br />
					but fail to show understanding of the whole set of four;<br />
					for example,<br />
					they show an <a id="pg44"><span class="f2 g"><b>[44]</b></span></a> understanding of attachment to sensuous pleasures,<br />
					but not of the other attachments.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because these good people do not understand aright what the others are.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a creed and rule as theirs,<br />
					it is clear their belief in their teacher is not perfect,<br />
					or their belief in his plan,<br />
					or fulfilment of the code of virtue,<br />
					or love for their fellow-believers.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this must be so in any creed and rule<br />
					which has been wrongly revealed<br />
					and wrongly preached,<br />
					which does not bring salvation and peace,<br />
					which has not been preached by the All-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					not only professes to understand all attachments<br />
					but also communicates to others<br />
					his understanding of all four.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a creed and rule as ours, Almsmen,<br />
					it is clear that belief in the Master is perfect,<br />
					as belief in his Doctrine is perfect,<br />
					and as fulfilment of the code of virtue<br />
					and love for fellow-believers are perfect.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this must be so in a creed and rule<br />
					which has been rightly revealed<br />
					and rightly preached,<br />
					which brings salvation and peace,<br />
					which has been preached by the All-Enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whence come the four attachments?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is their origin?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is their parentage?</p>

					<p class="f4">How are they produced?</p>

					<p class="f4">They come from craving;<br />
					they originate in craving;<br />
					they are born of craving;<br />
					and by craving they are produced.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving in its turn<br />
					comes from feeling;<br />
					it originates in feeling;<br />
					it is born of feeling;<br />
					and by feeling it is produced.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, feeling comes from contact,<br />
					contact from the six spheres of sense,<br />
					these six spheres from name-and-shape,<br />
					name-and-shape from perception,<br />
					perception from plastic forces, [Ed.: <a href="../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sankhara.htm"><i>saŋkhārā</i></a>]<br />
					plastic forces from ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">When ignorance has passed away<br />
					and when knowledge (of the true goal) has arisen in an Almsman,<br />
					then, with this purging of ignorance<br />
					and the uprising of knowledge,<br />
					he attaches himself no longer to sensuous pleasure,<br />
					or to speculative ideas,<br />
					or to works,<br />
					or to soul-theories;<br />
					being void of attachment,<br />
					he trembles not;<br />
					trembling not,<br />
					he wins Nirvana for himself, -<br />
					sure in his convic- <a id="pg45"><span class="f2 g"><b>[45]</b></span></a> tion<br />
					that for him rebirth is no more,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done,<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					what he was is no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Niṭṭhā.</i> <i>Bu.</i>  observes that, while all alike professed 'Arahat-ship' as their goal, brahmins aimed at the <i>brahmaloka, tapas</i> ascetics at the <i>ābhassara</i> heaven, <i>paribbājakas</i> at the <i>subhakiṇṇa</i> heaven, the <i>ājīvikas</i> at the heaven of Infinity of mind. Really, they all wanted some (unconscious) <i>future</i> (cf. <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.01.pali.bd.htm#p68">Dīgha I, 28,</a> and <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.01.rhyt.pts.htm#fn171"><i>Dialogues</i> I, 41, n. 2</a>), whereas in Buddhism the goal is Arahatship pure and simple, with no after-life.</p>
