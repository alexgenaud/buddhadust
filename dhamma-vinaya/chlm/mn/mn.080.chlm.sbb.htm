					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's grove<br />
					in Anāthapiṇḍica's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Wanderer Vekhanassa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came to the Lord<br />
					and after an exchange of courteous greetings took <a id="pg22"><span class="f2 g"><b>[22]</b></span></a> his stand to one side,<br />
					exclaiming with deep emotion:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here is perfection!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">here is perfection!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why do you say this?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is this perfection?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The perfection than which<br />
					nothing is higher or more excellent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the perfection<br />
					than which nothing is higher or more excellent?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is the perfection than which<br />
					nothing is higher or more excellent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This argument of yours, Kaccāna,<br />
					would be protracted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You affirm perfection<br />
					but never define it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt41" href="../../pali/mn/mn.080.pali.bd.htm#pg41"><span class="f2">[41-42]</span></a> It is just as if a man were to say<br />
					his longing and his heart's desire<br />
					was for the belle of the land<br />
					but were to confess,<br />
					on being questioned,<br />
					that he did not know<br />
					what rank she belonged to;<br />
					or what her name was;<br />
					or what family she belonged to;<br />
					or whether she was tall,<br />
					short,<br />
					or middle-sized;<br />
					or whether she was black or brown or dusky;<br />
					or what village or township or city she belonged to; - and,<br />
					finally,<br />
					that he did not know her nor had ever seen her.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In such a case,<br />
					does not the man's statement prove unhelpful?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Certainly, sir,<br />
					it would be, -<br />
					in such a case.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way you affirm perfection but never define it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even, sir, as a gem -<br />
					bright and of the purest water,<br />
					with eight facets,<br />
					excellently cut,<br />
					and strung on a yellow thread<br />
					- shines and glitters and sparkles,<br />
					with the like perfection<br />
					shows the hale Self after death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which think you shines and sparkles the most, -<br />
					your gem or the fire-fly of the night?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fire-fly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a lamp compare?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And a conflagration in the night?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the morning stars,<br />
					at dawn in a cloudless sky?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the full moon<br />
					in a clear sky at midnight?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the sun at his zenith<br />
					at the end of the rains?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Further, it is within my personal cognizance,<br />
					Udāyi,<br />
					that many, very many, deities<br />
					are so luminous in themselves<br />
					that they draw no light from sun or moon.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet I do not speak of a perfection<br />
					than which nothing is higher or more excellent,<br />
					whereas you declare your perfection to be less than,<br />
					and inferior to,<br />
					a fire-fly,<br />
					but never define it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five strands, Kaccāna,<br />
					make up pleasures of sense,<br />
					namely,<br />
					visible shapes,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes and touch,<br />
					<a id="pt43" href="../../pali/mn/mn.080.pali.bd.htm#pg43"><span class="f2">[43]</span></a> all of them pleasant and agreeable and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with pleasure and exciting.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The pleasure and satisfaction which they start<br />
					is called sensuous pleasure,<br />
					built up from the foregoing five,<br />
					and culminating in that refinement of pleasure<br />
					which is accounted the highest of all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here Vekhanassa said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sir,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					how well put is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your observation that pleasures of sense<br />
					build up sensuous pleasure,<br />
					culminating in that refinement of pleasure<br />
					which is accounted the highest of all!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All this is hard for you to grasp, Kaccāna, -<br />
					you who hold different views<br />
					and a different creed,<br />
					who have a different objective,<br />
					a different allegiance<br />
					and a different teaching.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But it would be known to those Almsmen<br />
					who are Arahats,<br />
					in whom Cankers are dead,<br />
					who have greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have cast off their burthen,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					whose bonds are broken,<br />
					who by utter Knowledge have won Deliverance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here, in his annoyance and rage,<br />
					the Wanderer Vekhanassa, actually daring<br />
					to flout and scoff at the Lord to his face,<br />
					said to the Lord,<br />
					with the idea that<br />
					'the recluse Gotama' would be annoyed: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So this is how some 'recluses and brahmins,'<br />
					knowing naught of what has been before<br />
					and seeing nothing of what shall <a id="pg23"><span class="f2 g"><b>[23]</b></span></a> come hereafter,<br />
					yet profess:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is now no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is now no more<br />
					of what I have been!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These professions of theirs<br />
					prove ridiculous,<br />
					mere words,<br />
					empty and without substance!</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt44" href="../../pali/mn/mn.080.pali.bd.htm#pg44"><span class="f2">[44]</span></a>	Your censure is quite just,<br />
					Kaccāna,<br />
					with regard to such recluses and brahmins<br />
					as, knowing naught of what has been before<br />
					and seeing nothing of what shall come hereafter,<br />
					yet profess all this.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But let us leave what has been<br />
					and what will be hereafter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let there come along a man of intelligence,<br />
					guileless,<br />
					honest and straightforward,<br />
					who avers that he has a message to deliver<br />
					and a Doctrine to preach,<br />
					and that any man who walks according to that message<br />
					will not be long ere of himself he will know<br />
					and of himself will see;<br />
					for thereby comes release from the direst of bonds -<br />
					namely ignorance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a tiny babe<br />
					which cannot yet sit up<br />
					and has fivefold swaddlings round its neck<br />
					and is all bandages.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, as he grows<br />
					and develops his faculties,<br />
					those bandages are taken off,<br />
					he would know that he was released<br />
					and that his bandages were gone.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just the same<br />
					when a man of intelligence comes along,<br />
					guileless,<br />
					honest and straightforward,<br />
					who avers that he has a message to deliver<br />
					and a Doctrine to preach,<br />
					and that any man who walks according to that message<br />
					will not be long ere of himself he will know<br />
					and of himself will see;<br />
					for thereby comes release from the direst of bonds -<br />
					namely ignorance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the Wanderer Vekhanassa said to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.</p>
