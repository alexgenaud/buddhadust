					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">In general, peoples wishes and desires and aims<br />
					are for a decrease in what is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant,<br />
					and for an increase in what is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">In people with such aims<br />
					that which is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant<br />
					waxes apace,<br />
					while that which is desirable,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and pleasant<br />
					wanes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you take to be the cause of this?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord is the root<br />
					and the guide<br />
					and the basis<br />
					of all our ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">We beg that the Lord may be moved<br />
					to expound the meaning of his utterance,<br />
					so that we may treasure up<br />
					what we hear from him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then listen<br />
					and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					who then went on to address the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed everyday man,<br />
					who takes no count of the Noble<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in Noble doctrine;<br />
					who takes no count of the Excellent<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in Excellent doctrine; -<br />
					such a one does not know what to cultivate<br />
					and what not to cultivate;<br />
					he does not know what to foster<br />
					and what not to foster;<br />
					he cultivates and fosters<br />
					what he should not,<br />
					and fails to cultivate and foster<br />
					what he ought to cultivate and foster, -<br />
					with the result that,<br />
					within him,<br />
					that which is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant waxes apace,<br />
					while that which is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant <a id="pg223"><span class="f2 g"><b>[223]</b></span></a> wanes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends not.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now an instructed disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who does take count of the Noble<br />
					and is trained and versed in Noble doctrine,<br />
					who does take count of the Excellent<br />
					and is trained and versed in Excellent doctrine; -<br />
					such a one knows what to cultivate<br />
					and what not to cultivate;<br />
					he knows what to foster<br />
					and what not to foster;<br />
					and so he does not cultivate and foster<br />
					what he should not,<br />
					but cultivates and fosters<br />
					what he ought to cultivate and foster, -<br />
					with the result that, within him,<br />
					that which is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant<br />
					wanes,<br />
					while that which is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant<br />
					waxes apace.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four ways of professing a Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and also ripens to pain thereafter;<br />
					the second is pleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to pain thereafter;<br />
					the third is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter;<br />
					and the fourth both is pleasant for the time being<br />
					and also ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first case, a man knows it not,<br />
					has no knowledge of it,<br />
					and fails to discern its real nature<br />
					as unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripening to pain thereafter;<br />
					he cultivates it,<br />
					and does not shun it.</p>

					<p class="f4">The result is that what is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant<br />
					waxes apace,<br />
					while what is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant<br />
					wanes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends not.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[And the like is the case too with regard to the second profession, where what is pleasant for the time being ripens to pain thereafter.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends not.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the third case,<br />
					the man knows it not,<br />
					has no knowledge of it,<br />
					and fails to discern its real nature as unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripening to be pleasant thereafter;<br />
					he does not cultivate it<br />
					but shuns it.<br />
					The result is that what is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and <a id="pg224"><span class="f2 g"><b>[224]</b></span></a> unpleasant<br />
					waxes apace,<br />
					while what is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />

					<p class="f4"><i>[And the like happens with regard to the fourth profession, where what is pleasant for the time being also ripens to be pleasant thereafter.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends not.</p>

					<p class="f4">To return to the first profession.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man knows it,<br />
					has knowledge of it,<br />
					and discerns its real nature<br />
					as being unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripening to pain thereafter;<br />
					and if he accordingly does not cultivate it<br />
					but shuns it; -<br />
					the result is that what is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant<br />
					waxes apace,<br />
					while what is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant<br />
					wanes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[And the foregoing is the case too with regard to the second profession, where what is pleasant for the time being ripens to pain thereafter.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends.</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards the third profession,<br />
					if a man knows it,<br />
					has knowledge of it,<br />
					and discerns its real nature<br />
					as being unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripening to be pleasant thereafter;<br />
					and if he cultivates it<br />
					and does not shun it; -<br />
					the result is that what is desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and pleasant<br />
					waxes apace,<br />
					while what is undesirable,<br />
					disagreeable,<br />
					and unpleasant<br />
					wanes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[And the foregoing is the case too with regard to the fourth profession, where what is pleasant for the time being also ripens to be pleasant thereafter.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is what happens<br />
					to one who comprehends.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the nature of the first profession?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man who,<br />
					to the accompaniment of pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind,<br />
					slays, and,<br />
					as a consequence of slaying,<br />
					experiences pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind;<br />
					or who steals -<br />
					or fornicates -<br />
					or lies -<br />
					or slanders -<br />
					or reviles -<br />
					or tattles -<br />
					or covets -<br />
					or is <a id="pg225"><span class="f2 g"><b>[225]</b></span></a> malignant of heart -<br />
					or who, to the accompaniment of pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind,<br />
					has a wrong outlook,<br />
					and, as a consequence of his wrong outlook,<br />
					experiences pain<br />
					alike of body and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man, after death at the body's dissolution,<br />
					passes to a state of woe and misery<br />
					or to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is what is called<br />
					the profession of the Doctrine<br />
					which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripens to pain thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the nature of the second profession?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man who,<br />
					to the accompaniment of pleasure<br />
					alike of body and of mind,<br />
					slays,<br />
					and, as a consequence of his slaughter,<br />
					experiences pleasure<br />
					alike of body and mind;<br />
					or who steals ...<br />
					(etc., as in the preceding paragraph) ...<br />
					purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is what is called<br />
					the profession of the Doctrine<br />
					where what is pleasant for the time being<br />
					ripens to pain thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the nature of the third profession?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who,<br />
					to the accompaniment of pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind,<br />
					refrains from slaying<br />
					and, as a result of his abstinence,<br />
					experiences pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind;<br />
					or who refrains from stealing ... <br />
					or who, to the accompaniment of pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind,<br />
					gets a right outlook,<br />
					and, as a consequence of that right outlook,<br />
					experiences pain<br />
					alike of body and of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man, after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution,<br />
					passes to a happy state<br />
					or to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is what is called<br />
					the profession of the Doctrine<br />
					which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the nature of the fourth profession?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man who,<br />
					to the accompaniment of pleasure of body and of mind,<br />
					refrains from slaying ...<br />
					(etc., as in the preceding paragraph) ...<br />
					a happy state<br />
					or to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is what is called<br />
					the profession of the Doctrine<br />
					which is both pleasant for the time being<br />
					and also ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Almsmen, are the four ways of professing the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a bitter gourd<br />
					with poison <a id="pg226"><span class="f2 g"><b>[226]</b></span></a> in it,<br />
					and a man came along who wanted to live<br />
					and not to die,<br />
					who wanted to be comfortable<br />
					and disliked pain;<br />
					and if people were to say to him: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There is poison in this bitter gourd, my good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drink it if you will;<br />
					but, in drinking it,<br />
					you won't like its colour and odour and taste,<br />
					and, when you have drunk it,<br />
					you will come by your death<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that heedlessly he drank it<br />
					and did not turn away from it,<br />
					disliking its colour, odour, and taste<br />
					while he was drinking it,<br />
					and coming by his death<br />
					or deadly pain<br />
					when he had drunk it down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto this do I liken the first profession,<br />
					which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripens to pain thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is just as if there were a goblet of liquor,<br />
					all right in colour, odour, and taste,<br />
					but with poison in it,<br />
					and a man should come along<br />
					who wanted to live<br />
					and not to die,<br />
					who wanted to be comfortable<br />
					and disliked pain;<br />
					and if people were to say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This goblet of liquor<br />
					is all right in colour, odour, and taste,<br />
					but has poison in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drink it if you will ...<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that heedlessly he drank it<br />
					and did not turn away from it,<br />
					liking its colour, odour, and taste<br />
					while he was drinking it,<br />
					but coming by his death<br />
					or deadly pain<br />
					when he had drunk it down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto this do I liken the second profession,<br />
					which is pleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to pain thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, it is just as if there were decomposing urine<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					with divers medicaments in it,<br />
					and a man with jaundice<br />
					should come along;<br />
					and if people were to say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is decomposing urine<br />
					with divers medicaments in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drink it if you will;<br />
					but, in drinking it,<br />
					you won't like its colour or odour or taste,<br />
					but, when you have drunk it,<br />
					you will get well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that,<br />
					heedfully and without turning away from it,<br />
					he were to drink it,<br />
					disliking its colour and odour and taste<br />
					while he was drinking it,<br />
					but getting well after he <a id="pg227"><span class="f2 g"><b>[227]</b></span></a> had drunk it down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto this do I liken the third profession,<br />
					which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, it is just as if there were a mixture of curds and honey and ghee,<br />
					and a man with dysentery should come along,<br />
					and people were to say to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is a mixture of curds and honey and ghee.</p>

					<p class="f4">Drink it if you will;<br />
					and, in drinking it,<br />
					you will like its colour and odour and taste,<br />
					and, when you have drunk it,<br />
					you will get well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto this do I liken the fourth profession,<br />
					which both is pleasant for the time being<br />
					and also ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as, at harvest time<br />
					at the close of the rainy season,<br />
					the sun shines forth<br />
					and blazes in full glory,<br />
					scattering and putting to flight<br />
					the clouds of the air<br />
					as he rises high in the heavens<br />
					and drives before him<br />
					all murk and gloom from the skies, -<br />
					even so, Almsmen, does this last profession of the Doctrine,<br />
					which blesses both the present and the future,<br />
					shine forth<br />
					and blaze in full glory<br />
					as it overpowers the wrangles<br />
					of the warring hosts of recluses and brahmins.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
