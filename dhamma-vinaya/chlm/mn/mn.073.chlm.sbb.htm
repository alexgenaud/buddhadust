<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 73.  Vacchagotta is given a lesson in brief concerning what is skillful and what is not skillful and becomes a bhikkhu. Having mastered what is necessary as a foundation he is told to master calm and insight in order to attain magic powers, recollection of past lives, knowledge of the outcome of deeds, and the destruction of the Asavas. He masters all this and becomes an Arahant." />

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p><i>Kusalākusalaɱ.</i> <i>Kusala:</i> <i>PED</i>: "clever, skilful, expert; good, right, meritorious." Most frequently 'skillful'. The translation of <i>"Kusalākusalaɱ"</i> should make use of one root term so that the image created is of going in one direction and not going in that direction: "skillful and not-skillful", rather than going in one direction or it's opposite: "right and wrong". A thing that is not <i>kusala</i> may not be 'wrong'; but can just be less than optimal.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">I should like him briefly<br />
					to expound right and wrong to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I could expound them either in brief or at large, Vaccha,<br />
					but will confine myself here<br />
					to an exposition in brief.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Wanderer the Lord began:</p>

					<p class="f4">Greed is wrong;<br />
					freedom from greed is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred is wrong;<br />
					not to hate is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delusion is wrong;<br />
					to be free from delusion is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one triad is wrong,<br />
					the other right.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">To take life is wrong;<br />
					to refrain from taking life is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft is wrong;<br />
					to shun theft is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Indulgence in pleasures of sense is wrong;<br />
					to refrain from such indulgence is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lying is wrong;<br />
					to refrain from lies is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Slander <a id="pt490" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg490"><span class="f2">[490]</span></a> is wrong;<br />
					to refrain from slandering is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling is wrong;<br />
					not to revile is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Idle chatter is wrong;<br />
					to refrain therefrom is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">To covet is wrong;<br />
					not to covet is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">To be malevolent is wrong;<br />
					not to be male-völent is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Erroneous views are wrong;<br />
					sound views are right.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one set of ten is right,<br />
					the other set is wrong.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">So soon as Craving is eliminated -<br />
					grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					leaving only the bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree towered,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more -<br />
					then that Almsman becomes an Arahat,<br />
					in whom the Cankers are dead,<br />
					who has greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who has shed his burthen,<br />
					who has won his weal,<br />
					whose bonds to <a id="pg346"><span class="f2 g"><b>[346]</b></span></a> life are no more,<br />
					who by utter Knowledge<br />
					has won Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apart from the reverend Gotama, -<br />
					is there a single Almsman in his following<br />
					who has entered on<br />
					and dwells here and now<br />
					in that Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which is without Cankers<br />
					because Cankers are eradicated,<br />
					a Deliverance which of and by himself<br />
					he has apprehended and realized?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a mere hundred of my followers,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred,<br />
					but many more than that have achieved this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apart from the reverend Gotama<br />
					and the Almsmen, -<br />
					is there a single Almswoman in his following<br />
					who has achieved this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a mere hundred of my women followers,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred of them,<br />
					but many more than that have achieved this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apart from the reverend Gotama<br />
					and the Almsmen<br />
					and the Almswomen, -<br />
					is there a single white-robed layman<br />
					of his following in the higher life<br />
					who, by destruction of the Five Fetters<br />
					that bind people to this world,<br />
					has been translated to higher realms,<br />
					never to revert thence to this world?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a mere hundred of my laymen,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred of them,<br />
					but many more than that have <a id="pt491" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg491"><span class="f2">[491]</span></a> achieved this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apart from the reverend Gotama<br />
					and the Almsmen<br />
					and the Almswomen<br />
					and the laymen of the higher life, -<br />
					is there a single layman<br />
					who, though not denying himself pleasures of sense,<br />
					conforms and practises what he is taught,<br />
					without any doubtings or searchings of heart,<br />
					and in absolute confidence<br />
					and personal conviction<br />
					lives by his Master's teaching?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a mere hundred such laymen,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred Of them,<br />
					but many more than that have achieved this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Apart from the reverend Gotama<br />
					and the Almsmen<br />
					and the Almswomen<br />
					and the laymen<br />
					whether of the higher life<br />
					or of the world still,<br />
					can you say as much of lay-women<br />
					both in the higher life<br />
					and in the world?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg347"><span class="f2 g"><b>[347]</b></span></a> Not a mere hundred lay-women,<br />
					not two<br />
					or three<br />
					or four<br />
					or five hundred of them,<br />
					but many more than that have achieved these results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had the reverend Gotama alone achieved success in the Doctrine,<br />
					without the Almsmen,<br />
					<a id="pt492" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg492"><span class="f2">[492]</span></a> this higher life of his founding<br />
					would have been incomplete by this constituent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inasmuch, however, as not only he<br />
					but the Almsmen too have succeeded,<br />
					this constituent is not lacking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had success come only to him<br />
					and the Almsmen,<br />
					without the Almswomen,<br />
					the latter constituent would have been wanting, -<br />
					as it is not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had success come only to him<br />
					and the Almsmen<br />
					and the Almswomen,<br />
					without laymen of the higher life -<br />
					or laymen of the world still -<br />
					or lay-women of the higher life -<br />
					or lay-women of the world still -,<br />
					in each case this higher life of his founding<br />
					would have been incomplete by that particular constituent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt493" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg493"><span class="f2">[493]</span></a> Inasmuch, however, as success has come<br />
					to each and all of these classes,<br />
					not a single one of these constituents of completeness is lacking.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as the river Ganges<br />
					streams and flows to the ocean as its bourne<br />
					and finds repose only in the ocean,<br />
					so does Gotama's whole congregation,<br />
					laity as well as Pilgrims,<br />
					stream and flow to Nirvana as its bourne,<br />
					finding repose only in Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					quite wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them,<br />
					even so in many a figure has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the reverend Gotama I come as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask to be admitted as a Pilgrim under him,<br />
					with confirmation therein.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt494" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg494"><span class="f2">[494]</span></a> Vaccha, a former adherent of another sect<br />
					who desires admission to,<br />
					and confirmation in,<br />
					this Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					has first to reside for four months,<br />
					at the end of which period<br />
					discreet Almsmen admit and confirm <a id="pg348"><span class="f2 g"><b>[348]</b></span></a> him as a member of the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the qualification I have recognized.</p>

					<p class="f4">If this is so, sir,<br />
					I will reside for the probationary four months accordingly<br />
					with a view to membership of the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">In due course, the Wanderer Vaccha-gotta<br />
					was admitted and confirmed of the Lord's following.</p>

					<p class="f4">Soon after his confirmation,<br />
					indeed within a fortnight's time,<br />
					the reverend Vaccha-gotta came to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have attained all that is to be attained<br />
					by a non-Arahat's understanding<br />
					and a non-Arahat's knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the Lord to expound the Doctrine to me further.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Vaccha, develop further<br />
					two frames of mind,<br />
					calm and insight,<br />
					the development of which<br />
					will help you to fathom<br />
					various elements of sense-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the full of your desire to have at command<br />
					the divers types of psychic power -<br />
					from being one to become manifold,<br />
					from being manifold to become one,<br />
					to pass at will through wall or fence or hill<br />
					as if it were air,<br />
					to pass in and out of the solid earth<br />
					as if it were water,<br />
					to walk on the water's unbroken surface<br />
					as if it were the solid earth,<br />
					to glide, as you sit serene,<br />
					through the air,<br />
					like a winged bird,<br />
					to touch and to handle the sun and moon<br />
					in their power and might,<br />
					and to extend the sway of your body<br />
					right up to the heavens of Brahma -<br />
					each and all of these manifestations of psychic power<br />
					shall be yours to experience<br />
					<a id="quote">as your mind shall dictate</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the full of your desire to hear,<br />
					with the Ear Celestial,<br />
					<a id="pt495" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg495"><span class="f2">[495]</span></a> which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human ear,<br />
					twofold sounds -<br />
					both the celestial and the human,<br />
					sounds both far and near, -<br />
					all this shall be yours to experience<br />
					as your mind shall dictate.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the full of your desire,<br />
					that your heart should read the hearts of others, -<br />
					knowing the heart where passion dwells as passionate,<br />
					and the passionless heart as passionless,<br />
					the unkind heart as unkind,<br />
					and the kind heart as kind,<br />
					the deluded heart as deluded,<br />
					and <a id="pg349"><span class="f2 g"><b>[349]</b></span></a> the undeluded heart as undeluded,<br />
					the focussed heart as focussed,<br />
					and the unfocussed heart as unfocussed,<br />
					the great heart as great,<br />
					and the little heart as little,<br />
					the inferior heart as inferior,<br />
					and the superior heart as superior,<br />
					the stedfast heart as stedfast,<br />
					and the un-stedfast heart as unstedfast,<br />
					the heart Delivered as Delivered,<br />
					and the heart undelivered as undelivered -<br />
					all this shall be yours to experience<br />
					as your mind shall dictate.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the full of your desire to recall<br />
					your divers existences in the past -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ...<br />
					right up to your rebirth here, -<br />
					all this shall be yours to experience<br />
					as your mind shall dictate.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt496" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg496"><span class="f2">[496]</span></a> To the full of your desire to see,<br />
					with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					creatures in act to pass hence,<br />
					in act to reappear elsewhere,<br />
					creatures either lowly or debonair ...<br />
					in states of bliss and in heaven, -<br />
					all this shall be yours to experience<br />
					as your mind shall dictate.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the full of your desire -<br />
					here and now,<br />
					and of and by yourself -<br />
					to know,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in<br />
					Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					which is without Cankers<br />
					because Cankers have been eradicated, -<br />
					all this shall be yours to experience<br />
					as your mind shall dictate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the venerable Vaccha-gotta,<br />
					glad and grateful to the Lord for his words,<br />
					arose and with salutations<br />
					and deep reverence<br />
					withdrew.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor was it long before he,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					won the prize<br />
					in quest of which young men go forth from home<br />
					to homelessness as Pilgrims,<br />
					that prize of prizes<br />
					which crowns the highest life; -<br />
					even this did he think out<br />
					and realize of and by himself,<br />
					entering on it<br />
					and dwelling therein<br />
					here and now;<br />
					and to him came the knowledge clear<br />
					that for him rebirth was no more;<br />
					that he had lived the highest life;<br />
					that his task was done;<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there was no more of what he had been.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Vaccha-gotta was numbered among the Arahats.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time a large number of Almsmen were on <a id="pg350"><span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span></a> their way to visit the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing them some way off,<br />
					Vaccha-gotta went up to them,<br />
					<a id="pt497" href="../../pali/mn/mn.072.pali.bd.htm#pg497"><span class="f2">[497]</span></a> and,<br />
					on learning their intention to visit the Lord,<br />
					asked them to bow down at the Lord's feet on his behalf<br />
					and in his name to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has been served;<br />
					the Blessed One has been served.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly those Almsmen conveyed his message faithfully to the Lord,<br />
					who remarked that already his own heart<br />
					had read Vaccha-gotta's heart<br />
					and that this Almsman had won the threefold lore<br />
					and had come to great powers and might.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also, deities (he added)<br />
					had brought him the same tidings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
