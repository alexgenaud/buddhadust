					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#koliya">Koḷiyās</a><br />
					- Halidda-vasana is the name of a township of theirs -<br />
					there came to him<br />
					Puṇṇa Koḷiyāputta who was a Bovine,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and Seniya, a naked ascetic <i>(acela)</i> who was a Canine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa, after saluting the Lord,<br />
					took a seat to one side,<br />
					while Seniya, after greetings of courtesy and civility,<br />
					squatted down like a dog.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Puṇṇa to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">This naked ascetic Seniya the Canine<br />
					has set himself an austere task;<br />
					he subsists by scavenging,<br />
					and has for a long time<br />
					punctually discharged the vows of his <a id="pg279"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></a> Canine vocation.</p>

					<p class="f4">What future state<br />
					and what destiny<br />
					await him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Stop, Puṇṇa;<br />
					proceed no further;<br />
					question me not hereon.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time<br />
					and yet a third time<br />
					Puṇṇa repeated his enquiry,<br />
					receiving the third time this answer from the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I told you I disapproved<br />
					and asked you to stop<br />
					and proceed no further with your enquiry,<br />
					yet I will tell you the answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Puṇṇa, a man fully and completely develops the dog's habits,<br />
					the dog's principles of conduct,<br />
					the dog's mind<br />
					and <a id="pt388" href="../../pali/mn/mn.057.pali.bd.htm#pg388"><span class="f2">[388]</span></a> the dog's behaviour,<br />
					then at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					he will pass to be with dogs thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if he holds the view<br />
					that by such principles<br />
					or practices<br />
					or austerities<br />
					or higher life<br />
					he will become a greater or a lesser god,<br />
					then he holds a false view;<br />
					and I say that the man of false views<br />
					has before him one of two future states, -<br />
					namely purgatory<br />
					or rebirth as an animal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is lucky,<br />
					he becomes a dog;<br />
					if he is unlucky,<br />
					he goes to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Seniya,<br />
					the naked ascetic who was a Canine,<br />
					burst into tears and wept.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Lord to Puṇṇa:</p>

					<p class="f4">I told you to stop<br />
					and proceed no further with your enquiries.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Seniya:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not because the Lord spoke as he did concerning me that I weep.</p>

					<p class="f4">But oh!</p>

					<p class="f4">I have - so long<br />
					and so punctually<br />
					discharged the vows of my Canine vocation!</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa here,<br />
					the Bovine,<br />
					has for a long time punctually discharged his Bovine vows.</p>

					<p class="f4">What future state<br />
					and what destiny<br />
					await him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Stop, Seniya;<br />
					proceed no further;<br />
					question me not hereon.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time<br />
					and yet a third time<br />
					Seniya repeated his enquiry,<br />
					receiving the third time<br />
					this answer from the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Though I told you I disapproved<br />
					and asked you to proceed no further with your enquiry,<br />
					yet I will tell you the answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Seniya, a man fully and completely develops the habits of kine,<br />
					the principles of conduct of kine,<br />
					the mind of kine<br />
					and the behaviour <a id="pg280"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span></a> of kine,<br />
					then at the body's dissolution. ...<br />
					<a id="pt389" href="../../pali/mn/mn.057.pali.bd.htm#pg389"><span class="f2">[389]</span></a> kine,<br />
					if he is unlucky,<br />
					he goes to purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Puṇṇa Koḷiyāputta the Bovine<br />
					burst into tears and wept.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Lord to Seniya:</p>

					<p class="f4">I told you to stop<br />
					and proceed no further with your enquiries.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Puṇṇa:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not because the Lord spoke as he did concerning me that I weep.</p>

					<p class="f4">But Oh!</p>

					<p class="f4">I have so long<br />
					and so punctually<br />
					discharged the vows Of my Bovine vocation!</p>

					<p class="f4">I have faith in the Lord<br />
					that he can so preach the Doctrine<br />
					that I shall renounce my bovine practices<br />
					and Seniya his canine practices.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear then, Puṇṇa,<br />
					and hearken;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the listening Puṇṇa the Lord began:</p>

					<p class="f4">I affirm four kinds of actions <i>(kamma)</i><br />
					which I have independently discovered and proved.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are<br />
					(i) actions which are black,<br />
					with black outcome,<br />
					(ii) actions which are bright,<br />
					with bright outcome,<br />
					(iii) actions which are both black and bright,<br />
					with both a black and a bright outcome, and<br />
					(iv) actions which are neither black nor bright,<br />
					with an outcome neither black nor bright,<br />
					conducing to the destruction of karma <i>(kamma)</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) What action is black,<br />
					with black outcome?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who evolves a harmful complex of body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought<br />
					and passes in consequence<br />
					to a harmful realm<br />
					where harmful impressions beset him,<br />
					so that he experiences feelings of harm<br />
					which are painful in the extreme, -<br />
					as do beings <a id="pt390" href="../../pali/mn/mn.057.pali.bd.htm#pg390"><span class="f2">[390]</span></a> in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, from the creature<br />
					proceeds its own future state;<br />
					what it does<br />
					determines what it passes to,<br />
					and the impressions which then beset it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I say creatures are the heirs of their own actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is action which is black,<br />
					with black outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) What action is bright,<br />
					with bright outcome?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who evolves a harmless complex of body,<br />
					speech<br />
					or thought<br />
					and passes in consequence<br />
					to a harmless realm<br />
					where harmless impressions beset him,<br />
					so that he experiences feelings<br />
					devoid of harm<br />
					which <a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> are pleasant in the extreme, -<br />
					as do the Subha-Kiṇṇa gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus from the creature proceeds ...<br />
					heirs of their own actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is action which is bright,<br />
					with bright outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) What action is both black and bright,<br />
					with both a black and a bright outcome?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who evolves complexes of body,<br />
					speech,<br />
					and thought<br />
					which are both harmful and harmless,<br />
					and passes in consequence<br />
					to a realm at once harmful and harmless,<br />
					where both harmful and harmless impressions beset him,<br />
					so that he experiences mixed feelings,<br />
					some harmful and some harmless, -<br />
					as do human beings,<br />
					some gods<br />
					and some whose lot embraces suffering.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus from the creature proceeds ...<br />
					heirs of their own actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is action which is both black and bright,<br />
					with both a black and a bright outcome.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) <a id="pt391" href="../../pali/mn/mn.057.pali.bd.htm#pg391"><span class="f2">[391]</span></a> Lastly, what action is neither black nor bright,<br />
					with an outcome which is neither black nor bright,<br />
					conducing to the destruction of Karma?</p>

					<p class="f4">In this case, it is the mental resolve<br />
					to discard all action<br />
					of the three foregoing types<br />
					which is called action which is neither black nor bright,<br />
					with an outcome which is neither black nor bright,<br />
					conducing to the destruction of Karma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Puṇṇa, are the four types of action affirmed by me,<br />
					which I have independently discerned and proved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Puṇṇa the Bovine said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir; wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as ... etc. down to ...<br />
					may the Lord accept me as a disciple<br />
					from this day forth while life lasts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Seniya, the naked ascetic who was a Canine,<br />
					said the same but ended by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to the Lord as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be it mine to receive admission<br />
					and confirmation as an Almsman with the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> A former sectary of another school, Seniya,<br />
					who seeks admission and confirmation<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule,<br />
					first resides for four months,<br />
					at the end of which four months<br />
					proved Almsmen admit and confirm him as an Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the distinction between persons<br />
					which I recognize.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, former sectaries of other schools<br />
					have first to undergo this four months' probation<br />
					before their admission here,<br />
					then I will reside for four months,<br />
					at the end of wrhich period<br />
					let proved Almsmen admit and confirm me as an Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the naked ascetic Seniya the Canine<br />
					was admitted and confirmed as an Almsman of the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his confirmation<br />
					the reverend Seniya,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					<a id="pt392" href="../../pali/mn/mn.057.pali.bd.htm#pg392"><span class="f2">[392]</span></a> ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					after no long time<br />
					won that prize in quest of which<br />
					young men go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims,<br />
					that prize of prizes<br />
					which crowns the higher life, -<br />
					even this did he think out for himself,<br />
					realize and attain,<br />
					and in this did he dwell,<br />
					convinced that for him<br />
					rebirth was no more,<br />
					that he had lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task was done,<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there was no more of what he had been.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the reverend Seniya was numbered among the Arahats.</p>
