					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					there was, in the realm conquered by Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					a robber named Aŋguli- <a id="pg51"><span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></a> māla,<br />
					a ruffian whose hands were red with blood,<br />
					who was always killing and wounding,<br />
					and showed no mercy to any living creature.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because of him,<br />
					what had been villages were villages no more,<br />
					what had been townships <a id="pt98" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg98"><span class="f2">[98]</span></a> were townships no more,<br />
					and what had been countrysides were countrysides no more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From every human being whom he slew,<br />
					he took a finger<br />
					to make him a necklace<br />
					(and so got his name of 'Necklace of fingers').</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the morning early, the Lord,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into the city for alms<br />
					and on his return after his meal<br />
					first put away his bedding<br />
					and then, with robes and bowl,<br />
					set out on his journey to find the robber Aŋgulimāla.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing him journeying thither,<br />
					neatherds,<br />
					goatherds,<br />
					ploughmen and wayfarers called out: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Don't go that way, recluse!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It will take you to the robber named Aŋgulimāla,<br />
					a ruffian ... make him a necklace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, even when ten,<br />
					twenty,<br />
					thirty or forty people<br />
					band themselves together<br />
					to travel this road,<br />
					the whole company falls into the robber's hands!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus they;<br />
					but, without a word,<br />
					the Lord held on his way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time,<br />
					and yet a third time<br />
					these neatherds and the rest<br />
					repeated their warning;<br />
					but still,<br />
					without a word,<br />
					the Lord held on his way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From some way off<br />
					the robber saw the Lord coming<br />
					and marvelled exceedingly that,<br />
					where even companies of ten to <a id="pt99" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg99"><span class="f2">[99]</span></a> fifty travellers all fell into his hands,<br />
					this solitary recluse should seem<br />
					to be forcing his way alone;<br />
					and the robber was minded to slay 'this recluse.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So, armed with sword and buckler,<br />
					and with his bow and quiver,<br />
					the robber followed up the Lord's trail.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the Lord manifested his psychic powers<br />
					so that, while he himself was proceeding at his wonted pace,<br />
					the robber,<br />
					for all his efforts,<br />
					could not catch him up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the robber: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is a wonderful and marvellous thing!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Heretofore, I could always overtake an elephant,<br />
					or horse,<br />
					or carriage,<br />
					or deer,<br />
					when going full speed;<br />
					and yet here <a id="pg52"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></a> am I unable,<br />
					despite all my efforts,<br />
					to overtake this recluse<br />
					while he proceeds at his wonted pace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he stopped<br />
					and shouted to the Lord to stop.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I have stopped, Aŋgulimāla;<br />
					you stop too.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the robber:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These Sakyan recluses speak truth<br />
					and are true to their word.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet here is this recluse who,<br />
					while he still walks on,<br />
					says he has stopped<br />
					and bids me stop too;<br />
					I had better ask him about it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the robber addressed the Lord in these lines:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">You who profess to stop, still march ahead;<br />
							I, who have stopped, am told by you I've not;<br />
							- Explain how you have stopped while I have not.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Yes, I have stopped; for, never violence<br />
							do I to any. - life you still destroy.<br />
							- Thus I have stopped indeed, but you stop not!</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt100" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg100"><span class="f2">[100]</span></a> At last this sage revered has tracked me down!<br />
							And now at last thy hallow'd utterance<br />
							makes me for ever evil deeds renounce!</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">He spoke, and into deep abyss his arms<br />
							the robber flung: low at the Master's feet<br />
							he craved admission to the Brotherhood.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">The Buddha, sage compassionate, the guide<br />
							of gods and men, said: 'Almsman,follow me';<br />
							and Almsman on that summons he became!</p>
							
					<p class="f4">With Aŋgulimāla as his Almsman in attendance,<br />
					the Lord now proceeded on his way<br />
					to the pleasaunce in Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this very time<br />
					the portals of the king's inner palace<br />
					were beset by a huge crowd loudly shouting<br />
					that in the realm he had conquered<br />
					there was a robber named Aŋgulimāla,<br />
					a ruffian ... make him a necklace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppress him, sire, they cried.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning early Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					with five hundred horse,<br />
					left the city for the pleasaunce,<br />
					and, after driving as far as the ground was passable for his carriage,<br />
					proceeded thence on foot to the Lord<br />
					and <a id="pt101" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg101"><span class="f2">[101]</span></a> after greetings<br />
					took a seat to one side,<br />
					thus to be addressed by the Lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the matter, sire?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is there trouble with Seniya Bimbisāra of <a id="pg53"><span class="f2 g"><b>[53]</b></span></a> Magadha,<br />
					or with the Licchavis of Vesālī<br />
					or with any other hostile powers?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No trouble at all of that sort, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In my realms there is a robber named Aŋgulimāla<br />
					... make him a necklace;<br />
					and I shall never suppress him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If now, sire,<br />
					you were to see Aŋgulimāla with his hair and beard off,<br />
					in the yellow robes,<br />
					as a Pilgrim who kills not,<br />
					steals not,<br />
					lies not,<br />
					eats but one meal a day,<br />
					and leads the higher life in virtue and goodness, -<br />
					what would you do to him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sir, I would salute him,<br />
					or rise to meet him,<br />
					or would invite him to be seated,<br />
					or invite him to accept robes and other requisites,<br />
					or I would extend to him the defence,<br />
					protection and safeguards<br />
					which are his due.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But how could the sway of such virtue<br />
					ever extend to one so wicked and depraved?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At that moment the reverend Aŋgulimāla was seated quite close to the Lord,<br />
					who, stretching forth his right arm, said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, sire, is Aŋgulimāla!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereat the king in his alarm<br />
					became dumbfounded,<br />
					with every hair of his body standing erect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing this, the Lord said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fear not, sire; fear not;<br />
					there is no cause for fear here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the king's fears <a id="pt102" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg102"><span class="f2">[102]</span></a> and alarms abated;<br />
					and across to the reverend Aŋgulimāla he went,<br />
					saying:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is your reverence indeed Aŋgulimāla?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sire.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What, sir, was your father's family,<br />
					and your mother's?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My father was a Gagga, sire,<br />
					and my mother a Manṭāṇi.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Be of good cheer,<br />
					Gagga Manṭāṇi-putta;<br />
					I will take care to supply you with all requisites.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at the time the reverend Aŋgulimāla was resident in the wilds,<br />
					subsisting on alms,<br />
					and wearing clothes from the dust-heap<br />
					not exceeding three in number.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he declined the king's offer<br />
					on the ground that he had already got<br />
					his full three robes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the king went across to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					seated himself to one side,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sir,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					what a tamer of the <a id="pg54"><span class="f2 g"><b>[54]</b></span></a> untamed the Lord is,<br />
					how he quells the unquelled,<br />
					and how he calms the uncalmed!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here is one whom I could not subdue<br />
					with cudgel and sword;<br />
					but without either cudgel or sword<br />
					the Lord has subdued him!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And now, sir,<br />
					I must be going,<br />
					for I have much to do and attend to.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When your majesty pleases.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, rising from his seat,<br />
					the king saluted the Lord with deep reverence and withdrew.</p>

					<p class="f4">Early one morning the reverend Aŋgulimāla,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into Sāvatthī for alms and there,<br />
					in the course of his round for alms,<br />
					saw a woman in difficult and protracted labour.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The sight <a id="pt103" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg103"><span class="f2">[103]</span></a> brought him the thought how foul humanity was.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After his meal he came back to the Lord<br />
					to tell what he had seen and what he had thought.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Go back then to the city,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					and say to the woman: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From my birth onwards, sister,<br />
					I am not aware that, wittingly,<br />
					I have ever robbed of life<br />
					aught that lives;<br />
					may this my solemn protestation<br />
					bring weal to you<br />
					and weal to your child unborn!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But that, sir, would,<br />
					be a deliberate lie;<br />
					for, I have wittingly taken many a life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Go back then to the city,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					and say to the woman: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From my Noble Birth onwards, sister,<br />
					I am not aware that, wittingly,<br />
					I have ever robbed of life<br />
					aught that lives;<br />
					may this my solemn protestation<br />
					bring weal to you<br />
					and weal to your child unborn!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Obediently, he went back to the woman<br />
					to make this solemn protestation;<br />
					and all went well with mother and child.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ere long, the reverend Aŋgulimāla,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous ardent and purged of self,<br />
					won the prize in quest of which<br />
					young men go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims,<br />
					that prize of prizes which crowns the highest life: -<br />
					even this did he, here and now,<br />
					think out for himself,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in;<br />
					and to him came the conviction:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now <a id="pt104" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg104"><span class="f2">[104]</span></a> for me there is no more of what 1 nave been!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus the reverend Aŋgulimāla<br />
					was numbered among the arahats.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg55"><span class="f2 g"><b>[55]</b></span></a> In the morning early,<br />
					when, duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					Aŋgulimāla had gone into Sāvatthī for alms,<br />
					he was hit by a clod flung by one man,<br />
					by a club flung by a second<br />
					and by a potsherd flung by a third,<br />
					so that it was with a broken head<br />
					streaming with blood,<br />
					with his bowl smashed,<br />
					and with his cloak in tatters,<br />
					that he presented himself before the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing him drawing near,<br />
					the Lord said to Aŋgulimāla: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Endure it all, brahmin;<br />
					endure it all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What you are suffering now<br />
					is the harvest of past deeds<br />
					which might otherwise have kept you<br />
					in the torments of purgatory<br />
					for many a year,<br />
					yea, for hundreds and thousands of years.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he realized in solitary meditation<br />
					the bliss of his Deliverance,<br />
					the reverend Aŋgulimāla now burst into this heartfelt utterance:-</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Whoso shows zeal, where zeal was none,<br />
							whoso with virtue clokes his past,<br />
							whoso in youth to Buddha cleaves,<br />
							- he, like the moon, floods earth with light.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">My foes, this gospel hear, this creed embrace,<br />
							and follow wisdom's sons who cleave to it.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2"><a id="pt105" href="../../pali/mn/mn.086.pali.bd.htm#pg105"><span class="f2">[105]</span></a>	Love's message, meek forbearance, hear, my foes,<br />
							- in season hear, and let your lives conform.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">He who has garner'd Peace, harms neither me<br />
							nor any man, but shields both weak and strong.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Ditchers guide rills; his shaft the fletcher shapes;<br />
							joiners shape wood; -but sages shape themselves.<br />
							Constraining goad, compelling lash tames some;<br />
							- with neither club nor sword our Saint tamed me.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">My name is 'Harmless,' though I harmful was;<br />
							bnt rightly now am named, for I harm none.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">As' Finger-Necklace; I a bandit lived,<br />
							and whirled down Stream, till He brought me to Land.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">As 'Finger-Necklace,' I was steeped in blood;<br />
							saved now, no tethers bind me still to life.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">My whilom guilt, with all its heritage<br />
							<a id="pg56"><span class="f2 g"><b>[56]</b></span></a> of future woe, has found its outcome here;<br />
							- of my estate I'm lord; no debt I owe.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Insensate folly ne'er can rise to zeal,<br />
							that zeal which wisdom's priceless treasure is.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Forget not zeal in pleasure's hot pursuit;<br />
							for, zeal by Ecstasy to bliss attains.</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">In blessing came, and still abides, my Call when<br />
							'mong the warring creeds I chose the best.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">In blessing came, and still abides, my Call;<br />
							- the threefold lore is mine; I've lived His creed.</p>
