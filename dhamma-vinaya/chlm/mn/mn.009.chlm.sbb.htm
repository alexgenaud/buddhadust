					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The man of right ideas is hailed as such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, in what respects does the disciple of the Noble become right in his ideas?</p>

					<p class="f4">In what respects are his ideas impeccable?</p>

					<p class="f4">In what respects has he gained absolute clarity in the doctrine<br />
					and mastered its truth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"We would have journeyed from afar, reverend sir,<br />
					to learn the meaning of this utterance<br />
					from the reverend Sāriputta's lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, vouchsafe to set forth its meaning for us<br />
					to treasure up in our memories.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then listen, reverend sirs,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, reverend sir, said they in response,<br />
					and Sāriputta spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple of the Noble<br />
					comprehends that which is wrong<br />
					and the root from which it springs,<br />
					when he comprehends that which is right<br />
					and the root from which it springs,<br />
					thereby he becomes right in his ideas,<br />
					his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					he has gained absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and mastered its truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what is the wrong and the right?<br />
					and what are their respective roots?</p>

					<p class="f4">Killing is wrong,<br />
					theft is wrong,<br />
					sensuality is wrong,<br />
					lying is wrong,<br />
					calumny is wrong,<br />
					reviling is wrong,<br />
					chattering is wrong,<br />
					covetise is wrong,<br />
					harmfulness is wrong,<br />
					and wrong ideas are wrong.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this is called<br />
					that which is wrong;<br />
					and its roots are -<br />
					greed,<br />
					hate<br />
					and delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is that which is right?</p>

					<p class="f4">To keep from killing,<br />
					theft,<br />
					sensuality,<br />
					lying,<br />
					calumny,<br />
					reviling,<br />
					and chattering;<br />
					to be void of covetise<br />
					and harmful- <a id="pg34"><span class="f2 g"><b>[34]</b></span></a> ness,<br />
					and to hold right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what is called right;<br />
					and its roots are freedom from greed,<br />
					freedom from hate,<br />
					and freedom from delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple of the Noble<br />
					has this understanding<br />
					of what is wrong<br />
					and of what is right,<br />
					and of their respective roots,<br />
					then - by putting from him<br />
					every tendency to passion,<br />
					by dispelling every tendency to repugnance,<br />
					by venting every tendency<br />
					to the idea and conceit<br />
					'I am,'<br />
					by shedding ignorance,<br />
					and by developing knowledge -<br />
					he makes an end of Ill here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">After expressing their satisfaction and gratitude to Sāriputta,<br />
					those Almsmen put to him the further question<br />
					whether there was yet another way<br />
					by which the disciple became right in his ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes," answered Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When he understands Sustenance,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four Sustenances<br />
					which either maintain existing creatures<br />
					or help those yet to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">First of these is material sustenance,<br />
					coarse or delicate;<br />
					contact is the second;<br />
					intention is the third;<br />
					and the fourth is consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the rise of craving<br />
					comes the rise of Sustenance,<br />
					and with the cessation of craving<br />
					comes also the cessation of Sustenance,<br />
					the course to which is the Noble Eightfold Path, - namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple thus understands Sustenance,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to its cessation,<br />
					that is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">After expressing their satisfaction and gratitude to Sāriputta,<br />
					those Almsmen put to him the further question<br />
					whether there was yet another way<br />
					by which the disciple became right in his ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes", answered Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he understands <a id="pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></a><br />
					Ill,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ill is birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					sickness,<br />
					and death;<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					wailing,<br />
					depression of body and mind;<br />
					also not getting what one desires;<br />
					together with, in brief,<br />
					the fivefold attachments to existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ill is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, first, what is the origin of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">This denotes every craving that leads to rebirth,<br />
					that has to do with delight and passion,<br />
					delighting now in this object and now in that, - namely,<br />
					cravings for pleasures of sense,<br />
					for continuing existence,<br />
					or for annihilation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what is the cessation of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">This denotes the absolute and passionless cessation<br />
					of the self-same cravings,<br />
					their abandonment and renunciation,<br />
					deliverance from them,<br />
					and aversion for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, what is the course that leads to the cessation of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is precisely the Noble Eightfold Path, namely,<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple thus understands Ill,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to the cessation of Ill,<br />
					that is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple understands decay and death,<br />
					their origin,<br />
					their cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">Decay is when in any creature in its class<br />
					decay and decadence set in<br />
					with broken teeth,<br />
					grey hair,<br />
					and wrinkles,<br />
					when the term of life is drawing to a close<br />
					and the faculties are spent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Death is when any creature deceases from its class,<br />
					goes hence,<br />
					breaks up,<br />
					departs,<br />
					expires and dies,<br />
					when the elements break up<br />
					and the corpse is buried.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the arising of birth<br />
					comes the arising of decay and death;<br />
					from the cessation of birth<br />
					comes the cessation of decay and death,<br />
					the course whereto is just the Noble Eightfold Path, - namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple thus understands decay and death,<br />
					<a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> their origin,<br />
					their cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation,<br />
					then, - by putting from him every tendency,<br />
					that is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple understands birth,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is when any creature comes to be born<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					or produced,<br />
					to issue<br />
					or appear<br />
					in this or that class,<br />
					when the factors of existence make their appearance<br />
					and senses are acquired.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the arising of existence<br />
					comes the arising of birth;<br />
					from the cessation of existence<br />
					comes the cessation of birth;<br />
					and the course which leads to the cessation of birth<br />
					is precisely the Noble Eightfold Path,<br />
					namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />

					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are three planes of existence, -<br />
					sensuous,<br />
					corporeal,<br />
					and incorporeal.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the arising of attachment<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					that their existence takes its rise,<br />
					and from attachment's cessation<br />
					comes the cessation of existence,<br />
					the course whereto is just the Noble Eightfold Path, - namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />

					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four <a id="pg37"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></a> attachments, -<br />
					to sensuous pleasure,<br />
					to speculative ideas,<br />
					to 'good works'<br />
					and to soul-theories.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the arising of craving<br />

					<p class="f4">There are six kinds of craving, -<br />
					for forms,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					smells,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					touch,<br />
					and mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the arising of feeling<br />

					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">After expressing their satisfaction and gratitude to Sāriputta,<br />
					those Almsmen put to him the further question<br />
					whether there was yet another way<br />
					by which the disciple became right in his ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes", answered Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple understands the plastic forces,<br />
					their origin,<br />
					their cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are three kinds of plastic forces, -<br />
					namely,<br />
					of the body,<br />
					of speech,<br />
					and of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the arising of ignorance<br />
					that these forces arise,<br />
					and from the cessation of ignorance<br />
					that there comes the cessation of plastic forces,<br />
					the course whereto is just the Noble Eightfold Path, namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple thus understands plastic forces,<br />
					that is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple understands ignorance,<br />

					its cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance denotes lack of knowledge of Ill,<br />
					of its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and of the course which leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is from the arising of the Cankers<br />
					that ignorance arises,<br />
					and from their cessation<br />
					comes the cessation of ignorance,<br />
					the course whereto is just the Noble Eightfold Path, namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes", answered Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple understands a Canker,<br />
					its origin,<br />
					its cessation,<br />
					and the course leading to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what are these?</p>

					<p class="f4">There are three Cankers, -<br />
					the Canker of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and the Canker of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg40"><span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></a> It is from the arising of ignorance<br />
					that Cankers arise,<br />
					and from its cessation<br />
					comes their cessation,<br />
					the course whereto is just the Noble Eightfold Path, namely<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the disciple of the Noble has this understanding of Cankers,<br />
					of their origin,<br />
					of their cessation,<br />
					and of the course which leads to their cessation,<br />
					then - by putting from him<br />
					every tendency to passion,<br />
					by dispelling every tendency to repugnance,<br />
					by venting every tendency to the idea and conceit<br />
					'I am'<br />
					by shedding ignorance,<br />
					and by developing knowledge -<br />
					he makes an end of Ill here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he is right in his ideas,<br />
					that is how his ideas are impeccable,<br />
					that is how he gains absolute clarity in the Doctrine<br />
					and masters its truth."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the reverend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what he had said.</p>

					<p>Note. - On this scholastic compilation, here attributed to Sāriputta, see the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14">14th</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">15th</a> Suttas (attributed to Gotama himself) of the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> and the Introductions to the translations of those Suttas at the beginning of the second volume of the <i>Dialogues</i>. It will be noted that <i>avijja</i> figures both as a cause and as a result of the <i>āsavas;</i> according to <i>Bu.</i> it is equivalent to <i>moha</i> (or illusion) supra, where it is defined as lack of knowledge.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Bu.</i>  takes <i>jātī</i> here as conception and the next term <i>(sañjātī)</i> as parturition; he limits issue to emerging from egg and womb, and understands 'appear' as birth either from moisture <i>(saɱseda-yoni)</i> or without ostensible parents <i>(opapātika-yoni).</i> See <i>Dialogues</i> I, 201, II, 338.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Upādāna.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> On this 'elusive' term <i>sankhāra</i> (variously rendered syntheses, conditions, confections and conditions precedent in the <i>Dialogues</i>; and elsewhere as activities and synergies), see <i>Buddhist Psych. Ethics,</i> 2nd edition, p. x. <i>Bu.</i> here observes as follows: - <i>abhisankharaṇa-lakkhaṇo sankhāro.</i> At Dīgha III, 211, occurs the passage: <i>sabbe sattā āhāra-ṭṭhitikā, sabbe sattā sankhāra-ṭṭhitikā,</i> - on which <i>Bu.</i>  observes: <i>imasmim pi visajjane heṭṭhā vutta-paccayo va attano phalassa sankharaṇato sankhāro ti vutto; iti heṭṭhā āhāra-paccao kathito, idha sankhāra-paccayo ti ayam ettha heṭṭhimato viseso; heṭṭhā nippariyāy-āhāro gahito, idha pariyāy-āhāro ti evaɱ gahito</i> (<i>i.e.</i> the second clause in the Dīgha quotation is a particularized version of the preceding general expression that all creatures persist through food). I take <i>sankhāra</i> therefore to be the subsequent elaboration or digestion of the Sustenance till it becomes an integral part of the organism; by metabolism, occasioned by plastic forces.</p>
