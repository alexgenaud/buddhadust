<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 144. Sāriputta and Maha Cunda visit Channa who is dying a painful death. Channa announces he will 'take the knife' (commit suicide). Sāriputta questions him as to his understanding of Dhamma and Maha Cunda recites for him a saying of the Buddha warning against the wavering that results from attachments. Later, after Channa has 'taken the knife' Sāriputta questions the Buddha as to Channa's fate. The Buddha states that his was a blameless end." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					the reverend Mahā-Cunda<br />
					and the reverend Channa<br />
					were living on the heights of Vulture's Peak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Channa fell sick<br />
					and was in pain and dangerously ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At eventide, on rising up from his meditations,<br />
					Sāriputta went to Mahā-Cunda<br />
					to suggest they should go and ask after Channa's condition.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So together the two went to the sick man<br />
					and after greetings<br />
					asked him <a id="pt264" href="../../pali/mn/mn.144.pali.bd.htm#pg264"><span class="f2">[264]</span></a> whether he was getting better<br />
					and able to hold on,<br />
					whether his pains were leaving him<br />
					and not coming on,<br />
					and whether he found himself progressing<br />
					and not losing ground with his pain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not at all, Sāriputta;<br />
					I am not getting better but worse;<br />
					... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.097.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 97</a>)</i> ...<br />
					I am losing ground;<br />
					my pains grow on me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I shall use a knife on myself;<br />
					I have no wish to live.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Don't think of killing yourself, Channa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Bear up, as we wish you to bear up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you lack food that will do you good,<br />
					I will get it for you;<br />
					if you lack medicines that will do you good,<br />
					I will get them for you;<br />
					if you lack a suitable personal attendant,<br />
					I myself will attend on you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But don't think of killing yourself;<br />
					bear up as we wish you to bear up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Sāriputta;<br />
					I have no lack of suitable food or drugs;<br />
					nor do I lack a suitable attendant.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, and I <a id="pg306"><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span></a> have long been a votary of the Lord<br />
					with unbroken satisfaction to myself,<br />
					as beseems a disciple.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But take it from me, Sāriputta,<br />
					that I shall use a knife on myself<br />
					and that without blame attaching to me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I should like, Channa,<br />
					if you will allow me,<br />
					to put one small point to you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do so, Sāriputta;<br />
					and when I have heard it,<br />
					I will answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In sight<br />
					and in ocular perception<br />
					and in the objects of ocular perception,<br />
					do you hold that this is mine,<br />
					I am this <a id="pt265" href="../../pali/mn/mn.144.pali.bd.htm#pg265"><span class="f2">[265]</span></a> or <br />
					this is my Self?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you hold this of hearing<br />
					or the four other Senses?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No Sāriputta;<br />
					I hold the precise opposite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is it that you see and discern<br />
					in each and every one of these<br />
					that leads you to intend what you do?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their cessation, Sāriputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt266" href="../../pali/mn/mn.144.pali.bd.htm#pg266"><span class="f2">[266]</span></a>	You must think too, Channa,<br />
					of the Lord's eternal teaching<br />
					that agitation marks the enthralled;<br />
					that the un-enthralled know no agitation;<br />
					that, if there be no agitation,<br />
					there is serenity;<br />
					that with serenity there is no craving;<br />
					that without craving<br />
					there is no round of rebirths;<br />
					that without the round of rebirths<br />
					there is no passing hence,<br />
					no arising elsewhere;<br />
					that without any passing hence<br />
					or arising elsewhere<br />
					there is no further term<br />
					in this world<br />
					or elsewhere<br />
					or both;<br />
					and that thus alone is Ill ended for ever.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With these exhortations to Channa,<br />
					Sāriputta and Mahā-Cunda rose up and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They had not been gone long<br />
					when Channa used the knife on himself;<br />
					and they brought the news to the Lord,<br />
					asking what future awaited Channa<br />
					and what his destiny would be.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Did not the Almsman Channa<br />
					insist on his blamelessness to you, Sāriputta?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In his Vajjian village of Pubbajira<br />
					Channa's familiars and associates are all blameworthy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No doubt, Sāriputta;<br />
					but it is not in that sense<br />
					that I use the term blameworthy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That term I apply<br />
					to a man who divests himself of this body<br />
					because he wants <a id="pg307"><span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span></a> another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This was not the case with Channa,<br />
					who was blameless in using the knife upon himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Sāriputta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
