					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he announced to the Almsmen that he would expound to them a summary and exposition,<br />
					and thus began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">An Almsman's thinking should always be so conducted<br />
					that, as he thinks,<br />
					his mind may not either be<br />
					externally diffused and dissipated<br />
					or be internally set,<br />
					and that through non-dependence<br />
					he may be imperturbed,<br />
					so that, with his mind thus secure,<br />
					birth, old-age and death<br />
					and the arising of all Ill<br />
					do not happen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having said this,<br />
					the Lord rose and withdrew to his cell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He had not been gone long<br />
					when the Almsmen reflected that<br />
					the Lord had left them with this terse summary<br />
					without giving them the detailed exposition.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Wondering who would furnish the detailed exposition,<br />
					they decided <a id="pt224" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg224"><span class="f2">[224]</span></a> to go to the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna<br />
					and he ... <i>(as in <a href="mn.133.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 133</a>)</i> ... <a id="pt225" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg225"><span class="f2">[225]</span></a> at last consented,<br />
					telling them that he took the detailed meaning<br />
					of the Lord's pregnant utterance to be as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The mind is said to be<br />
					externally diffused and dissipated<br />
					if, when his eye sees a form,<br />
					an Almsman's mind pursues the phenomena of form<br />
					with avid greed and passion for such phenomena.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same applies to things heard,<br />
					odours and savours, things touched and mental objects.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The mind that escapes being externally diffused and dissipated<br />
					on any such phenomena as aforesaid<br />
					is said to be undiflused and undissipated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg284"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></a> <a id="pt226" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg226"><span class="f2">[226]</span></a> When, divested of lusts and of wrong dispositions,<br />
					the Almsman develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy<br />
					and all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection,<br />
					then his mind,<br />
					pursuing the zest and satisfaction of such aloofness<br />
					with avid greed and passion,<br />
					is said to be set internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, by shedding observation and reflection,<br />
					he develops and dwells in the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					in that inward tranquillity and focussing of heart,<br />
					beyond observation and reflection,<br />
					which is bred of rapt concentration, -<br />
					then his mind,<br />
					pursuing rapt concentration's zest and satisfaction<br />
					with avid greed and passion therefor,<br />
					is said to be set internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, losing all passion for zest,<br />
					he develops and dwells in the Third Ecstasy<br />
					in poised indifference,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					that ease which the Noble Ones mean when they say:<br />
					He that has poise and mindfulness lives at ease, -<br />
					then his mind,<br />
					pursuing with avid greed and passion<br />
					the heart's ease engendered by poise,<br />
					is said to be set internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Lastly, when, by discarding ease and un-ease<br />
					and by the disappearance of pleasant and unpleasant emotions,<br />
					the Almsman both develops and dwells in the Fourth Ecstasy<br />
					in perfect poise and mindfulness,-<br />
					then his mind,<br />
					pursuing poised indifference<br />
					with avid greed and passion,<br />
					is said to be set internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt227" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg227"><span class="f2">[227]</span></a> The mind is said to be internally unset,<br />
					when, in each of the four successive Ecstasies,<br />
					there is no such pursuit<br />
					with avid greed and passion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, what, sirs, is non-dependent perturbation? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed average man -<br />
					who has no vision of the Noble<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who has no vision of the Excellent<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine,<br />
					and consequently regards<br />
					form as Self,<br />
					or Self as having form,<br />
					or form as in Self,<br />
					or Self as in form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The form alters and changes;<br />
					its alteration and change<br />
					engage his consciousness;<br />
					and from his mind being engaged<br />
					with the alteration and change<br />
					there <a id="pg285"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span></a> are bred perturbations and growths<br />
					of states of consciousness<br />
					which take possession of his heart,<br />
					so that he becomes frightened and upset,<br />
					and loth to be cut adrift,<br />
					and suffers perturbation<br />
					through losing the old dependence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What applies to form<br />
					applies equally to feelings - <a id="pt228" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg228"><span class="f2">[228]</span></a> to perception -<br />
					to the plastic forces -<br />
					and to consciousness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how there arises non-dependent perturbation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is non-dependent non-perturbation? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an instructed disciple of the Noble<br />
					who has vision of the Noble<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who has vision of the Excellent<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine; -<br />
					he does not regard<br />
					form as Self,<br />
					or Self as having form,<br />
					or form as in Self,<br />
					or Self as in form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The form alters and changes;<br />
					its alteration and change<br />
					do not engage his consciousness;<br />
					and no perturbations or growths<br />
					of (wrong) dispositions<br />
					to take possession of his heart<br />
					are bred from his mind being engaged<br />
					with the alteration and change of the form;<br />
					and in consequence he does not become frightened or upset<br />
					or loth to be cut adrift;<br />
					he suffers no perturbations<br />
					through losing dependence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What applies to form<br />
					applies equally to feelings -<br />
					to perception -<br />
					to the constituents<br />
					and to consciousness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how non-dependent non-perturbation comes about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, sirs, is what I take to be<br />
					the detailed meaning of the Lord's pregnant utterance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt229" href="../../pali/mn/mn.138.pali.bd.htm#pg229"><span class="f2">[229]</span></a> Should you so desire, however,<br />
					your reverences can go to the Lord himself and ask him,<br />
					treasuring up what he reveals.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After expressing their delight and thanks<br />
					to the venerable Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					those Almsmen went off to the Lord,<br />
					to whom they related what had passed<br />
					since he had left them with his pregnant utterance,<br />
					and to whom they repeated,<br />
					word for word and syllable for syllable,<br />
					the way in which Mahā-Kaccāna had expounded its meaning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Learned, Almsmen, is Mahā-Kaccāna;<br />
					full of lore is he.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Had you asked me myself the meaning,<br />
					I should have explained it exactly as he has.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the meaning<br />
					and you should treasure it up accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a> Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
