					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/mn/mn.127.horn.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>] [<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/mnl/mn/mn.127.upal.mnl.htm#p1">upal</a>]</span> T<span class="f2"><b>HUS</b></span> have I heard:</p>

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the carpenter Pañcakanga sent a messenger<br />
					<a id="pt145" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg145"><span class="f2">[145]</span></a> - as he was himself busy<br />
					and engaged on the King's business -<br />
					respectfully to ask,<br />
					in his name,<br />
					the venerable Anuruddha to come with three others<br />
					to dinner the next day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anuruddha silently consented<br />
					and early next morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					betook him to the carpenters abode<br />
					and sat down on the seat set for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the carpenter<br />
					with his <a id="pg240"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span></a> own hands<br />
					served up an excellent meal<br />
					and, when Anuruddha had had his fill,<br />
					sat himself on a lower seat to one side, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Some Elders have told me here<br />
					to develop the heart's Deliverance which is 'boundless,'<br />
					while others have told me<br />
					to develop the heart's Deliverance which is 'vast.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now are the two things distinct<br />
					<a id="pt146" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg146"><span class="f2">[146]</span></a> with differing attributes,<br />
					or are they the same<br />
					with only a difference in attributes?</p>

					<p class="f4">Say what strikes you, sir;<br />
					it will clarify your ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wnat I think is<br />
					that the two are the same,<br />
					differing only in attributes.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are two distinct things,<br />
					with differing attributes,<br />
					as I will now proceed to explain: -</p>

					<p class="f4">What is boundless Deliverance? -</p>

					<p class="f4">If an Almsman dwells<br />
					with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second quarter -<br />
					a third quarter -<br />
					the fourth quarter of the world-,<br />
					if he dwells with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					all-embracing and vast,<br />
					beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hatred or malice;<br />
					and if, as with thoughts of love,<br />
					so he has radiant thoughts of pity,<br />
					of compassion,<br />
					of poised equanimity<br />
					all-embracing and abounding,<br />
					beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hatred or malice; -<br />
					this is what is termed<br />
					the heart's Deliverance that is boundless.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is vast Deliverance of the heart? -</p>

					<p class="f4">If an Almsman pervades and imbues a single tree<br />
					with the idea of vastness,<br />
					that is termed vast Deliverance of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">If with the idea of vastness<br />
					he pervades and imbues two or three trees, -<br />
					or a field -<br />
					<a id="pt147" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg147"><span class="f2">[147]</span></a> or two or three fields -<br />
					or a kingdom -<br />
					or two or three kingdoms, -<br />
					that too is termed vast Deliverance of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">If with the idea of vastness<br />
					he pervades and imbues the earth<br />
					right up to ocean's shores,<br />
					that too is termed vast Deliverance of the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus you will understand<br />
					that the two things are distinct,<br />
					with differing attributes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are four states of re-birth. -</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man absorbs the idea of lesser brilliancy,<br />
					he at the body's dissolution <a id="pg241"><span class="f2 g"><b>[241]</b></span></a> after death<br />
					is reborn (accordingly) among the Parittābhā gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he absorbs the idea of boundless brilliancy,<br />
					he is reborn accordingly among the Appamāṇābha gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he absorbs the idea of tarnished brilliancy,<br />
					he is reborn accordingly among the Sankiliṭṭhābha gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, again, he absorbs the idea of pure brilliancy,<br />
					then at the body's dissolution after death he is reborn accordingly among the Parisuddhābha gods.</p>

					<p class="f4">When those deities are assembled together,<br />
					they manifestly differ in hue<br />
					though not in brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as there is a difference in flame<br />
					but not in brilliancy<br />
					among a number of oil-lamps brought into a house,<br />
					so, when those deities are assembled together,<br />
					<a id="pt148" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg148"><span class="f2">[148]</span></a> they manifestly differ<br />
					in hue though not in brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">It comes to pass,<br />
					when those deities are departing on their several ways,<br />
					that, as they depart,<br />
					a difference is manifest<br />
					both in their hue and in their brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when all those lamps<br />
					are being brought out of that_house,<br />
					they manifestly differ<br />
					both in flame and in brilliancy,<br />
					so, when those deities are departing on their several ways,<br />
					there is a difference manifest<br />
					both in their hue and in their brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">No thought have they<br />
					whether their lot to-day will continue always,<br />
					without change and everlastingly;<br />
					nay, wheresoever they find themselves,<br />
					there they are glad to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as flies<br />
					borne along in pingo or basket<br />
					have no thought whether their lot to-day<br />
					will continue always,<br />
					without change and everlastingly;<br />
					nay, wheresoever they find themselves,<br />
					there they are glad to be; -<br />
					just in the same way those deities<br />
					take no thought whether their lot of to-day<br />
					will continue always,<br />
					without change and everlastingly;<br />
					nay, wheresoever they find themselves,<br />
					there they are glad to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point the reverend Abhiya Kaccāna said to the reverend Anuruddha: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Good indeed;<br />
					but I have one question further on this. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Are the brilliant deities<br />
					all of lesser brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or are some of them of boundless brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">That is settled by their state of rebirth; -<br />
					some are of lesser<br />
					and some of boundless brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg242"><span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span></a> What is the cause and condition whereby,<br />
					though those deities have all alike been reborn into a single class of gods,<br />
					<a id="pt149" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg149"><span class="f2">[149]</span></a> some are of lesser<br />
					and some of boundless brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me in reply ask you, Kaccāna,<br />
					a question to which you will give such answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which do you think gives the vaster scope of the two trains of meditation, -<br />
					the Almsman who pervades and imbues a single tree<br />
					with the idea of vastness,<br />
					or the Almsman who works from two or three trees?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which train of meditation gives the vaster scope, -<br />
					the Almsman's who works from two or three trees<br />
					or the Almsman's who works from a field?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which train gives the vaster scope, -<br />
					the Almsman's who works from a single field<br />
					or the Almsman's who works from two or three fields?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which train gives the vaster scope, -<br />
					the Almsman's who works from two or three fields<br />
					or <a id="pt150" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg150"><span class="f2">[150]</span></a> the Almsman's who works from a kingdom?</p>

					<p class="f4">or from two or three kingdoms?</p>

					<p class="f4">or from the whole earth<br />
					right up to ocean's shores?</p>

					<p class="f4">In each case,<br />
					the latter of the two.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Kaccana, is the cause and condition whereby,<br />
					though these deities have all alike been reborn into a single class of gods,<br />
					some are of lesser and some of boundless brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, indeed Anuruddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have yet another question to ask.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are all brilliant deities tarnished in brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">or are some of them of pure brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt151" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg151"><span class="f2">[151]</span></a>	Assuredly, the brilliancy of some is tarnished<br />
					and of others pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, Anuruddha, is the cause and condition why,<br />
					though these deities have all alike been reborn into a single class of gods,<br />
					some are of tarnished and others of pure brilliancy?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will give you an illustration,<br />
					Kaccāna; -<br />
					an illustration often aids a man of intelligence to comprehend.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg243"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span></a> It is just like a burning oil-lamp<br />
					which has got foul oil<br />
					and a foul wick;<br />
					their combined foulness<br />
					make the lamp burn dimly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way,<br />
					if an Almsman absorbs the idea of tarnished brilliancy,<br />
					his carnal desires are not subdued,<br />
					his obduracy is not banished,<br />
					his flurry and worry are not educated out of him;<br />
					and these combined shortcomings<br />
					make the Almsman's light burn dimly,<br />
					so that at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					he is reborn among the gods of tarnished brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, it is just like a burning oil-lamp<br />
					which has got pure oil<br />
					and a pure wick;<br />
					their combined purity<br />
					make the lamp burn without dimness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way,<br />
					if an Almsman absorbs the idea of pure brilliancy,<br />
					his carnal desires are subdued,<br />
					his obduracy is banished,<br />
					his flurry and worry are educated out of him;<br />
					and these combined refinings<br />
					make that Almsman's light burn without dimness,<br />
					so that at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					he is reborn among the gods of pure brilliancy,</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt152" href="../../pali/mn/mn.127.pali.bd.htm#pg152"><span class="f2">[152]</span></a>	This,<br />
					Kaccāna,<br />
					is the cause and condition whereby,<br />
					though these deities have all alike been reborn into a single class of gods,<br />
					some are of tarnished and others of pure brilliancy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Abhiya Kaccāna said:</p>

					<p class="f4">-Good, indeed; Anuruddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">You did not say -</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard,<br />
					or thus ought it to come about;<br />
					you simply declared the facts about those deities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, you must have lived long with those deities<br />
					and had talk and converse with them!</p>

					<p class="f4">That is an offensive observation, Kaccāna;<br />
					but nevertheless I will give you your answer. -</p>

					<p class="f4">I have lived long with those deities<br />
					and have had talk and converse with them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning to the carpenter Pañcakanga,<br />
					the reverend Abhiya Kaccāna added: -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing for you, householder,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					that you have got rid of your doubts<br />
					and been privileged to hear this exposition.</p>
