					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī<br />
					in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Wanderer Uggāhamāna,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					whose mother was Samaṇa-Maṇḍikā,<br />
					was living in Queen Mallikā's <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> pleasaunce,<br />
					where the original Discussion Hall stood<br />
					among the Diospyros trees;<br />
					<a id="pt23" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg23"><span class="f2">[23]</span></a> and with Uggāhamāna<br />
					there was a great company of Wanderers<br />
					numbering some three hundred.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, Pañcakanga the carpenter had left the city in the early morning to visit the Lord,<br />
					when he bethought him that the hour was too early,<br />
					because of the Lord's private meditations<br />
					and because it was not the right time<br />
					to visit Almsmen when absorbed in thinking,<br />
					for Almsmen are given to meditation and thought.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he thought he would go and see Uggāhamāna in Queen Mallikā's pleasaunce,<br />
					and thither he repaired.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the time Uggāhamānawas sitting with his great company of Wanderers,<br />
					who were making a great noise<br />
					with their voices raised and loud<br />
					in all manner of low and beastly talk, -<br />
					about princes,<br />
					bandits,<br />
					great lords' armies,<br />
					terrors,<br />
					battles,<br />
					meats and drinks,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					relations,<br />
					villages,<br />
					townships,<br />
					cities,<br />
					countries,<br />
					women,<br />
					warriors,<br />
					roads,<br />
					wells,<br />
					kinsfolk departed,<br />
					and all the rest of it,<br />
					with chatter about world and ocean,<br />
					and about being and not-being.</p> 

					<p class="f4">When from some way off Uggāhamāna saw Pañcakanga the carpenter, coming,<br />
					he hushed his company by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Be quiet, sirs;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					here comes Pañcakanga the carpenter,<br />
					the disciple of the recluse Gotama and has been here all the time the white-robed lay disciples of Gotama<br />
					have been at Sāvatthī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These reverend men are lovers of silence<br />
					and commend the silent;<br />
					if he observes silence reigning in this gathering<br />
					he may decide to approach.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they became silent,<br />
					and the carpenter came up and,<br />
					after exchanging civil greetings with <a id="pt24" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg24"><span class="f2">[24]</span></a> Uggāhamāna,<br />
					took a seat to one side<br />
					and was addressed by the Wanderer as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In my view, carpenter,<br />
					four qualities characterize the triumphant recluse<br />
					who is imbued with the right,<br />
					who excels in the right,<br />
					and has won all that is to be won.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are these four qualities? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He does nothing evil,<br />
					he says nothing evil,<br />
					he thinks nothing evil,<br />
					and he gets his living in no evil way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are my four characteristics<br />
					of the triumphant recluse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Expressing neither satisfaction nor disagreement with this pronouncement,<br />
					Pañcakanga got up and went away<br />
					to tell the Lord,<br />
					who, being duly told, said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On Uggāhamāna's showing, carpenter,<br />
					a tiny babe on its back<br />
					is his triumphant recluse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, as yet, the babe does not know what a body means,<br />
					much less will it do evil with its body,<br />
					beyond kicking about;<br />
					it does not know what speech is,<br />
					much less will it say <a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> anything evil,<br />
					beyond crying;<br />
					it does not know what thought is,<br />
					beyond crowing with delight<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>;<br />
					it does not know what a livelihood is,<br />
					much less <a id="pt25" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg25"><span class="f2">[25]</span></a> will it get its living in an evil way,<br />
					beyond sucking its mother.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, carpenter; in my view,<br />
					these four qualities do not characterize the triumphant recluse,<br />
					but only define the tiny babe on its back.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In my view, Carpenter,<br />
					there are ten qualities<br />
					which characterize the triumphant recluse<br />
					who is imbued with the right,<br />
					excels in the right,<br />
					and has won all that is to be won.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I premise that there must be knowledge of what wrong conduct is,<br />
					how it arises,<br />
					how it is ended without leaving a vestige behind,<br />
					and how a man walks so as to end it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There must be the like knowledge<br />
					of right conduct<br />
					and of wrong <a id="pt26" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg26"><span class="f2">[26]</span></a> and right thoughts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In what now does wrong conduct consist? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In wrong actions,<br />
					wrong speech,<br />
					and an evil mode of livelihood. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these arise?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the heart is the answer. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the heart?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The heart is manifold,<br />
					complex,<br />
					and diverse,<br />
					tainted by emotions <i>(sa-citta)</i>,<br />
					passion,<br />
					ill-will,<br />
					and density. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What becomes of wrong conduct<br />
					when it ceases without leaving a vestige behind?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, when an Almsman,<br />
					discarding wrong behaviour<br />
					- of body - or of speech - or of mind -<br />
					develops the corresponding right behaviour,<br />
					and similarly discards a wicked mode of livelihood<br />
					for the right mode. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does he walk to end wrong conduct?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he brings will to bear,<br />
					puts forth endeavour and energy,<br />
					struggles and strives heartily<br />
					(i) to stop the rise of evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					(ii) to discard those<br />
					which have already arisen,<br />
					(iii) to breed right states<br />
					not yet existing, and<br />
					(iv) to stablish,<br />
					clarify,<br />
					multiply,<br />
					enlarge,<br />
					develop,<br />
					and to perfect existing good states.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt27" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg27"><span class="f2">[27]</span></a> In what does rectitude consist? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In right <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> actions,<br />
					in right speech,<br />
					and in blameless mode of livelihood. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these arise?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the heart is the answer. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the heart?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The heart is manifold,<br />
					complex,<br />
					and diverse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rectitude arises<br />
					from the heart which is void of passion,<br />
					void of ill-will,<br />
					and void of density. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What becomes of rectitude<br />
					when it ceases without leaving a vestige behind?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When an Almsman embodies virtue<br />
					and not merely virtuous observances,<br />
					by coming to know Deliverance of heart<br />
					by mind aright<br />
					so that (mere) rectitude ceases without leaving a vestige behind. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does he walk to end rectitude?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he brings will to bear,<br />
					puts forth endeavour and energy,<br />
					struggles and strives heartily<br />
					(i) to stop the rise of evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					(ii) to discard those<br />
					which have already arisen,<br />
					(iii) to breed right states<br />
					not yet existing, and<br />
					(iv) to stablish,<br />
					clarify,<br />
					multiply,<br />
					enlarge,<br />
					develop,<br />
					and to perfect existing good states.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are wrong thoughts?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are thoughts of pleasures of sense,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					and cruelty. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these arise?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From perception, is the answer. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is this perception?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is manifold,<br />
					complex,<br />
					and diverse,<br />
					divided into perceptions of pleasure,<br />
					of malevolence,<br />
					and of cruelty. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these cease without leaving a vestige behind?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, when divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					<a id="pt28" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg28"><span class="f2">[28]</span></a> an Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">How does he walk to end wrong thoughts?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he brings will to bear,<br />
					puts forth endeavour and energy,<br />
					struggles and strives heartily<br />
					(i) to stop the rise of evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					(ii) to discard those<br />
					which have already arisen,<br />
					(iii) to breed right states<br />
					not yet existing, and<br />
					(iv) to stablish,<br />
					clarify,<br />
					multiply,<br />
					enlarge,<br />
					develop,<br />
					and to perfect existing good states.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are right thoughts?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thoughts of Renunciation,<br />
					thoughts innocent of malevolence and of cruelty. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these arise?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From perception, is the answer. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is this perception? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is manifold,<br />
					complex,<br />
					and diverse,<br />
					divided into perception of Renunciation,<br />
					perception which is innocent of malevolence,<br />
					and perception which is innocent of cruelty. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do these perceptions cease without leaving a vestige behind?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, when, rising above observation and reflection,<br />
					an Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>					
					
					<p class="f4">How does he walk to end right thoughts?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he brings will to bear,<br />
					puts forth endeavour and energy,<br />
					struggles and strives heartily<br />
					(i) to stop the rise of evil and wrong states of consciousness<br />
					which have not yet arisen,<br />
					(ii) to discard those<br />
					which have already arisen,<br />
					(iii) to breed right states<br />
					not yet existing, and<br />
					(iv) to stablish,<br />
					clarify,<br />
					multiply,<br />
					enlarge,<br />
					develop,<br />
					and to perfect existing good states.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What now, carpenter, are the ten qualities<br />
					which characterize the <a id="pt29" href="../../pali/mn/mn.078.pali.bd.htm#pg29"><span class="f2">[29]</span></a> triumphant recluse<br />
					who is imbued with the right,<br />
					excels in the right,<br />
					and has won all <a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> that is to be done?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, when the Almsman is an adept<br />
					in the Noble Eightfold Path,<br />
					and in utter knowledge<br />
					and in utter Deliverance; -<br />
					<i>this</i> makes the triumphant recluse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart the carpenter Pañcakanga rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Bu. says this was a nickname given him because he 'was always learning,' his original name being Sumana (= Felix). It may be that the first part of his mother's name has been altered from Sumanā to Samaṇā (recluse), just as there  is the further tendency to read <i>-muṇḍikā</i> for the second part so as to make her name mean 'shaveling relcuse' on familiar Pali analogy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Because of its memories of the heavens which it has recently left, says Bu. in a Wordsworthian mood. (It cries, he adds, because of its memories of purgatory.)</p>
