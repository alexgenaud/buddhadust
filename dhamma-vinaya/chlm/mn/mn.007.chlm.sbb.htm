<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 7. The Buddha likens a dirty cloth incapable of taking dye to the mind corrupted by greed and covetousness, malevolence, anger, malice, hypocrisy, spite, envy, stinginess, deceit, treachery, obstinacy, impetuosity, arrogance, price and conceit — incapable of attaining a good rebirth. He then likens the cleansing of a dirty piece of cloth that renders it capable of taking dye to the process of cleansing the mind of these corruptions, and he describes this cleansing process." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Fulling. Perhaps the fuller also acts as the dyer, but fulling propper is the thickening of wool by various processes (heat, water, pressure) that make it felt-like.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">"Even as a foul and dirty piece of cloth,<br />
					if dipped by the fuller in blue,<br />
					yellow,<br />
					red,<br />
					or pink dye,<br />
					would take the dye badly<br />
					and not come out a good colour,<br />
					and that because of the cloth's impurity, -<br />
					even so, Brethren, when a man's heart is impure,<br />
					woe must be expected to ensue;<br />
					and, conversely,<br />
					just as cloth in the fuller's hands<br />
					takes the dye well<br />
					if it be pure and clean,<br />
					so, when a man's heart is pure,<br />
					bliss may be expected to ensue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what are the heart's impurities?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are avarice and covetise,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					anger,<br />
					malice,<br />
					rivalry,<br />
					jealousy,<br />
					grudging,<br />
					envy,<br />
					hypocrisy,<br />
					deceit,<br />
					imperviousness,<br />
					outcry,<br />
					pride,<br />
					arrogance,<br />
					inflation,<br />
					and indolence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognizing that each in turn of these is an impurity of the heart,<br />
					an Almsman puts them from him;<br />
					and when at last he has put them all from him,<br />
					he comes to full belief in the Enlightened One and to recognition of him as the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment;<br />
					he comes to full belief in the Doctrine<br />
					and to recognition of it<br />
					as having been excellently expounded by the Lord,<br />
					as being here and now and immediate,<br />
					with a welcome to all<br />
					and with salvation for all,<br />
					to be comprehended of each man of understanding;<br />
					he comes to belief in the Lord's Confraternity<br />
					and to recognition of it<br />
					as schooled aright<br />
					and as walking uprightly,<br />
					trained in all propriety and in duty,<br />
					the Brotherhood of the conversion<br />
					with its four pairs<br />
					making up the eight classes of the converted,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					right <a id="pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span></a> worthy to receive alms,<br />
					hospitality,<br />
					oblations<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					unrivalled throughout the world<br />
					as the field for garnering merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the uttermost,<br />
					every form of self-seeking is renounced,<br />
					spewed out,<br />
					discharged,<br />
					discarded<br />
					and abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing that he has come to full belief in the Enlightened One -<br />
					and in his Doctrine -<br />
					and in his Confraternity, -<br />
					the Brother reaches fruition of spiritual welfare<br />
					and of its causes<br />
					together with the gladness attendant thereon;<br />
					from such gladness is born zest,<br />
					bringing tranquillity to the body;<br />
					with his body now tranquil,<br />
					he experiences satisfaction,<br />
					wherein he finds peace for his heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman who has reached this pitch in virtue,<br />
					character<br />
					and lore,<br />
					may, without harm or hurt,<br />
					indulge in the choicest rice<br />
					with all manner of sauces and curries.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a foul and filthy cloth,<br />
					if plunged in clear water,<br />
					becomes pure and clean;<br />
					and just as silver,<br />
					if passed through the furnace,<br />
					becomes pure and clean; -<br />
					even so can such an Almsman eat as he will<br />
					without harm or hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">With radiant thoughts of love -<br />
					of compassion -<br />
					of sympathy -<br />
					and of poise -<br />
					his mind pervades each of the world's four quarters, -<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					across,<br />
					everywhere;<br />
					the whole length and breadth of the wide world<br />
					is pervaded by the radiant thoughts<br />
					of a mind all-embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					and boundless,<br />
					in which no hate dwells<br />
					nor ill-will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus much is so,<br />
					says he to himself;<br />
					there is a lower<br />
					and there is yet a higher stage;<br />
					Deliverance<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> lies beyond this realm of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this,<br />
					his heart is delivered from the Cankers of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					of continuing existence,<br />
					of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus Delivered<br />
					comes knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth <a id="pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span></a> is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					there is now no more of what I have been.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx60 marl6">
							<p>Inly. Inwardly.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">- Such an Almsman is said to be inly washen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at this time there was sitting close by<br />
					the brahmin Sundarika-Bhāradvāja<br />
					who asked whether the Lord went to the river Bāhukā to bathe.</p>

					<p class="f4">What boots the river Bāhukā, brahmin?</p>

					<p class="f4">What can it do?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is reputed to cleanse<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and give merit;<br />
					many have their burthen of evil borne away in its waters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, the Lord addressed the brahmin in these lines:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">In Bāhukā,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> at Adhikākka's ghāt,<br />
							Gayā, Sundārikā, Sarāssatī,<br />
							Bāhumatī, Payāga, - there the fool<br />
							may bathe and bathe, yet never Cleanse his Heart.<br />
							Of what avail are all these ghats and streams?<br />
							- They cleanse not heart or hand of guilt.<br />
							For him whose heart is Cleansed, each day is blest,<br />
							each day is hallowed; pure of heart and mind,<br />
							he hallows each new day with vows renewed.<br />
							So hither, brahmin, come and Bathe as I:<br />
							Love all that lives, speak truth, slay not nor steal,<br />
							no niggard be but dwell in faith, and then -<br />
							why seek Gayā? - Your well at home's Gayā!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon the brahmin said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, Gotama; excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness so that those with eyes to see might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his <a id="pg29"><span class="f2 g"><b>[29]</b></span></a> Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask him to admit me as a Pilgrim in his train and to confirm me therein!</p>

					<p class="f4">Admitted and confirmed accordingly,<br />
					the reverend Bhāradvāja was not long before,<br />
					dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					he won the prize in quest of which young men<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> go forth from home to homelessness as Pilgrims,<br />
					that prize of prizes which crowns the highest life, -<br />
					even this did he think out and realize for himself,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					here and now;<br />
					and to him came the conviction that for him rebirth was now no more;<br />
					that he had lived the highest life;<br />
					that his task was done;<br />
					and that now for him there was no more of what he had been.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the reverend Bhāradvāja too was numbered among the Arahats.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Confraternity-which, of course, does not include the laity - is here divided into eight classes, each of the Four Paths in conversion being subdivided into entrants and adepts (<i>magga</i> and <i>phala</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Bu.</i> interprets these four stages as the recognition successively of the Four Noble Truths. In a separate category, extirpation of the Cankers - for the Arahat here, as for the Buddha himself in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p4">Sutta No. 4</a> - precedes triumphant Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Reading <i>1okhyas,</i>&deg; with <i>Bu.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Bu.</i>  remarks that, while Bāhukā, Sundārikā, Sarāssatī, and Bāhumatī are rivers, the rest are <i>titthas</i> only, or ghāts, on the Ganges.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>The brahminical idea came second! First comes noble behavior and action, then comes the description of such as "nobility."</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>Kulaputtā</i> (translated sts. as clansmen) are of two kinds, according to <i>Bu.</i> - scions of noble families and those who behave and act as such. The latter are doubtless grafted on to the earlier brahminical idea.</p>
