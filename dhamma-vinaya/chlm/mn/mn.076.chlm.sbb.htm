					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosambi">Kosambī</a><br />
					in the Ghosita pleasaunce,<br />
					the Wanderer Sandaka was living at Pilakkha-guhā<br />
					with a great company of Wanderers,<br />
					some five hundred in number.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising from his meditations towards evening,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda proposed to the Almsmen<br />
					to go to Deva-Kaṭa Pool<br />
					to visit the cavern.</p>

					<p class="f4">They agreeing, Ānanda took a number of them there with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Sandaka was sitting with his great company of Wanderers,<br />
					who were making a great noise<br />
					with their voices raised and loud<br />
					in all manner of low and beastly talk, -<br />
					about princes,<br />
					bandits,<br />
					great lords' armies,<br />
					terrors,<br />
					battles,<br />
					meats and drinks,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					relations,<br />
					villages,<br />
					<a id="pg363"><span class="f2 g"><b>[363]</b></span></a> townships,<br />
					cities,<br />
					countries,<br />
					women,<br />
					warriors,<br />
					roads,<br />
					wells,<br />
					kinsfolk departed,<br />
					and all the rest of it,<br />
					with chatter about world and ocean,<br />
					and <a id="pt514" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg514"><span class="f2">[514]</span></a> about being and not-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">When from some way off Sandaka saw Ānanda coming,<br />
					he hushed his company by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Be quiet, sirs;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					here comes the recluse Ānanda,<br />
					the disciple of the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">All the time disciples of Gotama have been staying at the Kosambī,<br />
					Ānanda has been one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">These recluses are lovers of quiet,<br />
					are trained to quiet,<br />
					and commend the quiet;<br />
					if he observes quiet reigning in this gathering,<br />
					he may decide to approach.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they became quiet,<br />
					and Ānanda came up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Sandaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">I beg the reverend Ānanda to join us;<br />
					he is truly welcome;<br />
					it is a long time since last he managed to get here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray be seated;<br />
					here is a seat for your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda sat down accordingly,<br />
					asking Sandaka, who took a low seat to one side,<br />
					what had been their theme<br />
					and what was the discussion<br />
					which had been interrupted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let that pass for the moment, answered Sandaka;<br />
					you can easily gather that later on.</p>

					<p class="f4">What I should like,<br />
					would be if you would think of some discourse<br />
					on your own teacher's tenets.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, Sandaka, listen and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly, answered Sandaka;<br />
					and Ānanda began:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has specified four antitheses to the higher life,<br />
					and four comfortless vocations,<br />
					wherein a man of intelligence<br />
					will assuredly not follow the higher life,<br />
					or, if he does follow it there,<br />
					will not advance to knowledge,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the four antitheses, Ãnanda?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt515" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg515"><span class="f2">[515]</span></a>	First,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> there is the teacher who affirms and holds<br />
					that there is no such thing as alms,<br />
					or sacrifice,<br />
					or oblations;<br />
					no such things as the fruit and harvest of <a id="pg364"><span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span></a> deeds good or bad;<br />
					no such thing as this world or the next;<br />
					no such thing as parents,<br />
					or beings translated to another sphere;<br />
					no such thing in this world<br />
					as a recluse or brahmin who has triumphantly walked aright,<br />
					so that, of and by himself,<br />
					he has comprehended this world and the next<br />
					and makes them known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man - he avers - is composed of the four Elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">At his death the earth resumes and absorbs his earthy elements,<br />
					water his watery elements,<br />
					fire his fiery elements,<br />
					and space his faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">A bier and four bearers<br />
					go off with the dead man,<br />
					whose remains are visible as far as the charnel-ground<br />
					where his bones whiten and bleach.</p>

					<p class="f4">Oblations are words and nothing more;<br />
					alms-giving is nonsense; -<br />
					it is a sham and a lie and idle chatter<br />
					to assert the contrary.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution<br />
					sages and fools alike<br />
					are cut off and perish,<br />
					without any future after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this pronouncement awakens the following reflections:</p>

					<p class="f4">If all this teacher says is true,<br />
					then, without my doing a stroke,<br />
					my task is done,<br />
					and I have lived the higher life<br />
					without essaying it at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pair of us are on precisely the same level of recluse-ship, -<br />
					though for my part I do not aver<br />
					that at the body's dissolution<br />
					we shall both be cut off and perish,<br />
					with no future after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is all supererogation for this reverend teacher to go naked,<br />
					to shave his head,<br />
					to hop about a-squat,<br />
					and to pluck out his hair and beard by the roots;<br />
					while I, - living with a host of sons around me,<br />
					revelling in sandal from Kasi,<br />
					decked out with garlands and scents and perfumes,<br />
					not refusing gold and silver -<br />
					shall yet fare hereafter<br />
					no whit worse than he.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do I see or know in this teacher<br />
					that I should follow the higher life under him?</p>

					<p class="f4">And, when it is recognized<br />
					that this is an antithesis to the higher life,<br />
					off goes the man in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the first antithesis to the higher life,<br />
					as specified by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt516" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg516"><span class="f2">[516]</span></a>	Secondly, there is the teacher who affirms and holds<br />
					that no evil is done by him<br />
					who either acts himself<br />
					or causes another to act,<br />
					who mutilates<br />
					or causes <a id="pg365"><span class="f2 g"><b>[365]</b></span></a> another to mutilate,<br />
					who punishes<br />
					or causes another to punish,<br />
					who is the author of grief or torment or terror,<br />
					or causes another to terrify,<br />
					who takes life, steals, is a burglar, robber, house-breaker, footpad, adulterer or liar.</p>

					<p class="f4">If with a cleaver<br />
					as sharp as a razor<br />
					he were to slay earth's living creatures<br />
					and pile up their corpses in a single heap and mound of flesh,<br />
					no guilt proceeds<br />
					and no result of guilt ensues.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he were to make his way up to the southern bank of the Ganges<br />
					killing and wounding,<br />
					maiming and causing to be maimed,<br />
					punishing and causing to be punished, -<br />
					no guilt proceeds<br />
					nor any result of guilt ensue.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he were to make his way up to the northern bank of the Ganges<br />
					distributing alms<br />
					and causing alms to be distributed,<br />
					offering sacrifices<br />
					and causing sacrifices to be offered, -<br />
					no virtue proceeds<br />
					and no result of virtue ensues.</p>

					<p class="f4">No merit proceeds<br />
					nor does any result of virtue ensue<br />
					from alms-giving<br />
					or temperance<br />
					or self-control or truthfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this pronouncement awakens the following reflections:</p>

					<p class="f4">If all this teacher says is true,<br />
					then, without my doing a stroke,<br />
					my task is done,<br />
					and I have lived the higher life<br />
					without essaying it at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pair of us<br />
					are on precisely the same level of recluse-ship, -<br />
					though for my part<br />
					I do not aver<br />
					that the actions of the two of us work no evil.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is all supererogation ...<br />
					off goes the man in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the second antithesis to the higher life,<br />
					as specified by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thirdly, there is the teacher<br />
					who affirms and holds<br />
					that there is no cause or reason<br />
					for either depravity or purity; -<br />
					it is without either cause or reason<br />
					that some are depraved and some pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no such thing as intrinsic strength<br />
					or energy<br />
					or human <a id="pt517" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg517"><span class="f2">[517]</span></a> might<br />
					or human endeavour.</p>

					<p class="f4">All creatures,<br />
					all living things,<br />
					all beings,<br />
					all that has life, -<br />
					all are devoid of power, strength and energy;<br />
					all are under the compulsion<br />
					of the individual nature<br />
					to which they are linked by destiny;<br />
					and it is solely by virtue<br />
					of what they are born as<br />
					in the six environments<br />
					that they experience their pleasure or pain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg366"><span class="f2 g"><b>[366]</b></span></a> In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this pronouncement awakens the following reflections:</p>

					<p class="f4">If all this teacher says is true,<br />
					then, without my doing a stroke,<br />
					my task is done,<br />
					and I have lived the higher life<br />
					without essaying it at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pair of us are on precisely the same level of recluse-ship, -<br />
					though for my part<br />
					I do not aver<br />
					that both of us will become pure without cause or reason.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is all supererogation ...<br />
					off goes the man in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the third antithesis to the higher life,<br />
					as specified by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, there is the teacher<br />
					who affirms and holds that,<br />
					there are seven substances<br />
					which are neither made<br />
					nor commanded to be made,<br />
					neither created<br />
					nor commanded to be created,<br />
					engendering nothing,<br />
					immovable as mountain-peaks or massive columns;<br />
					they neither budge nor change;<br />
					they neither molest one another<br />
					nor can they impart to one another<br />
					either pleasure or pain or both.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven substances are earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					pleasure,<br />
					pain,<br />
					and life.</p>

					<p class="f4">With them there is neither killer nor slayer,<br />
					neither teller nor told,<br />
					neither teacher nor taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					who with a keen blade<br />
					chops a head in twain,<br />
					thereby robs anyone of life;<br />
					all that happens<br />
					is that in its descent<br />
					the blade has opened up a passage<br />
					between just these seven substances.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />

					and I have lived the higher life<br />
					without essaying it at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pair of us are on precisely the same level of recluse-ship, -<br />
					though for my part<br />
					I do not aver that the pair of us<br />
					have only to transmigrate in order to end Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is all supererogation ...<br />
					off goes the man in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the fourth antithesis to the higher life,<br />
					as specified by the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg368"><span class="f2 g"><b>[368]</b></span></a> <a id="pt519" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg519"><span class="f2">[519]</span></a> Wonderful, Ānanda,<br />
					marvellous,<br />
					how the Lord has specified these four antitheses.</p>

					<p class="f4">What now are those four comfortless vocations he speaks of?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a teacher<br />
					who is 'all-knowing and all-seeing,<br />
					with nothing outside his ken and vision,<br />
					who claims that,<br />
					whether he is walking or standing still,<br />
					whether he is asleep or awake,<br />
					his ken and vision stand ready,<br />
					aye ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This teacher goes to a house which is empty<br />
					and gets no alms given him;<br />
					is bitten by a dog;<br />
					encounters a violent elephant or horse or bullock;<br />
					asks a man or woman their name and clan;<br />
					or needs to ask the name of,<br />
					or the way to,<br />
					a village or township.</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked how he explains this,<br />
					he answers that he had to do each of these things<br />
					and was constrained to do as he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this pronouncement awakens the following reflections:</p>

					<p class="f4">All-knowing and all-seeing though he is,<br />
					this reverend teacher yet does all these things and must!</p>

					<p class="f4">So, observing this to be a comfortless form of the higher life,<br />
					off he goes in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Sandaka, is the first comfortless vocation<br />
					which the Lord who knows and sees,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					has indicated as one <a id="pt520" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg520"><span class="f2">[520]</span></a><br />
					wherein a man of intelligence<br />
					will not follow the higher life,<br />
					or, if he does follow it,<br />
					will not advance to knowledge,<br />
					the doctrine,<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, there is the teacher<br />
					who derives from tradition<br />
					and holds by traditional truth,<br />
					preaching a doctrine which is traditional,<br />
					which has been handed down the line,<br />
					and is scriptural.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now traditional orthodoxy is partly sound<br />
					and partly unsound,<br />
					right here<br />
					and wrong there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this awakens the reflections<br />
					that it is all hearsay,<br />
					and a comfortless vocation;<br />
					and off he goes in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the second comfortless vocation<br />
					indicated by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next there is the teacher<br />
					who is a rationalist of pure reason and criticism,<br />
					preaching a doctrine of his own <a id="pg369"><span class="f2 g"><b>[369]</b></span></a> devising<br />
					evolved for him by his own reasoning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now your rationalist teacher reasons sometimes well<br />
					and sometimes badly,<br />
					being right here<br />
					and wrong there.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this awakens the reflection<br />
					that it is individual speculation,<br />
					partly right and partly wrong,<br />
					and a comfortless vocation;<br />
					and off he goes in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the third comfortless vocation<br />
					indicated by the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, there is the teacher<br />
					who is stupid and deficient,<br />
					so that he <a id="pt521" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg521"><span class="f2">[521]</span></a> meets this or that question<br />
					by equivocation and tortuosity, - saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not affirm this,<br />
					I do not affirm that,<br />
					I do not affirm otherwise,<br />
					I do not affirm the negative,<br />
					nor do I deny the negative.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a hearer of intelligence,<br />
					this awakens the reflections<br />
					that the teacher is stupid and deficient,<br />
					that he is sitting on the fence,<br />
					that this is a comfortless vocation;<br />
					and so off he goes in disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the fourth of the comfortless vocations<br />
					indicated by the Lord<br />
					who knows and sees,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					as those wherein a man of intelligence<br />
					will assuredly not follow the higher life,<br />
					or, if he does follow it there,<br />
					will not advance to knowledge,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful and marvellous, Ānanda,<br />
					how the Lord has exposed the futility<br />
					of these four comfortless vocations.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me now his own gospel of the higher life<br />
					and of the advance to knowledge,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">There appears in the world here, Sandaka, a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened -<br />
					and so forth as in the <a href="mn.051.chlm.sbb.htm">Kandaraka Sutta (No. 51)</a> -<br />
					dwells in the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction,<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Under whatever teacher a disciple attains to this degree of excellence,<br />
					<a id="pt522" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg522"><span class="f2">[522]</span></a> there indeed will a man of intelligence<br />
					follow the higher life,<br />
					and, if he does,<br />
					there will he advance to knowledge,<br />
					to the Doctrine<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg370"><span class="f2 g"><b>[370]</b></span></a> And so too in succession<br />
					with the Second,<br />
					Third<br />
					and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stedfast and immutable, -<br />
					it is thus that he now applies his heart<br />
					to the knowledge of recalling his former existences;<br />
					he calls to mind his divers existences in the past ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>) ... in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">Under whatever teacher ...<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to the knowledge of the passing hence,<br />
					and the reappearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>) ...<br />
					states of happiness in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Under whatever teacher ...<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to the knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know as what they really are -<br />
					Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the path which leads to the cessation of Ill;<br />
					he comes to know for what they really are -<br />
					Cankers,<br />
					the origin of Cankers,<br />
					the cessation of Cankers,<br />
					and the path which leads to the cessation of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this,<br />
					his heart is delivered from the Canker of lusts,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker Of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus Delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction that -</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more<br />
					of what I have been!</p>

					<p class="f4">At the feet of whatever teacher<br />
					a disciple attains to this degree of excellence,<br />
					there indeed will a man of intelligence follow the higher life,<br />
					and, if he does,<br />
					there will he advance to knowledge,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and what is right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would the Almsman, Ānanda,<br />
					who is an Arahat -<br />
					in whom Cankers are dead,<br />
					who has greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who has cast off his burthen,<br />
					who has won his weal,<br />
					whose bonds are no more,<br />
					and who by utter knowledge<br />
					has been entirely Delivered -,<br />
					would he <a id="pt523" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg523"><span class="f2">[523]</span></a> indulge in pleasures of sense?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg371"><span class="f2 g"><b>[371]</b></span></a> There are five things, Sandaka,<br />
					which the Arahat of entire Deliverance<br />
					is incapable of having truck with; -<br />
					he is incapable of taking life wittingly,<br />
					of stealing,<br />
					of fornication,<br />
					of deliberate lying,<br />
					or of revelling in pleasures of sense<br />
					as in the days when he still had a home.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Almsman of Entire Deliverance -<br />
					whether he is walking or standing still,<br />
					asleep or awake -<br />
					is his ken and vision ready,<br />
					aye ready,<br />
					to assure him<br />
					that his Cankers are extirpated?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will give you an illustration, -<br />
					which often helps a man of intelligence to comprehend.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man whose hands and feet have been cut off;<br />
					whether walking or standing still,<br />
					whether asleep or awake,<br />
					his hands and feet remain always off, -<br />
					as observation assures him.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same<br />
					with that Arahat of Entire Deliverance;<br />
					whether walking or standing still,<br />
					whether asleep or awake,<br />
					his Cankers remain always extirpated, -<br />
					as observation assures him.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many such shining lights<br />
					are there in this Doctrine and Rule, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a mere hundred;<br />
					not two,<br />
					three,<br />
					four<br />
					or five hundreds;<br />
					we have many more of them than that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful and marvellous, Ānanda!</p>

					<p class="f4">And therewithal<br />
					no extolling of fellow-believers,<br />
					no disparaging of non-believers!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the scope of the teaching but be example enough, <a id="pt524" href="../../pali/mn/mn.076.pali.bd.htm#pg524"><span class="f2">[524]</span></a><br />
					and there will appear many a shining light!</p>

					<p class="f4">As for these Mendicants,<br />
					they are children of a childless mother;<br />
					they extol themselves<br />
					and disparage others,<br />
					yet have only produced three shining lights,<br />
					to wit Nanda Vaccha,<br />
					Kisa Sankicca,<br />
					and Makkhali Gosāla.</p>

					<p class="f4">Addressing then his own following, Sandaka said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, sirs;<br />
					our higher life is with the recluse Gotama,<br />
					though it is no light matter<br />
					for us to abandon presents,<br />
					repute<br />
					and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">With these words<br />
					the Wanderer Sandaka counselled his followers<br />
					to lead the higher life with the Lord.</p>
