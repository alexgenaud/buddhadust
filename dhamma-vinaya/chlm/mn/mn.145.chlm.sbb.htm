					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Puṇṇa,<br />
					rising at eventide from his meditations,<br />
					came to the Lord and,<br />
					when seated after due salutations,<br />
					asked the Lord to teach him concisely how,<br />
					having listened to the Lord's Doctrine,<br />
					he should live alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent and purged of self.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Listen then, Puṇṇa,<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then to the attentive Puṇṇa the Lord began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are forms of which sight is conscious,<br />
					sounds of which the hearing is conscious,<br />
					odours of which smell is conscious,<br />
					savours of which taste is conscious,<br />
					impressions of which touch is conscious,<br />
					and mental objects of which the mind is conscious, -<br />
					all of them desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant<br />
					and attractive,<br />
					all of them bound up with lusts<br />
					and exciting to passion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If an Almsman hails<br />
					and welcomes any of these<br />
					and cleaves to them,<br />
					delight will thus arise in him;<br />
					and from the beginning of delight, say I,<br />
					comes the beginning of Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if he does not hail<br />
					and welcome<br />
					and cleave to them,<br />
					delight will thus cease in him;<br />
					and from the cessation of delight, say I,<br />
					comes the cessation of Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt268" href="../../pali/mn/mn.145.pali.bd.htm#pg268"><span class="f2">[268]</span></a> With this concise teaching from me, Puṇṇa,<br />
					in what country will you take up your abode.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In Sunāparanta, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are a fierce and violent race, Puṇṇa,<br />
					in Sunāparanta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If they were to abuse and revile you there,<br />
					what would you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg308"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span></a> I should think, Lord,<br />
					that the good folk of Sunāparanta<br />
					were really nice people,<br />
					very nice people indeed,<br />
					in that they forbore to strike me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if they did strike you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I should think, Lord,<br />
					... forbore to pelt me with clods.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if they did pelt you with clods?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I should think, Lord,<br />
					... forbore to cudgel me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt269" href="../../pali/mn/mn.145.pali.bd.htm#pg269"><span class="f2">[269]</span></a>	But if they did cudgel you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I should think, Lord,<br />
					... forbore to knife me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if they did knife you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I should think, Lord,<br />
					... forbore to take my life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if they did take your life?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If they did, Lord,<br />
					I should think that there are disciples of the Lord<br />
					who, in their tribulation and despair,<br />
					are on the look-out for someone with a knife,<br />
					and that I have found him<br />
					without having to hunt about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what I should think, Lord;<br />
					that would be my thought, Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Good indeed, Puṇṇa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With such a command of yourself,<br />
					you will be able to live with the folk of Sunāparanta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With grateful thanks to the LordSunaparantafor what he had said,<br />
					the reverend Puṇṇa rose,<br />
					took his leave of the Lord with deep reverence,<br />
					and, after putting his bedding away properly,<br />
					departed, bowl in hand and duly robed,<br />
					to beg his way to the Sunāparanta country,<br />
					to which in due course he came<br />
					and there dwelt.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Before the close of his very first rainy season,<br />
					Puṇṇa had gathered round him<br />
					five hundred disciples of each sex,<br />
					and had realized the Three Knowledges.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Time came when the reverend Puṇṇa passed away,<br />
					and the Almsmen came to the Lord<br />
					to ask <a id="pt270" href="../../pali/mn/mn.145.pali.bd.htm#pg270"><span class="f2">[270]</span></a> what future awaited him<br />
					and what his destiny would be.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Instructed, Almsmen, was the young man Puṇṇa;<br />
					he readily embraced the Doctrine<br />
					and its corollaries;<br />
					he gave me no trouble doctrinally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has passed to Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
