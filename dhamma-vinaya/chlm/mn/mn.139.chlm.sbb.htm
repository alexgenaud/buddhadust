					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he announced to the Almsmen that he would expound to them the detailed exposition of Calm,<br />
					and thus began: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let a man neither give himself over<br />
					to pleasures of sense -<br />
					which are low,<br />
					pagan,<br />
					vulgar,<br />
					ignoble<br />
					and unprofitable -<br />
					nor yet let him give himself over<br />
					to self-mortification, -<br />
					which is painful,<br />
					ignoble<br />
					and unprofitable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To the exclusion of both these extremes,<br />
					the Truth-finder has discovered a middle course<br />
					which gives vision and understanding,<br />
					and conduces to tranquillity,<br />
					insight,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let him understand both appreciation<br />
					and depreciation,<br />
					and, having understood them,<br />
					let him not appreciate or depreciate<br />
					but preach the Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let him understand the appraisement of ease;<br />
					and, having understood it,<br />
					let him pursue inward ease of heart.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let him not be a tale-teller<br />
					nor confront anyone<br />
					with improper remarks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Slowly let him speak,<br />
					not hurriedly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let him neither affect provincialisms in speech<br />
					nor depart from recognized parlance. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the summary of the exposition of calm.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">I said that a man was to avoid both extremes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, in the one case,<br />
					the low, pagan, vulgar, ignoble and unprofitable<br />
					pursuit of pleasures of sense<br />
					and their delights,<br />
					being fraught with Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and distress,<br />
					is the wrong course, -<br />
					the right course being <a id="pt231" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg231"><span class="f2">[231]</span></a> to eschew<br />
					the pursuit of pleasure<br />
					and to escape its consequences;<br />
					and because, in the second case,<br />
					painful, ignoble and unprofitable self-mortification,<br />
					being fraught with Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and distress,<br />
					is the wrong course,- <a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> the right course being to eschew<br />
					self-mortification<br />
					and to escape its consequences.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I said that,<br />
					to the exclusion of both these extremes,<br />
					the Truth-finder had discovered a middle course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the Noble Eightfold Path, - namely,<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right endeavour,<br />
					right mindfulness and<br />
					right rapture of concentration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I said that a man should understand<br />
					appreciation and depreciation<br />
					and neither appreciate nor depreciate<br />
					but preach the Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How do appreciation and depreciation come about<br />
					without preaching the Doctrine? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, when a man says<br />
					that all those persons who are devoted to the low<br />
					... and unprofitable pursuit<br />
					of pleasures of sense and their delights,<br />
					are all of them fraught with Ill, hurt, tribulation and distress<br />
					and all on the wrong course, -<br />
					then he is depreciating a class of individuals;<br />
					while he is appreciating another class of individuals<br />
					when he says that all those persons who eschew<br />
					the pursuit of such pleasures of sense and their delights,<br />
					are all of them without Ill, hurt tribulation and distress,<br />
					and are all on the right course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So too when he says<br />
					that all those persons who are devoted<br />
					to painful ignoble and unprofitable self-mortification,<br />
					are all of them,<br />
					<a id="pt232" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg232"><span class="f2">[232]</span></a> fraught with Ill ... distress<br />
					and are all of them on the wrong course, -<br />
					then he is depreciating a class of individuals;<br />
					while he is appreciating another class of individuals<br />
					when he says that all who eschew self-mortification<br />
					are all of them without Ill, hurt, tribulation and distress,<br />
					and are all on the right course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So too when he says the same of individuals<br />
					who either have not,<br />
					or have,<br />
					got rid of the bonds<br />
					that tie them to continued existence,<br />
					it is a class of individuals<br />
					that he is either depreciating or appreciating,<br />
					without teaching the Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, now, without appreciation or depreciation<br />
					is the Doctrine preached? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By not making any such statements<br />
					as the foregoing (about particular classes of individuals),<br />
					but by teaching the truth<br />
					in (abstract terms of general principle,<br />
					such as): -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Devotion to this <a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> is fraught<br />
					with Ill, hurt, tribulation and distress,<br />
					and is a wrong course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or Non-devotion to this<br />
					is without Ill ... and distress,<br />
					and is a right course.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt288" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg288"><span class="f2">[288]</span></a>	I said that a man should understand the appraisement of ease<br />
					but pursue inward ease of heart.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Five strands make up pleasures of sense, -<br />
					forms,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					savours,<br />
					and things touched, -<br />
					all of them desirable,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					pleasant and attractive,<br />
					all of them bound up with lusts<br />
					and exciting passion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The easefulness which is bred of these five<br />
					is called the sensual,<br />
					foul<br />
					and ignoble ease<br />
					of the everyday man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I lay it down<br />
					that there must be no fostering<br />
					or growth<br />
					or development<br />
					of such ease,<br />
					but a dread of it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take now the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, divested of lusts and wrong dispositions,<br />
					develops in succession the Four Ecstasies.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This it is<br />
					which is called the heart's ease of Renunciation,<br />
					aloofness,<br />
					tranquillity<br />
					and Enlightenment, -<br />
					of which there should be fostering,<br />
					growth<br />
					and development,<br />
					without any dread at all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt234" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg234"><span class="f2">[234]</span></a> I said that a man should not be a tale-teller<br />
					nor confront anyone with improper remarks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he knows that the tale<br />
					is false and untrue and unprofitable,<br />
					assuredly he should not tell it;<br />
					also, he should study not to report<br />
					what, though true and not false,<br />
					is yet unprofitable;<br />
					but he should - at a seasonable juncture -<br />
					tell what he knows to be<br />
					not only true but also profitable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Precisely the same applies also<br />
					to making improper remarks to anyone.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I said that he should speak slowly<br />
					and not hurriedly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because the hurried speaker's body becomes distressed,<br />
					his mind becomes worn out,<br />
					his voice becomes worn out,<br />
					and his throat suffers,<br />
					while his speech grows incoherent and unintelligible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But none of these results attend a slow and measured utterance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I said that a man should neither affect provincialisms in speech<br />
					nor depart from recognized parlance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In various provinces the same bowl is styled <i>pāti,</i> <a id="pt285" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg285"><span class="f2">[285]</span></a>	<i>patta,<br />
					vittha,<br />
					sarāva,<br />
					dhāropa,<br />
					poṇa</i><br />
					and <i>pisīla;</i><br />
					and it is with obstinacy<br />
					tenacity<br />
					and pertinacity<br />
					that each particular province<br />
					insists that theirs is the only <a id="pg289"><span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span></a> right word,<br />
					all others being wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The proper thing is<br />
					frankly to use in each particular province<br />
					the word they understand.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, Almsmen, the pleasure-lover's low,<br />
					pagan,<br />
					vulgar,<br />
					ignoble<br />
					and unprofitable<br />
					pursuit of delight,<br />
					is fraught with Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and distress<br />
					and is the wrong course;<br />
					and that is why it is not attended by calm;<br />
					whereas to eschew such pursuit<br />
					is to escape Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and distress<br />
					and is the right course;<br />
					and that is why calm attends it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The same applies to indulgence in self-mortification<br />
					and to eschewing it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt236" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg236"><span class="f2">[236]</span></a> The middle course discovered by the Truth-finder -<br />
					which gives vision and understanding<br />
					and conduces to tranquillity,<br />
					insight,<br />
					Enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana -<br />
					is void of Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation,<br />
					or distress,<br />
					and is the right course;<br />
					and that is why it gives calm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Appreciation and depreciation,<br />
					without preaching the Doctrine,<br />
					are fraught with Ill,<br />
					hurt,<br />
					tribulation<br />
					and distress,<br />
					and are the wrong course;<br />
					and that is why no calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But, when the Doctrine is preached<br />
					without either appreciation or depreciation,<br />
					this is without Ill ...<br />
					calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The sensual, foul and ignoble ease<br />
					of the everyday man<br />
					is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the heart's ease of Renunciation,<br />
					aloofness and tranquillity is without Ill<br />
					... calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When tale-telling is false,<br />
					untrue and unprofitable,<br />
					it is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the thing told,<br />
					though true and not false,<br />
					is yet unprofitable,<br />
					it is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But where the thing told is not only true but also profitable,<br />
					it is without Ill ...<br />
					calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To confront anyone with improper remarks that are false and untrue and unprofitable,<br />
					is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent;<br />
					as it is also if the remarks though true and not false are yet unprofitable;<br />
					but if <a id="pt287" href="../../pali/mn/mn.139.pali.bd.htm#pg287"><span class="f2">[287]</span></a> they be both true and profitable,<br />
					then it is without Ill ...<br />
					calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hurried speaking is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent;<br />
					but a slow and measured utterance is without III ...<br />
					calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To affect pro- <a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> vincialisms in speech and to depart from the recognized parlance is fraught with Ill ...<br />
					calm is absent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither to affect provincialism in speech nor to depart from recognized parlance is without Ill ...<br />
					calm is present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, Almsmen,<br />
					train yourselves to understand calm and turmoil,<br />
					and, understanding them,<br />
					to walk where calm dwells.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The young man Subhūti walks where calm dwells.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
