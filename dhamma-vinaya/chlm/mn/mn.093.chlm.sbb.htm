					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					some five hundred brahmins<br />
					from divers countries<br />
					were stopping in the city<br />
					on some business or other.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought they: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here is this recluse Gotama<br />
					preaching that purity extends<br />
					to all four classes alike.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who can refute him?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now in the city at the time<br />
					there was a young brahmin named Assalāyana,<br />
					a youth of sixteen,<br />
					with shaven head,<br />
					who was versed in all three Vedas,<br />
					was accomplished in ritual<br />
					with the glosses thereon,<br />
					in phonology,<br />
					and in etymology,<br />
					with chronicles as a fifth branch;<br />
					he knew exegesis,<br />
					and was learned in casuistry<br />
					and in the signs that mark a Superman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is he,<br />
					thought those brahmins,<br />
					who can refute the recluse Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they asked him to essay the task;<br />
					but he replied that Gotama was a thinker<br />
					with a Doctrine of his own<br />
					and that thinkers with Doctrines of their own<br />
					were awkward people to refute;<br />
					nor could he personally refute Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time they appealed to Assalāyana,<br />
					<a id="pt148" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg148"><span class="f2">[148]</span></a> reminding him that he had been a Wanderer;<br />
					but he returned the same answer as before.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A third time the brahmins appealed to him,<br />
					adding that he ought not to own defeat without a contest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And this time Assalāyana answered<br />
					that he did not share their view,<br />
					that Gotama was a thinker with a Doctrine of his own,<br />
					that such independent thinkers were awkward people to refute,<br />
					and that he personally could not tackle Gotama, -<br />
					but that, at their bidding,<br />
					he would go forward.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So, escorted by a numerous company of brahmins,<br />
					the young brahmin Assalāyana went to the Lord,<br />
					and, after exchange of greetings,<br />
					sat down to one side, saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Brahmins maintain, Gotama,<br />
					that only brah- <a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> mins form the superior class,<br />
					all other classes being inferior;<br />
					that only brahmins form the white class,<br />
					all other classes being black fellows;<br />
					that purity resides in brahmins alone<br />
					and not in non-brahmins;<br />
					and that only brahmins are Brahmā's legitimate sons,<br />
					born from his mouth,<br />
					offspring of his,<br />
					creations of his,<br />
					and his heirs. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What does Gotama say hereon?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Albeit, Assalāyana,<br />
					the brahmin wives of brahmins<br />
					are known to have their periods,<br />
					and to conceive,<br />
					and to lie in and give suck,<br />
					do brahmins really maintain all this,<br />
					though they are themselves born of woman<br />
					like everybody else?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt149" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg149"><span class="f2">[149]</span></a> In spite of what you say,<br />
					that is what brahmins think.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Have you ever heard<br />
					that in the Yona and Kamboja countries,<br />
					and in other adjacent countries,<br />
					there are only two classes,<br />
					namely masters and slaves,<br />
					and that a master can become a slave<br />
					and vice versa?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I have heard so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What strength or support does this lend<br />
					to the brahmins' claim?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Despite what you say,<br />
					brahmins think as I have said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose a man is a murderer,<br />
					or a thief,<br />
					or a fornicator,<br />
					or a liar,<br />
					or suppose he is a slanderer,<br />
					or violent of speech,<br />
					or tattles,<br />
					or covets,<br />
					or is malevolent<br />
					or holds wrong views, -<br />
					will he after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					pass to a state of misery and woe<br />
					only if he be a noble<br />
					or a middle-class man<br />
					or a peasant,<br />
					and not if he be a brahmin?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Gotama; with such a record<br />
					the same doom awaits men of all four classes alike.

					<p class="f4">Despite what you say,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose now a man refrains from murdering<br />
					and stealing and so forth,<br />
					will he, after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution,<br />
					only pass to bliss or heaven<br />
					if he be a brahmin<br />
					and not if he be a noble<br />
					or a middle-class<br />
					man or a peasant?</p>

					take kindling wood of sal or pine or sandal or lotus<br />

					<p class="f4">What would happen, do you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would it be only the fire kindled by the high-born<br />

					<p class="f4">What strength or support does that lend to the brahmins' claim?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Despite what you say,<br />

					<p class="f4">Suppose a young noble<br />
					consorts with a brahmin maiden<br />
					and a son is born to them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is that son of theirs<br />

					<p class="f4">If a young brahmin<br />

					and is he to be styled<br />
					both a noble and a brahmin?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If a mare were put to a jackass<br />
					and the union resulted in a foal,<br />
					would their foal be like both parents<br />

					<p class="f4">Her foal would be a mule.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt154" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg154"><span class="f2">[154]</span></a> This difference I see,<br />
					but no other.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose, Assalāyana,<br />
					there were two young brahmins,<br />
					uterine brothers, -<br />
					the one an educated (Vedic) scholar,<br />
					the other uneducated and no scholar at all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which of these would be served first by brahmins<br />
					with rice from oblations to the dead,<br />
					or with rice cooked in milk for festivals,<br />
					or with a portion of a sacrifice,<br />
					or with hospitality as a guest?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, the educated scholar.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, what benefits could accrue<br />
					from gifts made to the uneducated man?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now suppose the scholar was profligate and wicked,<br />
					whereas his uneducated brother was virtuous and good.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which of the two would be served first by brahmins?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, the uneducated one,<br />
					who was virtuous and good.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, what benefits could accrue<br />
					from gifts made to a wicked profligate.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You started off with birth, Assalāyana;<br />
					then you passed to runes,<br />
					from which you have come round<br />
					to that equal purity of all four classes alike<br />
					for which I contend.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this, Assalāyana sat silent and upset,<br />
					with his shoulders hunched up<br />
					and with eyes downcast,<br />
					much exercised in mind<br />
					but without any rejoinder to hand.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing the young brahmin's plight,<br />
					the Lord went on to say: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Once on a time<br />
					there were seven brahmin sages<br />
					in thatched cabins in the wilds,<br />
					who conceived the erroneous view<br />
					that brahmins were the superior class <a id="pt155" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg155"><span class="f2">[155]</span></a><br />
					and all the rest of it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hearing of this,<br />
					the sage Āsita Devala arranged his hair and beard,<br />
					donned his orange attire,<br />
					got into his stout sandals,<br />
					took his staff<br />
					and made his appearance in the precincts of these seven brahmins' hermitage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he walked about the precincts,<br />
					he exclaimed: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where can those brahmin sages have got to?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where can they have got to?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> Who, thought they, is this<br />
					that, like a neatherd,<br />
					trots round our precincts<br />
					wondering where we can have got to?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let us put a curse on him!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they cursed the sage Āsita Devala, saying</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Shrivel to a vile cinder!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the more they cursed,<br />
					the more goodly and comely and handsome grew the sage Āsita,<br />
					so that the seven brahmin sages cried: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In vain have been our austerities,<br />
					fruitless our higher life!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, never a man have we cursed heretofore<br />
					who did not shrivel to a cinder, -<br />
					whereas the more we curse this man,<br />
					the more goodly and comely and handsome he grows!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, said Āsita;<br />
					your austerities have not been in vain<br />
					nor your higher life fruitless;<br />
					but I urge you to discard<br />
					the delusion which besets you about me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt156" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg156"><span class="f2">[156]</span></a> Yes, we will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Who, sir, are you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Have you ever heard of the sage Āsita Devala?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon the seven brahmin sages<br />
					advanced to salute Āsita,<br />
					who proceeded to tell them<br />
					that he had heard how<br />
					in their cabins<br />
					they had conceived the erroneous view<br />
					that brahmins were the superior class<br />
					and so forth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, they admitted it was so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know for certain<br />
					that the mother who bore you<br />
					had commerce with a brahmin only<br />
					and not with a non-brahmin?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know for certain<br />
					that your mother's mother<br />
					and your grandmothers for seven generations back<br />
					had commerce with brahmins only<br />
					and never with nonbrahmins?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know for certain<br />
					that the father who begat you<br />
					had commerce with a brahmin-woman only<br />
					and not with non-brahmins?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know for certain<br />
					that your father's father<br />
					and your grandfathers for seven generations back<br />
					had <a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> commerce with brahmin-women only<br />
					and not with nonbrahmins?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know how conception comes about?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes; <a id="pt157" href="../../pali/mn/mn.093.pali.bd.htm#pg157"><span class="f2">[157]</span></a> if there is coitus of the parents,<br />
					and if it is the mother's period,<br />
					and if the tutelary deity of generation be present, -<br />
					then this triple conjunction<br />
					brings about conception.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Conception. This construction is not quite correct. It is that when the mother is 'in season' and there is coitus of the parents, and if the spirit of the being to be reborn (not a presiding deity with the power to make sure everything goes all right - this should be obvious from the follow up questions which would be irrelevant if this were not the being to be reborn), then there is conception. Perhaps 'period' had a different meaning in Lord Chalmer's time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you know whether the tutelary deity there present is a noble,<br />
					or a brahmin,<br />
					or from the middle class,<br />
					or from the peasantry?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					do you know who you are?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, we do not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, Assalāyana,<br />
					those seven brahmin sages<br />
					were pressed and examined and cross-questioned<br />
					about their pretensions with regard to lineage,<br />
					they could not find a rejoinder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what rejoinder have you<br />
					when I press you, -<br />
					you who inherit the same tradition as they<br />
					and are not a mere server<br />
					to hold their oblation ladles for them?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point,<br />
					the young brahmin Assalāyana said to the Lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">-Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					wonderful!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I pray you to accept me as a disciple<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge while life lasts.</p>
