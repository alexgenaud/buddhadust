Malunkyaputta, dissatisfied that the Buddha has not answered a number of questions concerning existence and non-existence confronts Gotama who explains to him that these questions are not expounded upon because they are not relevant to the goal of ending suffering.

					<p class="f4">Once the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the reverend Māluṅkya-putta, in the course of his private meditations,<br />
					there came the following reflection:</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord does not expound to me the views -<br />
					which he has left unexpounded,<br />
					omitted<br />
					and dismissed without answer -<br />
					such as:</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is eternal, -<br />
					The world is not eternal -<br />
					The world is finite -<br />
					The world is infinite -<br />
					Life and the body are one and the same thing -<br />
					Life and the body are distinct entities -<br />
					A truth-finder<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> passes to another existence after death -<br />
					A truth-finder passes to no further existence after death -<br />
					A truth-finder both passes and does not pass to a further existence after death -<br />
					A truth-finder neither passes nor does not pass to a further existence after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not like his not expounding these things to me;<br />
					I resent it;<br />
					I will go to him and <a id="pg305"><span class="f2 g"><b>[305]</b></span></a> question him hereon.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he definitely either accepts or rejects any of these propositions,<br />
					I will follow the higher life under the Lord;<br />
					but if he fails to expound,<br />
					then I will throw up my training as an Almsman<br />
					and will revert to the lower plane of a layman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt427" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg427"><span class="f2">[427]</span></a> Rising up towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					the reverend Māluṅkya-putta betook him to the Lord,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					seated himself,<br />
					related his reflections<br />
					and the decision he had reached,<br />
					ending up by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the Lord knows that the world is eternal,<br />
					let him tell me so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Lord knows that the world is not eternal,<br />
					let him tell me so.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the Lord does not know whether the world is eternal or not,<br />
					then the only straightforward thing for one who knows not nor discerns<br />
					is to avow that he knows not nor discerns.</p>

					<p class="f4">(And he dealt similarly with each of the other problems above enumerated.)</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt428" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg428"><span class="f2">[428]</span></a> Did I ever promise you, Māluṅkya-putta, that,<br />
					if you followed the higher life under me,<br />
					I would tell you whether the world was eternal,<br />
					and all the rest of it?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or did you on your part stipulate that,<br />
					if you followed the higher life under me,<br />
					then I should tell you all this?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">It comes to this then<br />
					that I never promised,<br />
					nor did you stipulate,<br />
					that, as a condition of your following the higher life under me,<br />
					I should expound these matters to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so,<br />
					who are you-to reject whom?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Māluṅkya-putta, a man were to say<br />
					he would not follow the higher life under the Lord<br />
					until the Lord had answered all the questions you enumerate,<br />
					<a id="pt429" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg429"><span class="f2">[429]</span></a> he would get no answer from the Truth-finder<br />
					before death overtook him.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man were transfixed by an arrow<br />
					heavily coated with poison,<br />
					and his friends and kinsfolk were to get him a leech<br />
					expert in dealing with arrow-wounds,<br />
					but the man were to declare<br />
					he would not have the arrow taken out<br />
					until he knew whether the archer who had shot him<br />
					was a Noble<br />
					or <a id="pg306"><span class="f2 g"><b>[306]</b></span></a> a brahmin<br />
					or a middle-class man<br />
					or a peasant, -<br />
					what the archers name and lineage was -<br />
					whether he was tall or short or of medium height -<br />
					whether he was black or dark or fair -<br />
					what particular village or township or city he hailed from -<br />
					whether his bow was a long-bow or a cross-bow -<br />
					whether his bow-string was made from swallow-wort or bamboo or sinew or hemp or the leaves of Calotropis gigantea -<br />
					whether the shaft of the arrow was a wild reed or a planted shoot -<br />
					whether the shaft was feathered with the plumage of a vulture or a heron or a falcon or a peacock or other fowl -<br />
					whether the gut binding that shaft came from an ox or a buffalo or a hart or a monkey -<br />
					whether the arrow was a plain arrow or was barbed with horn or iron or a calfs tooth or with an oleander thorn.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt430" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg430"><span class="f2">[430]</span></a> The man would never get to know all this<br />
					before death overtook him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just in the same way,<br />
					if a man were to say he would not follow the higher life under the Lord<br />
					until the Lord had answered this pack of questions,<br />
					he would get no answer from the Truth-finder<br />
					before death overtook him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The higher life is not contingent on the truth of any thesis<br />
					that the world either is or is not eternal.</p>

					<p class="f4">In either case,<br />
					as in each of the other theses you adduce,<br />
					there still abides the fact of birth, decay and death;<br />
					there still abide the facts of grief and tribulation,<br />
					of ill, sorrow and distraction; -<br />
					of all of which I proclaim the extirpation here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt431" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg431"><span class="f2">[431]</span></a> Take therefore what I have not taught<br />
					as being left untaught by me,<br />
					and take as my teaching<br />
					what I have specifically taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have I left untaught?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have not taught that the world either is or is not eternal;<br />
					that it is finite or infinite;<br />
					that life and the body are either identical or distinct;<br />
					that after death a truth-finder either passes or does not pass to a further existence,<br />
					or does both or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why have I left these things untaught?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they are unprofitable<br />
					and not fundamental to the higher life;<br />
					because they do not conduce to weariness with mundane things,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to purga- <a id="pg307"><span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span></a> tion,<br />
					to tranquillity,<br />
					to insight,<br />
					to full enlightenment,<br />
					and to Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have I specifically taught?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have taught of Ill,<br />
					of its Origin,<br />
					of its cessation,<br />
					and of the path that leads to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why have I taught this?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because this is profitable<br />
					and fundamental to the higher life;<br />
					because this does conduce to weariness with mundane things ...<br />
					Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wherefore, Māluṅkya-putta, <a id="pt432" href="../../pali/mn/mn.063.pali.bd.htm#pg432"><span class="f2">[432]</span></a> take what I have not taught<br />
					as being left untaught by me,<br />
					and take as my teaching<br />
					what I have specifically taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Māluṅkya-putta rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
