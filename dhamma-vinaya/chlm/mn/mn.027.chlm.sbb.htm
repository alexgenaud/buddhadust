					<p class="f4">Once, when staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi was coming out of the city early in the day<br />
					in a carriage which was all white<br />
					and was drawn by four white mares,<br />
					when at a distance he espied<br />
					the Wanderer Pilotika returning to the city<br />
					and asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whence, pray, comes Vacchāyana so early in the day?</p>

					<p class="f4">I am on my way back from the recluse Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is your view of him, Vacchāyana?</p>

					<p class="f4">Has he got depth of thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is he learned, do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who, who am I to comprehend<br />
					the depth of the recluse Gotama's thought?</p>

					<p class="f4">Only his peer could comprehend that.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is lofty praise indeed that you accord him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who, who am I to praise him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Naught but praise upon praise is his,<br />
					that foremost among gods and men.</p>

					<p class="f4">What rich blessing did you find in the recluse Gotama<br />
					to make you so ardent an adherent of his?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if to an elephant forest<br />
					there came an expert elephant-tracker,<br />
					who should see there a long and broad footprint of an elephant<br />
					and should conclude it indicated a really big elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, when I saw the four footprints of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					I concluded that the Lord was all-enlightened,<br />
					that he had well and truly revealed his Doctrine,<br />
					and that his Confraternity walked aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are his four footprints?</p>

					<p class="f4">From the class of learned Nobles<br />
					there have come,<br />
					as I have seen,<br />
					keen and tried disputants,<br />
					verbal archers<br />
					skilled in hair-splitting,<br />
					and journeying about to split in twain by their lore, methinks,<br />
					any views propounded.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, hearing that the recluse Gotama<br />
					would be at this or that village or township,<br />
					frame a question to ask him,<br />
					calculating to confute him one way<br />
					if his answer be in this sense,<br />
					and another way if <a id="pg126"><span class="f2 g"><b>[126]</b></span></a> his answer be in that sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they hear that he has come,<br />
					they go to him;<br />
					and then, he, by a discourse on his Doctrine,<br />
					so informs and enlightens them,<br />
					so cheers them forward<br />
					and helps them onwards,<br />
					that in the end<br />
					they never put their question at all,<br />
					much less do they confute him,<br />
					but actually become Gotama's disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I saw this first footprint of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					I concluded that the Lord was all-enlightened,<br />
					that he had well and truly revealed his Doctrine,<br />
					and that his Confraternity walked aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the class too of learned brahmins<br />
					there have come ...<br />
					become Gotama's disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I saw this second footprint ...<br />
					walked aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the class of learned heads of houses<br />
					there have come ...<br />
					become Gotama's disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I saw this third footprint ...<br />
					walked aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the class of learned recluses<br />
					there have come ...<br />
					much less do they confute him,<br />
					but have actually begged him<br />
					to let them leave home for homelessness as Pilgrims;<br />
					and he has admitted them as such.</p>

					<p class="f4">So admitted,<br />
					and dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent,<br />
					and purged of self,<br />
					they, after no great while,<br />
					come - of themselves,<br />
					here and now -<br />
					to discern and realize,<br />
					to enter on and abide in,<br />
					that supreme goal of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which young men go forth from home<br />
					to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Say they:</p>

					<p class="f4">We were near to being undone,<br />
					quite undone!</p>

					<p class="f4">For, we that before were no true recluses,<br />
					now know we are recluses indeed;<br />
					we that before were no true brahmins,<br />
					now know we are brahmins indeed;<br />
					we that before were 'un-worthy'<br />
					(an-Arahants)<br />
					now know we have 'Worth'<br />
					indeed (are Arahats).</p>

					<p class="f4">To-day we are in very truth<br />
					recluses and brahmins of real Worth.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I saw this fourth footprint of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					I concluded that the Lord was all-enlightened,<br />
					that he had well and truly revealed his Doctrine,<br />
					and that his Confraternity walked aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such were the four footprints of the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the sight of which led me to this conclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> Thereupon, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi alighted from his carriage so white,<br />
					and, with right shoulder reverently bared<br />
					and with clasped hands stretched out towards the Lord,<br />
					thrice burst forth with this utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Homage to the Lord,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened!</p>

					<p class="f4">Homage to the Lord,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened!</p>

					<p class="f4">Homage to the Lord,<br />
					the Arahat all-enlightened!</p>

					<p class="f4">May it be mine some day and somewhere<br />
					to meet the reverend Gotama<br />
					and to have speech with him!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin proceeded to the Lord<br />
					and, after friendly greetings,<br />
					related the talk he had had with the Wanderer Pilotika.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point, brahmin,<br />
					the allegory of the elephant's footprint<br />
					is not complete in all its details.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear and hearken,<br />
					and I will tell you what will complete it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly, sir, said the brahmin in assent;<br />
					and the Lord spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is as if to an elephant forest<br />
					there came an elephant-tracker,<br />
					who should see there<br />
					long and broad footprints of an elephant,<br />
					but, being an expert in tracking elephants,<br />
					should not conclude<br />
					that this indicated a really big elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in an elephant forest<br />
					there are stunted cow-elephants<br />
					who have large feet;<br />
					and it might also be their footprints.</p>

					<p class="f4">So on he goes till he comes on<br />
					long and broad footprints making a deep lane<br />
					through the underwood.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Still the expert tracker does not conclude<br />
					that this indicates a really big elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in an elephant forest<br />
					there are cow-elephants with tushes,<br />
					who have large feet;<br />
					and it might be one of these.</p>

					<p class="f4">So on he goes till he comes on<br />
					long and broad footprints making a deep lane through the underwood<br />
					and with marks of slashing tusks high up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still he does not conclude<br />
					that this indicates a really big elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because in an elephant forest<br />
					there are cow-elephants with stumpy tusks,<br />
					who have large feet;<br />
					and it might be one of these.</p>

					<p class="f4">So on he goes till he comes on<br />
					long and broad footprints making a deep lane through the underwood<br />
					and with marks of <a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> slashing tusks high up<br />
					and also with high branches torn off;<br />
					and there he espies that elephant<br />
					beneath a tree<br />
					or in the open,<br />
					walking or standing still,<br />
					couching or reclining.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then at last he concludes<br />
					that here is his big elephant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brahmin, there arises in the world here<br />
					a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself,<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches his Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of other birth,<br />
					who hearing it<br />
					puts his trust in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and in this trust<br />
					bethinks him that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from the circle of his kinsfolk,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
