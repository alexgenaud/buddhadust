					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Mahā-Cunda, rising towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					came to the Lord,<br />
					saluted him,<br />
					and took his seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">In order to get quit and rid of the various false views current about self and the universe,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					should an Almsman start by taking thought of them?</p>

					<p class="f4">The way, Cunda, to get quit and rid<br />
					of those false views<br />
					and of the domains in which they arise<br />
					and crop up<br />
					and obtain,<br />
					is by seeing with right comprehension<br />
					that there is no 'mine,'<br />
					no 'this is I,'<br />
					no 'this is my self.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise of an Almsman<br />
					who, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of con- <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> sciousness,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward solitude<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may think that expunging is his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					the Ecstasies are called not expungings<br />
					but states of satisfaction here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise of an Almsman<br />
					who, rising above observation and reasoning,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may think that expunging is his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					the Ecstasies are called not expungings<br />
					but states of satisfaction here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise of an Almsman<br />
					who, by shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything,<br />
					feeling in his frame the satisfaction<br />
					of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may think that expunging is his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					the Ecstasies are called not expungings<br />
					but states of satisfaction here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise of an Almsman<br />
					who, putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that knows neither the pleasant nor the unpleasant,<br />
					the clarity that comes of poised equanimity<br />
					and alert mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may think that expunging is his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					the Ecstasies are called not expungings<br />
					but states of satisfaction here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The case may arise of a Brother<br />
					who - by passing altogether beyond perception of things visible<br />
					and by ceasing to perceive sense-reactions<br />
					and by not taking thought of distinctions -<br />
					has attained to the idea of Infinity of Space<br />
					and has entered on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					that plane of thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">He may think that expunging is his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					the Ecstasies are called not expungings<br />
					but states of satisfaction here and now.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">The like thought may come too<br />
					at each stage to the Almsman<br />
					who, passing altogether beyond that plane,<br />
					has successively come to the ideas of Infinity of Mind -<br />
					of Naught -<br />
					of Neither-perception-nor imperception;<br />
					he may successively think that expunging is now his.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, in the Rule of him that is Noble,<br />
					each of these planes is called not an expunging<br />
					but an excellent state.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg31"><span class="f2 g"><b>[31]</b></span></a> Here is the way to expunge.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are to expunge by resolving<br />
					that, though others may be harmful,<br />
					you will be harmless;<br />
					that, though others may kill,<br />
					you will never kill;<br />
					that, though others may steal,<br />
					you will not;<br />
					that, though others may not lead the higher life,<br />
					you will;<br />
					that, though others may lie,<br />
					traduce,<br />
					denounce,<br />
					or prattle,<br />
					you will not;<br />
					that, though others may be covetous,<br />
					you will covet not;<br />
					that, though others may be malignant,<br />
					you will be benignant,<br />
					that, though others may be given over to wrong views,<br />
					wrong aims,<br />
					wrong speech,<br />
					wrong actions,<br />
					wrong modes of livelihood,<br />
					wrong effort,<br />
					wrong mindfulness,<br />
					and wrong concentration,<br />
					you must follow<br />
					(the Noble Eightfold Path in)<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right actions,<br />
					right mode of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness<br />
					and right concentration;<br />
					that, though others are wrong about the truth<br />
					and wrong about Deliverance,<br />
					you will be right about truth<br />
					and right about Deliverance;<br />
					that, though others may be possessed by sloth and torpor,<br />
					you will free yourselves therefrom;<br />
					that, though others may be puffed up,<br />
					you will be humble-minded;<br />
					that, though others may be perplexed by doubts,<br />
					you will be free from them;<br />
					that, though others may harbour wrath,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					envy,<br />
					jealousy,<br />
					niggardliness,<br />
					avarice,<br />
					hypocrisy,<br />
					deceit,<br />
					imperviousness,<br />
					arrogance,<br />
					frowardness,<br />
					association with bad friends,<br />
					slackness,<br />
					unbelief,<br />
					shamelessness,<br />
					unscrupulousness,<br />
					lack of instruction,<br />
					inertness,<br />
					bewilderment,<br />
					and unwisdom, -<br />
					you will be the reverse of all these things;<br />
					and that, though others may clutch at<br />
					and hug the temporal<br />
					nor loose their hold thereon,<br />
					you will clutch and hug<br />
					the things that are not temporal,<br />
					and will ensue Renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the way to expunge.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is the development of the will<br />
					which is so efficacious<br />
					for right states of consciousness,<br />
					not to speak of act and speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">And therefore, Cunda,<br />
					there must be developed<br />
					the will to all the foregoing resolves I have detailed.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were both a rough, uneven <a id="pg32"><span class="f2 g"><b>[32]</b></span></a> road<br />
					and also a smooth, level road<br />
					as an alternative route;<br />
					or as if there were the choice<br />
					of a rough and a smooth ford; -<br />
					even so the harmful man<br />
					has harmlessness as his alternative,<br />
					he who kills<br />
					has his alternative in innocence of blood,<br />
					he who steals has his alternative in honesty<br />
					[and so forth through the whole of the foregoing list].</p>

					<p class="f4">As all wrong states of consciousness<br />
					must lead downwards<br />
					and all right states must lead upwards,<br />
					so the harmful man<br />
					has harmlessness for the higher state,<br />
					the man who kills<br />
					has innocence of blood for the higher state<br />
					[and so forth through the whole of the foregoing list].</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is impossible for a man<br />
					who is bogged himself<br />
					to extricate another who is bogged too;<br />
					but it is possible for a man<br />
					who is himself not bogged,<br />
					to extricate another who is.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is impossible for a man<br />
					who is himself not broken-in,<br />
					schooled<br />
					and emancipated<br />
					to break-in,<br />
					school<br />
					and emancipate another.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the converse is possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the hurtful individual<br />
					has harmlessness for his emancipation,<br />
					he who slays has innocence of blood for his emancipation,<br />
					the thief has honesty<br />
					[and so forth through the whole of the foregoing list].</p>

					<p class="f4">So I have taught how to expunge,<br />
					how to develop the will,<br />
					how to effect the alternative approach,<br />
					how to rise upwards,<br />
					and how to find emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that a fond<br />
					and compassionate teacher<br />
					can do for his disciples<br />
					in his compassion,<br />
					that have I done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Cunda, are trees under which to lodge;<br />
					here are solitude's abodes;<br />
					plunge into deepest thought and never flag;<br />
					lay not up for yourself remorse hereafter; -<br />
					this is my injunction to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Mahā-Cunda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
