					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Lord addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">In the days before my full enlightenment,<br />
					when I was as yet only a Bodhisatta<br />
					and not yet all-enlightened,<br />
					the idea came to me<br />
					to sort out my thoughts<br />
					into two separate and distinct groups.</p>

					<p class="f4">Into one category<br />
					I put thoughts about pleasures of sense,<br />
					about harm,<br />
					and about hurt;<br />
					and in a second category<br />
					came thoughts about Renunciation,<br />
					about hurting not<br />
					nor harming.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, in my life<br />
					of strenuous earnestness purged of self,<br />
					there arose within me<br />
					a thought about pleasures of sense,<br />
					I recognized that it had arisen<br />
					and that it conduced to harm -<br />
					harm to myself,<br />
					to others,<br />
					and both to myself and to others -<br />
					as being subversive of insight,<br />
					allied to overthrow,<br />
					and no help towards Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reflection that they conduced to harm<br />
					<a id="pg80"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></a> -to myself<br />
					or to others<br />
					or to both -<br />
					caused thoughts about pleasures of sense<br />
					to vanish away,<br />
					as did reflections that these thoughts<br />
					were subversive of insight,<br />
					allied to overthrow,<br />
					and no help towards Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">As each such thought severally arose,<br />
					I drove it away,<br />
					discarded it,<br />
					and rooted it out.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in just the same way<br />
					I dealt with each thought<br />
					of harm<br />
					and hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, whatsoever an Almsman<br />
					thinks much about<br />
					and dwells on,<br />
					gradually moulds his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he thinks much about pleasures of sense<br />
					and dwells thereon,<br />
					he has thereby driven away<br />
					thoughts of Renunciation,<br />
					has fostered the growth<br />
					of thoughts on pleasure,<br />
					and has applied his heart<br />
					to thoughts on pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same thing happens<br />
					with thoughts of harm<br />
					and of hurt.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the last month of the monsoon<br />
					towards autumn,<br />
					when the crops stand thick on the ground,<br />
					a cowherd looks sharply after his cattle,<br />
					beating them off here with his stick,<br />
					heading them off there,<br />
					checking them at this point<br />
					and blocking their way at that point, -<br />
					because he dreads stripes<br />
					or imprisonment<br />
					or mulcts<br />
					or censure to himself; -<br />
					even so did I see the perils,<br />
					fatuity,<br />
					and defilement<br />
					arising from wrong states of mind,<br />
					and the blessings of Renunciation,<br />
					with sanctification as their ally,<br />
					which flow from right states of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, in my life of strenuous earnestness purged of self,<br />
					there arose within me a thought of Renunciation,<br />
					I recognized that it had arisen<br />
					and that it conduced to no harm,<br />
					either to myself<br />
					or to others<br />
					or to both,<br />
					seeing that it fostered insight,<br />
					was arrayed against overthrow,<br />
					and helped on towards Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">If by night -<br />
					or by day -<br />
					or by night and by day continuously -<br />
					I thought much about Renunciation<br />
					and dwelt thereon,<br />
					never did I discern anything to breed fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if I were to go on thinking these thoughts too long,<br />
					would my body grow weary?</p>

					<p class="f4">With bodily weariness,<br />
					would my heart be defiled?</p>

					<p class="f4">With its defilement,<br />
					would my heart be sundered from concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">At this thought,<br />
					I stilled and composed <a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8l]</b></span></a> my heart within,<br />
					focussed and concentrated it, -<br />
					lest haply it should become defiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with thoughts of Renunciation,<br />
					so did I deal with thoughts of goodwill<br />
					and of benignity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Brethren, whatsoever a Brother<br />
					thinks much about<br />
					and dwells on,<br />
					gradually moulds his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he thinks and dwells much<br />
					on thoughts of Renunciation -<br />
					or goodwill -<br />
					or benignity, -<br />
					he has thereby driven away<br />
					thoughts about pleasures of sense<br />
					and about harm<br />
					and about hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in the last month of the hot season,<br />
					when all the crops have been carried<br />
					and are garnered on the confines of the village,<br />
					the cowherd in the discharge of his duties<br />
					has only to see -<br />
					from beneath a tree's shade<br />
					or in the open -<br />
					that his cows are all there, -<br />
					even so, Almsmen,<br />
					all that I had to see<br />
					was that all (right) states of mind were there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strenuous effort<br />
					won for me perseverance that never flagged;<br />
					there arose in me mindfulness<br />
					that knew no distraction,<br />
					perfect tranquillity of body,<br />
					stedfastness of mind that never wavered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of mind,<br />
					I entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy ...</p>

					<p class="f4">(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 4</a>). ...</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the third knowledge attained by me,<br />
					in the third watch of that night,; -<br />
					ignorance dispelled<br />
					and knowledge won,<br />
					darkness dispelled<br />
					and illumination won,<br />
					as befitted my strenuous and ardent life,<br />
					purged of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if<br />
					in the heart of the jungle<br />
					there was a great pond in a valley,<br />
					with a large herd of deer living there,<br />
					and there should come along<br />
					a man bent on their harm,<br />
					with no kind thought for them<br />
					and with no regard for their well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">If now he were to block up<br />
					the peaceful,<br />
					safe,<br />
					and happy road,<br />
					to open up<br />
					a treacherous way,<br />
					to plant a decoy,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and to tether there<br />
					a tame hind as a lure, -<br />
					that great herd of deer<br />
					would thus in time<br />
					come to dire calamity and dwindle <a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> away.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if another man appeared,<br />
					who meant well by the herd<br />
					and was kindly towards them<br />
					and had regard to their well-being,<br />
					he would open up that peaceful,<br />
					safe<br />
					and happy road,<br />
					close the treacherous way,<br />
					break up the decoy,<br />
					get rid of the hind, -<br />
					whereby the herd later on<br />
					would grow<br />
					and increase<br />
					and multiply.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Almsmen, is a similitude<br />
					framed by me for your edification;<br />
					and here is its meaning: -</p>

					<p class="f4">The great pond in the valley<br />
					is another name for pleasures of sense;<br />
					mankind is the herd of deer;<br />
					the first man stands for Māra the Evil One;<br />
					the treacherous way<br />
					is the evil eightfold path -<br />
					of wrong outlook,<br />
					wrong aims<br />
					and so forth;<br />
					the decoy represents sensual passion<br />
					and the hind ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second man -<br />
					he of the good-will and kind heart,<br />
					who had regard to the deers' well-being -<br />
					stands for the Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">What was styled the peaceful,<br />
					safe<br />
					and happy road,<br />
					is the Noble Eightfold Path of<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right mode of life,<br />
					right effort, and<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Brethren, I have opened up the peaceful,<br />
					safe<br />
					and happy road,<br />
					closed the treacherous way,<br />
					broken up the decoy,<br />
					and got rid of the lure of the hind.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that a teacher can do for his disciples<br />
					out of his love and compassion,<br />
					that, for compassion's sake,<br />
					have I done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are trees under which to lodge;<br />
					here are solitude's abodes;<br />
					plunge into deepest thought<br />
					and never flag;<br />
					lay not up for yourselves remorse hereafter; -<br />
					this is my injunction to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, these Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Okacaro</i> (home-pasture, <i>cf.</i> <i>gocaro</i>) seems to be a decoy in the sense in which we speak of a duck-decoy, and <i>okacārikā</i> to be its lure.
