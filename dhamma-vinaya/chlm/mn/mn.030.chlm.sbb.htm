					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					there came to him the brahmin Pingala-Koccha,<br />
					who, after exchange of courteous greetings,<br />
					took his seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching those recluses and brahmins with Confraternities and followings,<br />
					who are known and famous teachers of followers,<br />
					and are founders of sects<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of wide- <a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> spread renown, -<br />
					such as Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesa-Kambali, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belatthi-putta and Nāta-putta the Nigaṇṭha, -<br />
					is it by reason of their own professed creed<br />
					that all of them have,<br />
					or have not,<br />
					discerned truth,<br />
					or that some have discerned it,<br />
					while others have not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Let be, brahmin;<br />
					let that question pass.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will expound the Doctrine to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the listening brahmin<br />
					the Lord spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man in need,<br />
					search,<br />
					and quest of the best of wood,<br />
					were to come on just the fine upstanding tree for his purpose,<br />
					but were to disregard not only the best<br />
					but also the poorer timber<br />
					and the bark<br />
					and the wood that had fallen to the ground,<br />
					and were to cut the leafy foliage<br />
					and go off with that<br />
					in the belief that he had got the pick of the wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight,<br />
					an observer with eyes to see would say<br />
					the good man understood nothing about grades of wood<br />
					and had gone off with the twiggage<br />
					to the disregard of all the rest, -<br />
					in the vain belief<br />
					that he had got the pick of the wood;<br />
					nor would what he had got<br />
					ever be any good to him<br />
					where the best of wood was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the observer with eyes to see<br />
					would pass the same judgment<br />
					if he saw the man going off either with fallen wood -<br />
					or with the bark -<br />
					or with the poorer timber, -<br />
					in the vain belief<br />
					that he had secured the pick of the wood; -<br />
					nor would the observer say<br />
					that what the man had got<br />
					could ever be any good to him<br />
					where the best of wood was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if the man were to go off<br />
					with the best of the wood,<br />
					in the knowledge that it was really the best,<br />
					then the observer with eyes to see<br />
					would say the good <a id="pg145"><span class="f2 g"><b>[145]</b></span></a> man really understood about grades of wood<br />
					and had gone off with the choicest timber,<br />
					in the knowledge that it was really the best; -<br />
					and what he had got<br />
					would be of good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, brahmin, is the case of an individual<br />
					who for faith's sake<br />
					goes forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage, -<br />
					feeling himself beset by birth and decay and death,<br />
					by sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					by ills of body and of mind,<br />
					and by tribulation;<br />
					feeling himself beset by ills,<br />
					spent with ills,<br />
					and asking to be shewn how to make an end<br />
					of all that makes up Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					he finds himself the recipient of presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />
					and repute,<br />
					all of which things so rejoice him<br />
					and so satisfy his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is I, says he to himself,<br />
					who get things given to me<br />
					and who am thought so much of,<br />
					while these other Brethren are little known<br />
					and rank as nobodies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, he fails to develop<br />
					either desire for,<br />
					or effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind which are higher<br />
					and more excellent<br />
					than mere presents and esteem and repute; -<br />
					he grows reprobate and slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is like the man who -<br />
					being in need, search, and quest<br />
					of the best of wood,<br />
					and coming on just the fine upstanding tree for his purpose -<br />
					disregarded not only the best<br />
					but also the poorer timber<br />
					and the bark<br />
					and the fallen wood,<br />
					but cut the leafy foliage<br />
					and went off with that<br />
					in the belief that he had got the pick of the wood,<br />
					though what he had got<br />
					could never be any good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is my similitude for this first individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take next the case of an individual<br />
					who for faith's sake goes forth ...<br />
					presents, esteem, and repute,<br />
					none of which things either rejoices his heart<br />
					or satisfies his aspirations.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops desire for,<br />
					and effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent<br />
					than mere presents and esteem and repute; -<br />
					he does not grow reprobate or slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">He succeeds in living the life of virtue,<br />
					and his success <a id="pg146"><span class="f2 g"><b>[146]</b></span></a> therein<br />
					so rejoices his heart<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others, saying -<br />
					I am the man of virtue,<br />
					I am the man of fine character,<br />
					while these other Almsmen lack virtue<br />
					and are of evil character.</p>

					<p class="f4">So here he fails to develop desire for,<br />
					and effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent<br />
					than a life of virtue; -<br />
					and here he grows reprobate and slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is like the man<br />
					who went off with wood that had fallen down,<br />
					though what he had got<br />
					could never be any good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is my similitude for this second individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now take the individual who,<br />
					though rejoiced at heart<br />
					by his success in the life of virtue,<br />
					is not thereby satisfied in his aspirations<br />
					but still presses onward<br />
					till he succeeds in attaining rapt concentration,<br />
					and his success therein so rejoices his heart<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others, saying -<br />
					I am the man of sted-fastness,<br />
					I am the man with focussed heart,<br />
					while these other Almsmen<br />
					are not stedfast<br />
					but are all in a whirl.</p>

					<p class="f4">So here he fails to develop desire for,<br />
					and effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent<br />
					than rapt concentration; -<br />
					and here he grows reprobate and slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is like the man<br />
					who went off with the bark,<br />
					though what he had got<br />
					could never be any good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is my similitude for this third individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the individual who,<br />
					though rejoiced at heart<br />
					by his success in rapt concentration,<br />
					is not thereby satisfied<br />
					but still presses onward<br />
					till he succeeds in winning Mystic Insight,<br />
					and his success therein so rejoices his heart<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others, saying -<br />
					I know and see,<br />
					while these other Almsmen<br />
					neither know nor see.</p>

					<p class="f4">So here he fails to develop desire for,<br />
					and effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind which are higher<br />
					and more excellent than Mystic <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is like the man<br />
					who went off with the poorer timber,<br />
					though what he had got<br />
					could never be any good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is my similitude for this fourth individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, take the individual<br />
					who, though rejoiced at heart<br />
					by his success in winning Mystic Insight,<br />
					is not thereby satisfied in his aspirations,<br />
					nor does it puff him up<br />
					and make him disparage others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops desire for,<br />
					and effort to realize,<br />
					those other states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent than Mystic Insight;<br />
					he is neither reprobate nor slack.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what are the states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent than Mystic Insight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an Almsman who,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy -<br />
					and then the Second -<br />
					and then the Third -<br />
					and lastly the Fourth Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each of these four states of mind<br />
					is higher and more excellent<br />
					than Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, by passing altogether beyond perceptions of material objects,<br />
					and by ceasing from perceptions of sense-reactions,<br />
					and by withdrawing attention from multiplicity,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the plane of infinity of space,<br />
					or, successively,<br />
					the planes of infinity of mind -<br />
					or of Naught -<br />
					or of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">Each of these planes too<br />
					represents a state of mind<br />
					higher and more excellent than Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, lastly,<br />
					by passing altogether beyond the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and dwells in,<br />
					the cessation of all perception of things felt.</p>

					<p class="f4">Plenitude of knowledge<br />
					gives him vision,<br />
					and the Cankers within him are extirpated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a state of mind<br />
					higher and more excellent than Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the states of mind<br />
					which are higher and more excellent than Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is like the man who,<br />
					being in need,<br />
					search,<br />
					and quest of the best of timber,<br />
					came on just the fine up- <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> standing tree for his purpose<br />
					and cut out the heart of the timber,<br />
					going off with this<br />
					in the sure knowledge<br />
					that he had got the heart of the timber;<br />
					and what he had got<br />
					would be of good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, brahmin, is my similitude for this fifth individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, brahmin, the guerdon of the higher life<br />
					is not to be found in presents, esteem, and repute,<br />
					nor in a life of virtue,<br />
					nor in rapt concentration,<br />
					nor in Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is immutable Deliverance<br />
					which is the prize<br />
					and the heart<br />
					and the goal of the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the brahmin Pingala-Koccha said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, Gotama;<br />
					most excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear!</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine,<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the reverend Gotama to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life lasts.</p>
