					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the reverendĀnanda,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went in the morning early<br />
					into the city for alms<br />
					and was on his way from his round<br />
					after his meal when,<br />
					for rest during the noontide,<br />
					he turned into the Old Pleasaunce<br />
					at the palace of Migāra's Mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then, Pasenadi, king of Kosala,<br />
					was riding betimes out of town<br />
					on his elephant, Lotus<br />
					when he saw Ānanda coming.</p>

					<p class="f4">First assuring himself that it was indeed Ānanda,<br />
					by asking the noble lord Sirivadāḍḍha,<br />
					the king sent a messenger<br />
					with orders to bow down in his name<br />
					atĀnanda's feet<br />
					and to ask him, if he had nothing particular to do,<br />
					to <a id="pt118" href="../../pali/mn/mn.088.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a> be so good as to join him for a while.</p>

					<p class="f4">The message was duly delivered<br />
					and Ānanda by silence gave consent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king rode on<br />
					as far as there was good going for an elephant,<br />
					proceeding thence on foot<br />
					till he came up to Ānanda,<br />
					whom he saluted,<br />
					standing to one side as he said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">If you have nothing particular to do, <a id="pg60"><span class="f2 g"><b>[60]</b></span></a> reverendĀnanda,<br />
					be so good as to come to the bank of the river Aciravatī.</p>

					<p class="f4">By silence Ānanda gave consent and,<br />
					proceeding thither,<br />
					sat down on the seat awaiting him under a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">The king rode on<br />
					as far as there was good going for an elephant,<br />
					proceeding thence on foot to Ānanda,<br />
					whom he saluted,<br />
					standing the while as he said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Be seated on this clump of flowers, your reverence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, sire;<br />
					be you seated;<br />
					I have got a seat of my own already.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seating himself on the seat awaiting him,<br />
					the king asked Ānanda<br />
					whether the Lord would ever do<br />
					what sage recluses and brahmins would condemn.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt114" href="../../pali/mn/mn.088.pali.bd.htm#pg114"><span class="f2">[114]</span></a>	Would he ever say what they would condemn?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he ever think what they would condemn?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sir;<br />
					it is marvellous!</p>

					<p class="f4">What I could not settle in a question,<br />
					you have settled by your answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">When uninstructed fools<br />
					praise or dispraise others<br />
					without testing the evidence<br />
					and without weighing their judgment,<br />
					we do not hark back to that as final;<br />
					but we do,<br />
					when the wise and instructed<br />
					praise or dispraise others,<br />
					after testing the evidence<br />
					and weighing their judgment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me now what behaviour -<br />
					in act -<br />
					or in word -<br />
					or in thought -<br />
					is condemned by sage recluses and brahmins?</p>

					<p class="f4">The behaviour which is wrong, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is wrong?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is blameworthy.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is blameworthy?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is malevolent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is malevolent?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which ripens into Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what behaviour ripens into Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">That behaviour, sire,<br />
					which conduces to the harm<br />
					either of one's self<br />
					or of others<br />
					or of both together,<br />
					wherein wrong states of consciousness wax apace<br />
					while right states wane;<br />
					this is the kind of behaviour -<br />
					<a id="pg61"><span class="f2 g"><b>[61]</b></span></a> whether of act or of word or of thought -<br />

					and possesses every right one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me now what behaviour -<br />

					or in word -<br />
					 or in thought -<br />
					escapes condemnation by sage recluses and brahmins?</p>

					<p class="f4">The behaviour which is right, sire.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is right?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is blameless.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is blameless?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is benevolent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour is benevolent?</p>

					<p class="f4">That which ripens unto weal.</p>

					<p class="f4">What behaviour ripens unto weal?</p>

					<p class="f4">That behaviour, sire,<br />
					which conduces to the harm<br />
					neither of one's self<br />

					wherein wrong states of consciousness wane<br />
					while right states wax apace;<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt116" href="../../pali/mn/mn.088.pali.bd.htm#pg116"><span class="f2">[116]</span></a> Does the Lord commend the acquisition<br />
					of each and every right state of consciousness,<br />
					without reserve?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder, sire,<br />
					has shed every wrong state of consciousness<br />
					and possesses every right one.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful, sir,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					how well you have put it,<br />
					gratifying and delighting me so greatly that,<br />
					if only it befitted your reverence<br />
					to have my peerless elephant,<br />
					you should have him, -<br />
					or my peerless charger -<br />
					or a choice village.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, I know none of these things would befit you.</p>

					<p class="f4">But here is a piece of foreign fabric,<br />
					sixteen cubits long and eight broad,<br />
					which was sent to me,<br />
					mounted on a pole as a royal canopy,<br />
					by the king of Magadha,<br />
					Ajātasattu Videhi-putta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be so good, I beg,<br />
					as to accept this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nay, sire; I have my full set of three robes.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Spate. A flood or sudden outburst. Fit.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>

					how, when a storm has burst on the heights,<br />
					this river Aciravatī overflows in spate<br />
					both its banks.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner,<br />
					you will use this foreign fabric<br />
					to make yourself a new set of robes,<br />
					dividing up your old ones<br />
					among your fellows in the higher life,<br />
					so that my gift, methinks,<br />
					will have an overflow.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be so good, I beg,<br />
					as to accept this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda having taken the fabric,<br />
					the king said he must now be going,<br />
					as he had much to do<br />
					and attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">At your majesty's pleasure, saidĀnanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">After expressing his satisfaction and thanks,<br />
					the king rose up and<br />
					with salutations took a reverential departure.</p>

					<p class="f4">The king had not been gone long<br />
					before Ānanda went his way to the Lord,<br />
					to whom in due course<br />
					he related all that had passed<br />
					and handed over the foreign fabric.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord to the Almsmen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">It was a good thing,<br />
					a very good thing,<br />
					for King Pasenadi of Kosala<br />
					to be privileged to seeĀnanda<br />
					and commune with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
