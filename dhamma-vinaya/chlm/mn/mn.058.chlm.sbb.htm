					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo-grove where the squirrels are fed,<br />
					Prince Abhaya went to Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha and after salutations took his seat to one side and was thus addressed by Nātaputta:|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, prince, and confute the recluse Gotama;<br />
					it will greatly redound to your credit and repute<br />
					when people say that Prince Abhaya has confuted him,<br />
					despite all his power and might.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> But how am I to do it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to him, prince,<br />
					and ask him this question:</p>

					<p class="f4">Would a truth-finder say anything<br />
					which would be displeasing<br />
					and disagreeable to others?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on the One hand, he says yes,<br />
					ask him how then he differs from the ordinary man, -<br />
					who does say what is displeasing<br />
					and disagreeable to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he says no,<br />
					<a id="pt393" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg393"><span class="f2">[393]</span></a> then ask him how then it was<br />
					that he declared Devadatta to be a reprobate,<br />
					a child Of perdition,<br />
					doomed to purgatory for ages,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and beyond all hope of redemption, -<br />
					words which angered and upset Devadatta.</p>

					<p class="f4">This two-edged question<br />
					which you will put to him, prince,<br />
					is more than he will be able either to spew out<br />
					or to swallow down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like a bar of iron<br />
					fastened on a man's neck<br />
					which he can neither spew out<br />
					nor swallow down,<br />
					even so will this two-edged question<br />
					prove to the recluse Gotama;<br />
					he will not be able either to spew<br />
					or to swallow it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said Prince Abhaya obediently.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, rising from his seat<br />
					he took his leave reverently of Nātaputta<br />
					and betook him to the Lord,<br />
					whom he saluted<br />
					before taking his seat to One side.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when he was seated,<br />
					a glance at the sun<br />
					suggested to the prince<br />
					that the hour was not well-timed<br />
					for achieving his purpose that day<br />
					and that he had better defer confuting the recluse Gotama<br />
					till the morrow<br />
					and under his own roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he invited the Lord<br />
					with three others<br />
					to a meal next day;<br />
					and when by his silence the Lord intimated his consent,<br />
					the prince rose up<br />
					and departed with a reverent leave-taking.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that night's close the Lord,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					made his way early to the prince's abode<br />
					and sat down on the seat set for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The prince provided an excellent meal<br />
					of food both solid and soft,<br />
					which he served with his own hands<br />
					till the Lord had had his fill.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord's meal over and done,<br />
					Prince Abhaya seated himself to one side<br />
					on a lower seat and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Would a truth-finder, sir,<br />
					say anything which would be displeasing<br />
					and disagreeable to others?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg284"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></a> This needs qualification, prince.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sir, the Nigaṇṭhas would be at fault.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Why do you say that?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt394" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg394"><span class="f2">[394]</span></a> Well, sir, when I was sitting with Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha,<br />
					he said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Go, prince, and confute the recluse Gotama ...<br />
					(etc., as above) ...<br />
					Gotama will not be able either to spew or to swallow it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the prince was nursing his little boy,<br />
					a babe who could not yet stand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">What <a id="pt395" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg395"><span class="f2">[395]</span></a> think you, prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, from inattention on your part<br />
					or his nurse's,<br />
					he were to get a stick<br />
					or a pebble into his mouth,<br />
					what would you do with him?</p>

					<p class="f4">I should remove it from him, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I could not get it away at once,<br />
					I should grasp his head with my left hand,<br />
					crook a finger of my right hand<br />
					and pull it out, -<br />
					even if blood flowed.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Out of pity for the child.</p>

					<p class="f4">Precisely in the same spirit, prince,<br />
					the truth-finder never says anything<br />
					which he knows to be false,<br />
					untrue<br />
					and unprofitable,<br />
					and also displeasing and disagreeable to others;<br />
					never says anything<br />
					which he knows to be a fact<br />
					and true,<br />
					but unprofitable<br />
					and also displeasing and disagreeable to others;<br />
					but, should it be a fact<br />
					and true<br />
					and profitable,<br />
					but also displeasing and disagreeable to others,<br />
					then the truth-finder knows<br />
					the due season to state it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never says anything<br />
					which he knows to be false,<br />
					untrue<br />
					and unprofitable,<br />
					albeit pleasing and agreeable to others to hear;<br />
					never says anything<br />
					which he knows to be a fact<br />
					and true<br />
					but unprofitable,<br />
					albeit pleasing and agreeable to others to hear;<br />
					but, if it be a fact<br />
					and true<br />
					and profitable,<br />
					while pleasing and agreeable to others to hear,<br />
					then the truth-finder knows<br />
					the due season when to state it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Out of pity for creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir, learned scholars -<br />
					who are Nobles or brahmins<br />
					or heads of houses<br />
					or recluses -<br />
					come to the <a id="pg285"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span></a> truth-finder with a question which they have elaborated,<br />
					has the Lord previously reflected<br />
					what their question will be<br />
					and what his answer will be?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or does he answer offhand?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, prince, I will ask you a question in reply,<br />
					for such answer as you may see fit to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you know all about the several parts of a chariot?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir; I know all about that.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, prince?</p>

					<p class="f4">If people come to ask you what a particular part is,<br />
					have you previously reflected<br />
					<a id="pt396" href="../../pali/mn/mn.058.pali.bd.htm#pg396"><span class="f2">[396]</span></a> what their question<br />
					and your answer will be?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would you answer offhand?</p>

					<p class="f4">As a charioteer of repute,<br />
					I am versed in all the parts of a chariot,<br />
					and my answer would come to me offhand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, prince,<br />
					when learned scholars come to the truth-finder<br />
					with a question which they have elaborated,<br />
					his answer comes to him offhand.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, prince, I have plumbed that particular constituent of the Doctrine<br />
					and because my answer therefore comes to me offhand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Prince Abhaya said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir! wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what has been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has the Lord made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to the Lord as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the Lord to accept me<br />
					as a disciple who has found his refuge<br />
					from this day forth while life lasts.</p>
