					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					Mahā Pajāpatī the Gotamid<br />
					brought five hundred Almswomen with her to the Lord<br />
					with the request that he would exhort and instruct them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time senior Almsmen<br />
					used to take turns in preaching to Almswomen;<br />
					but the reverend Nandaka did not want to take his turn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When therefore the Lord asked Ānanda<br />
					whose turn it was<br />
					to preach to Almswomen,<br />
					he was told it was Nandaka's<br />
					but he did not want to take it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Lord ordered him to preach<br />
					and Nandaka said he would.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt271" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg271"><span class="f2">[271]</span></a> So in the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the reverend Nandaka went into Sāvatthī for alms<br />
					and on his way back after his meal<br />
					came, with a companion,<br />
					to the pleasaunce which King Pasenadi gave.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Espying him coming some way off,<br />
					the Almswomen set a seat for him<br />
					and got water for his feet.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					Nandaka washed his feet,<br />
					after which, with proper salutations,<br />
					the Almswomen also seated themselves to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said Nandaka to them: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am going to catechize you, Almswomen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those that understand will say so,<br />
					as also will those who do not understand;<br />
					anyone who has doubts or perplexities<br />
					will question me as to how this or that is,<br />
					and what the meaning is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We are pleased and delighted,<br />
					sir,<br />
					with just what your reverence suggests to us.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you, ladies? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is sight permanent or impermanent?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does the impermanent give pleasure or pain?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Pain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is it proper that what is impermanent<br />
					and fraught <a id="pg310"><span class="f2 g"><b>[310]</b></span></a> with pain and change<br />
					should be regarded as mine,<br />
					or I am it,<br />
					or it is my Self?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And does the same apply<br />
					to hearing and the other five senses?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt272" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg272"><span class="f2">[272]</span></a> It does, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because already,<br />
					we knew and saw,<br />
					clearly and aright,<br />
					that these six internal senses had no permanence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite so, ladies, quite so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the conclusion reached<br />
					by a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who knows and sees clearly and aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you think forms are permanent<br />
					or impermanent?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does the impermanent. ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because already we knew and saw,<br />
					clearly and aright,<br />
					that these external objects of the six senses<br />
					had no permanence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite so, ladies, quite so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the conclusion reached<br />
					by a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who knows and sees clearly and aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you think ocular perception is permanent<br />
					or impermanent?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does the impermanent. ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt273" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg273"><span class="f2">[273]</span></a> And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because already we knew and saw,<br />
					clearly and aright,<br />
					that these six groups of perceptions<br />
					had no permanence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite so, ladies, quite so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the conclusion reached<br />
					by a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who knows and sees clearly and aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a lighted lamp,<br />
					where oil,<br />
					wick,<br />
					shine<br />
					and sheen<br />
					are each and all impermanent<br />
					and subject to change.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would it be correct to say<br />
					that, while oil, wick and shine<br />
					were impermanent and subject to change,<br />
					yet its sheen was permanently stable,<br />
					eternal and subject to no change?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, if there was impermanence<br />
					in oil, wick and shine,<br />
					much more would the sheen be impermanent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way,<br />
					would anyone be correct<br />
					who affirmed that,<br />
					his six internal senses being impermanent,<br />
					and his feelings -<br />
					pleasant<br />
					painful<br />
					or neutral -<br />
					being felt through those six senses,<br />
					his feelings were <a id="pg311"><span class="f2 g"><b>[311]</b></span></a> permanent and stable,<br />
					eternal and subject to no change?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because it is always from specific conditions<br />
					that specific feelings arise;<br />
					<a id="pt274" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg274"><span class="f2">[274]</span></a> and these specific feelings<br />
					disappear<br />
					with the disappearance of the specific conditions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite so, ladies; quite so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the conclusion reached<br />
					by a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who knows and sees clearly and aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a fine upstanding timber-tree,<br />
					of which roots<br />
					trunk<br />
					branches<br />
					and shadow<br />
					are impermanent and subject to change.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would anyone be correct<br />
					who affirmed that,<br />
					while root trunk and branches were all impermanent<br />
					and subject to change,<br />
					the tree's shadow was permanent,<br />
					stable,<br />
					eternal<br />
					and subject to no change?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, if all else be impermanent,<br />
					much more would the shadow be impermanent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way,<br />
					would anyone be correct in affirming that,<br />
					the sense-objects of his six external senses being impermanent,<br />
					and his several feelings being felt through those sense-objects,<br />
					his feelings were permanent<br />
					and stable,<br />
					eternal<br />
					and subject to no change?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because it is always from specific conditions<br />
					that specific feelings arise;<br />
					and these disappear<br />
					with the disappearance of the specific conditions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite so, ladies; quite so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the conclusion reached<br />
					by a disciple of the Noble,<br />
					who knows and sees clearly and aright.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like an expert butcher<br />
					or butcher's man<br />
					who, having killed a cow,<br />
					should with a sharp knife<br />
					dissect out the carcase,<br />
					so as not to spoil the flesh within<br />
					or the hide without,<br />
					by cutting out<br />
					severing<br />
					and dissevering<br />
					all the inward tendons<br />
					and sinews<br />
					and fastenings,<br />
					ana then should <a id="pt275" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg275"><span class="f2">[275]</span></a> clothe the cow in its hide once more<br />
					and declare that under the hide<br />
					she was connected together<br />
					just the same as before.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would he be correct in so declaring?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir, the cow would be disconnected beneath the hide.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg312"><span class="f2 g"><b>[312]</b></span></a> This illustration has been adduced<br />
					to make my meaning clear, -<br />
					which is this: -<br />
					the flesh within is another expression<br />
					for the six internal senses,<br />
					as the hide<br />
					is for the external objects of the six senses;<br />
					the tendons and sinews and fastenings within<br />
					represent passion's delight;<br />
					the sharp knife<br />
					means Noble understanding<br />
					which severs,<br />
					dissevers,<br />
					and cuts out<br />
					inner vices<br />
					and bonds<br />
					and ties.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are seven factors of Enlightenment, ladies,<br />
					by the growth and increase of which within himself<br />
					an Almsman, by the destruction of the Cankers,<br />
					comes, here and now,<br />
					to dwell in the Deliverance of heart and mind<br />
					that knows no Cankers,<br />
					which, of and by himself,<br />
					he has discerned<br />
					realized<br />
					and developed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are these seven factors? -</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>1,2,3,4,5,6 and, um, Upekkha: Detachment.</p>

						</div>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who cultivates the several factors -<br />
					each dependent on aloofness,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					and cessation,<br />
					each maturing by Renunciation -<br />
					of mindfulness,<br />
					study of the Doctrine,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					bliss,<br />
					tranquillity<br />
					and rapt concentration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the seven factors of Enlightenment.

					<a id="pt276" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg276"><span class="f2">[276]</span></a> His exhortation ended,<br />
					the reverend Nandaka told the ladies<br />
					it was now time for them to be going.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With grateful thanks for his discourse,<br />
					those Alms-women rose up and,<br />
					with salutations and with deep reverence,<br />
					departed to the Lord,<br />
					whom they saluted,<br />
					remaining standing respectfully to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they stood there,<br />
					the Lord told the Almswomen<br />
					it was time for them to be going.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So with salutations<br />
					and with deep reverence<br />
					they withdrew.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They had not been gone long<br />
					when the Lord addressed the Almsmen,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as on the mid-month Sabbath<br />
					there is no doubt or perplexity<br />
					in the minds of the people<br />
					whether there is no moon or full-moon,<br />
					for there is then no moon at all, -<br />
					even so in the same way<br />
					those Almswomen are glad to have heard Nandaka's exposition<br />
					but their thought has not yet waxed to the full.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Turning then to Nandaka,<br />
					the Lord directed him<br />
					to repeat the same exposition over again<br />
					to those same Almswomen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Obediently, the reverend Nandaka did so,<br />
					in the <a id="pg313"><span class="f2 g"><b>[313]</b></span></a> selfsame words,<br />
					on the morrow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt277" href="../../pali/mn/mn.146.pali.bd.htm#pg277"><span class="f2">[277]</span></a> With grateful thanks once more for his discourse,<br />
					those Almswomen rose up and,<br />
					with salutations and deep reverence,<br />
					departed to the Lord,<br />
					whom they saluted,<br />
					remaining standing to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they stood there,<br />

					<p class="f4">So with salutations<br />

					<p class="f4">They had not been gone long when the Lord addressed the Almsmen,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is just like the Sabbath of the full-moon,<br />
					when there is no doubt or perplexity<br />
					in the minds of the people<br />
					whether there is no moon or full-moon,<br />
					for it is full-moon.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					those Almswomen are glad to have heard Nandaka's discourse<br />
					and now their thoughts have waxed to the full.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of all those five hundred Almswomen<br />
					even the most backward is of the conversion,<br />
					immune from future states of suffering,<br />
					safe and sure,<br />
					destined to win entire Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
