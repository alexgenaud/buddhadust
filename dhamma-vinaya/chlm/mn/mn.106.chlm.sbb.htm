					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the Kuru country, -<br />
					a township of theirs is Kammassadhamma -<br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Fleeting are pleasures of sense, -<br />
					empty,<br />
					false<br />
					and vain,<br />
					the creation of illusion<br />
					and the chatter of fools.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures of sense,<br />
					whether here and now or hereafter,<br />
					and the <a id="pt262" href="../../pali/mn/mn.106.pali.bd.htm#pg262"><span class="f2">[262]</span></a> perception of either kind of such pleasures<br />
					are both under Māra's sway;<br />
					they are his domain,<br />
					his pasturage,<br />
					his haunt<br />
					and his resort.</p>

					<p class="f4">In them lurk those bad and wrong dispositions of heart<br />
					which breed covetise<br />
					and spite<br />
					and clamour,<br />
					and so hamper the progress in this creed<br />
					of the disciple of the Noble<br />
					that, he, recognizing all this,<br />
					addresses himself to the task<br />
					of developing his heart<br />
					so as to overcome the World<br />
					by concentrating his thought,<br />
					in the conviction<br />
					that thereby covetise<br />
					and spite<br />
					and temper<br />
					will not come into being<br />
					and that by their extermination<br />
					his heart will cease to be dwarfed<br />
					and will develop aright<br />
					and beyond measure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this resolve to develop,<br />
					his heart is satisfied with its scope,<br />
					and therewithal he either now wins Permanence, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that this trend of an Almsman's consciousness<br />
					may get him to Permanence. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the first path to Permanence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that all pleasures of sense,<br />
					both here and hereafter,<br />
					and the perception of either kind of pleasures, -<br />
					these and all visible Form,<br />
					all consist of the four primary Elements<br />
					or of derivatives therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this resolve to develop,<br />
					his heart is satisfied with its scope,<br />
					and therewithal he either now wins Permanence, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that this trend of an Almsman's consciousness<br />
					may get him to Permanence. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the second path to Permanence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt263" href="../../pali/mn/mn.106.pali.bd.htm#pg263"><span class="f2">[263]</span></a> Again, the disciple of the Noble reflects that fleeting and transient are all pleasures of sense, both <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> here and hereafter,<br />
					and the perception of either kind of pleasure,<br />
					together with all visible Form,<br />
					present or to be,<br />
					and also with all perception of Form,<br />
					present or to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">But what is fleeting and transitory<br />
					may not evoke joy<br />
					nor claim a welcome<br />
					nor attract!</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this resolve to develop,<br />
					his heart is satisfied with its scope,<br />
					and therewithal he either now wins Permanence, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that this trend of an Almsman's consciousness<br />
					may get him to Permanence. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the third path to Permanence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that fleeting and transient<br />
					are the pleasures of sense,<br />
					both here and hereafter,<br />
					as also is the perception of either kind of pleasure, -<br />
					together with all visible Form,<br />
					present or to be,<br />
					and with all perception of Form,<br />
					present or to be,<br />
					and also with all perception of Permanence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, where all perceptions alike<br />
					pass away and leave no trace behind,<br />
					that is excellent and good,<br />
					to wit the Realm of Naught!</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this resolve,<br />
					his heart is satisfied with its scope<br />
					and therewithal he either now wins the Realm of Naught, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass that the Almsman's mental trend<br />
					may get him to the Realm of Naught. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the first path to the Realm of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, in the wilds<br />
					or at the foot of a tree,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					reflects that all this is void of a Self<br />
					or anything like a Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this thought,<br />
					his heart is satisfied,<br />
					and therewithal he now wins the Realm of Naught, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that the Almsman's mental trend<br />
					may get him to the Realm of Naught. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the second path to the Realm of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that not anywhere is he aught<br />
					of anything else<br />
					nor is <a id="pt264" href="../../pali/mn/mn.106.pali.bd.htm#pg264"><span class="f2">[264]</span></a> aught of him anywhere<br />
					in anything else.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this thought,<br />
					his heart is satisfied<br />
					and therewithal he now wins the Realm of Naught, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that this trend of the Almsman's consciousness<br />
					may get him to the Realm of Naught. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed the third path to the Realm of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg153"><span class="f2 g"><b>[153]</b></span></a> Again, the disciple of the Noble reflects<br />
					that fleeting and transient<br />
					are all pleasures of sense,<br />
					both here and hereafter,<br />
					as also is the perception of every kind of pleasure, -<br />
					together with all visible Form,<br />
					present or to be,<br />
					and with all perception of Form,<br />
					present or to be,<br />
					and with all perception of Permanence,<br />
					and also with the Realm of Naught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, where all perception passes away<br />
					and leaves no trace behind,<br />
					that is excellent and good,<br />
					to wit Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception!</p>

					<p class="f4">Living up to this thought,<br />
					his heart is satisfied<br />
					and therewithal he now wins Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception, -<br />
					or sets his heart on Understanding.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death<br />
					it comes to pass<br />
					that the trend of this Almsman's consciousness<br />
					may get him to Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is deemed to be the path that guides to Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point the reverend Ānanda said to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose the Almsman has reached<br />
					the stage of indifference and poise<br />
					which tells him that,<br />
					if the past had not been,<br />
					his present would not now be his,<br />
					and that, if the future were not to come about,<br />
					his future will not follow;<br />
					and suppose that consequently<br />
					he discards all that is<br />
					and all that has come about; -<br />
					has that Almsman won Nirvana?</p>

					<p class="f4">It may or may not be his.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the cause<br />
					and what are the conditions<br />
					determining whether Nirvana is<br />
					or is not his?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman who has reached<br />
					this stage of indifference and poise<br />
					<a id="pt265" href="../../pali/mn/mn.106.pali.bd.htm#pg265"><span class="f2">[265]</span></a> may rejoice in<br />
					and welcome it<br />
					and be attracted thereby;<br />
					but if he does,<br />
					then his mind derives therefrom<br />
					support and sustentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, no Almsman who is dependent on sustentation wins Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where does he find his sustentation?</p>

					<p class="f4">From the sphere of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman, it might be said,<br />
					derives his sustentation from the best source?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it is true that he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, take an Alms- <a id="pg154"><span class="f2 g"><b>[154]</b></span></a> man who,<br />
					having reached the same stage of indifference and poise,<br />
					rejoices not<br />
					nor welcomes<br />
					nor is attracted thereby.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inasmuch as he does not feel like this,<br />
					his mind derives therefrom no support<br />
					nor sustentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the Almsman who is independent of sustentation<br />
					who has won Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir;<br />
					marvellous, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Stage by stage<br />
					has the Lord revealed how to traverse the Flood.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, sir,<br />
					is Noble Deliverance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case, Ānanda,<br />
					of the disciple of the Noble<br />
					who reflects that all these pleasures of sense,<br />
					here or hereafter -<br />
					with all perceptions of them,<br />
					all Form,<br />
					here or hereafter,<br />
					with all perceptions of Form,<br />
					all perceptions of Permanence,<br />
					of the Realm of Naught,<br />
					and of Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception,<br />
					- all mean mere Individuality,<br />
					whereas one thing only is Deathless,<br />
					to wit,<br />
					the heart's Deliverance,<br />
					which knows no sustentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, Ānanda,<br />
					I have explained the several paths that guide to Permanence,<br />
					to the Realm of Naught,<br />
					to Neither-Perception-nor-Non-Perception,<br />
					to traversing the Flood stage by stage,<br />
					right up to Noble Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that a fond and compassionate teacher<br />
					can do for his disciples<br />
					out of his compassion,<br />
					<a id="pt266" href="../../pali/mn/mn.106.pali.bd.htm#pg266"><span class="f2">[266]</span></a> all that have I done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda, are trees under which to sit;<br />
					here are abodes of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ponder deeply<br />
					and never flag;<br />
					lay not up remorse for yourself hereafter; -<br />
					this is my exhortation to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverendĀnanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
