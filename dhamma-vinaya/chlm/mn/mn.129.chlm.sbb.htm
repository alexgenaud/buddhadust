					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are three marks,<br />
					signs<br />
					and attributes of a fool.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He thinks what he should not,<br />
					he says what he should not,<br />
					and he does what he should not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If the fool were not thus characterized,<br />
					how could the wise recognize<br />
					that here is a fool<br />
					and a bad man?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is because he is so characterized<br />
					that they can recognize him for what he is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In three modes does the fool, here and now,<br />
					experience pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he is sitting in an assembly<br />
					or in the street<br />
					or at the cross-roads,<br />
					then, if talk turns on that sort of thing,<br />
					the fool, should he be a murderer<br />
					or a thief<br />
					or a lecher<br />
					or a liar,<br />
					or should he indulge in strong drink,<br />
					bethinks him that by nature<br />
					he is just what they are discussing<br />
					and that he will be branded as such accordingly. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first mode<br />
					in which, here and now,<br />
					the fool experiences pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Further, the fool sees how,<br />
					when a guilty robber is arrested,<br />
					he is punished by the authorities in divers ways, -<br />
					by flogging <a id="pt164" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg164"><span class="f2">[164]</span></a> ... <i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.013.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 13</a>)</i> ...<br />
					are impaled alive<br />
					or are beheaded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereon, the fool bethinks himself<br />
					that he has in himself all the qualities<br />
					which entail such punishment of guilt by the authorities,<br />
					and that, if they only knew him,<br />
					they would punish him too<br />
					in just the same way. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the second mode in which,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the fool experiences pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg249"><span class="f2 g"><b>[249]</b></span></a> Further, while the fool is upon his bench<br />
					or bed,<br />
					or is lying on the ground,<br />
					the sense of his wrongdoing<br />
					in act<br />
					speech<br />
					and thought<br />
					hangs round him,<br />
					rests on him<br />
					and envelops him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as at eventide<br />
					the falling shadows from the great mountain-peaks<br />
					rest and lie upon the ground,<br />
					so rests the sense of his wrongdoing<br />
					upon the fool <a id="pt165" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg165"><span class="f2">[165]</span></a>. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Herein, the fool thinks to himself<br />
					how, while he has not done what was good<br />
					and right<br />
					and reverent,<br />
					he has done what is bad<br />
					and cruel<br />
					and wrong,<br />
					and that his hereafter<br />
					will tally therewith.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consequently, mourning and distress of heart is his;<br />
					he laments and beats his breast and is distraught.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the third mode in which,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the fool experiences pain and anguish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					that foolish Almsman,<br />
					whose life here has been so wrong<br />
					in act and word and thought,<br />
					passes to a state of woe and misery<br />
					or to purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now purgatory is all that is called unpleasing,<br />
					unpleasant<br />
					and disagreeable; -<br />
					it is far from easy<br />
					to picture the pains of purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point an Almsman asked<br />
					whether an illustration could be given.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Certainly said the Lord,<br />
					who then proceeded as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a guilty robber<br />
					who is hauled before the king for punishment,<br />
					and whom the king orders to be put to death<br />
					in the early morning by a hundred javelins;<br />
					and his people proceed accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At mid-day the king,<br />
					on asking,<br />
					is told the man is still alive<br />
					and then orders him to be put to death<br />
					by a hundred more javelins;<br />
					and his people proceed accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Towards evening,<br />
					he is again told the man is still alive<br />
					and then orders him to be put to death<br />
					by a hundred more javelins;<br />
					<a id="pt166" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg166"><span class="f2">[166]</span></a> and his people proceed accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you, Almsmen?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would not the man<br />
					in the course of dying by the three hundred javelins<br />
					experience pain and anguish there-from?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sir;<br />
					pain and anguish would be his<br />
					even with a hundred javelins,<br />
					much more with thrice the number.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Taking up a small stone<br />
					as big as his hand,<br />
					the <a id="pg250"><span class="f2 g"><b>[250]</b></span></a> Lord then asked which was the bigger, -<br />
					that stone<br />
					or Himavant, king of mountains.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The stone the Lord is holding is but small; -<br />
					as compared with Himavant, king of mountains,<br />
					that stone does not count;<br />
					it is an inconceivable fraction;<br />
					there is no comparison possible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Almsmen,<br />
					the pain and anguish the man felt<br />
					in dying by the three hundred javelins<br />
					does not count<br />
					as compared with the pains felt in purgatory;<br />
					it is an inconceivable fraction of them;<br />
					there is no comparison possible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Him do the wardens of purgatory<br />
					subject to the fivefold pegging, -<br />
					they drive a red-hot peg<br />
					through each hand and each foot,<br />
					and a fifth through his chest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Severe and acute pain is his,<br />
					but death comes not to him<br />
					before he has worked off his evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he is pegged down,<br />
					those wardens trim him with axes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, sparing only his head and feet,<br />
					they trim him with razors.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then they harness him to a chariot<br />
					and drive him to and fro<br />
					over a fiery expanse,<br />
					all aflame and ablaze.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt167" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg167"><span class="f2">[167]</span></a> Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then those wardens make him<br />
					climb up and down a huge mountain<br />
					of red-hot embers,<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next they plunge him<br />
					head over heels<br />
					into the glowing Cauldron of Brass,<br />
					all afire and aflame and ablaze,<br />
					where he is boiled in the seething foam, -<br />
					whirled now up,<br />
					now down,<br />
					now to this side<br />
					now to that.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Severe and acute ... evil-doing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the wardens<br />
					cast him into Great Purgatory,<br />
					which is -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">four-square, four-doored, a realm quadrangular,<br />
							walled all around with steel and roofed with steel,<br />
							with incandescent floor of molten steel;<br />
							a hundred leagues this way and that its range extends.</p>

					<p class="f4">In many a figure, Almsmen,<br />
					could I tell of purgatory,<br />
					for it is far from easy to recount<br />
					all the pains of purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg251"><span class="f2 g"><b>[251]</b></span></a> Creatures there are, Almsmen,<br />
					in the animal world<br />
					which are graminivorous<br />
					and with their teeth<br />
					munch clean moist grass, -<br />
					like horses and oxen,<br />
					donkeys and goats and deer,<br />
					and all other grass-eating animals. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fool who in this world was fond of tastes<br />
					and has committed evil deeds,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					is reborn among these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Creatures there are<br />
					in the animal world<br />
					which live on dung<br />
					and at the distant scent of dung<br />
					hurry up to enjoy the feast, -<br />
					for all the world like brahmins<br />
					scenting a sacrifice<br />
					and running up to enjoy the feast.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt168" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg168"><span class="f2">[168]</span></a> Such are cocks and swine,<br />
					dogs and jackals,<br />
					and all other dung-eating animals. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fool ... reborn among these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Creatures there are<br />
					in the animal world<br />
					which are born in darkness,<br />
					grow up in darkness<br />
					and in darkness die, -<br />
					like insects,<br />
					maggots,<br />
					delving worms,<br />
					and all other denizens of darkness. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fool ... reborn among these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Creatures there are<br />
					in the animal world<br />
					which are born in water,<br />
					grow up in water<br />
					and in water die, -<br />
					like fish,<br />
					tortoises,<br />
					crocodiles,<br />
					and all other aquatic creatures. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fool ... reborn among these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Creatures there are<br />
					in the animal world<br />
					that are born in filth,<br />
					grow up in filth<br />
					and die in filth, -<br />
					like the organisms in stinking fish<br />
					or in festering corpses<br />
					or putrid rice<br />
					or standing pond or pool.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt169" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg169"><span class="f2">[169]</span></a> The fool ... reborn among these.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In many a figure, Almsmen,<br />
					could I tell of the animal world,<br />
					for it is far from easy to recount<br />
					all the pain of rebirth as an animal.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a man<br />
					who should cast into the sea<br />
					a yoke with a single aperture in it,<br />
					carried now west by an easterly wind,<br />
					now east by a westerly wind,<br />
					now north by a southern wind,<br />
					and now again south by a northerly blast;<br />
					and suppose there were in that sea<br />
					a blind turtle<br />
					who came out once a century.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you, Almsmen?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would that blind turtle<br />
					get his neck into that single aperture?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He might, sir; -<br />
					some time or other,<br />
					after the lapse of a very long time.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg252"><span class="f2 g"><b>[252]</b></span></a> Well; the turtle would be quicker,<br />
					and find less difficulty,<br />
					in doing that,<br />
					say I,<br />
					than the fool<br />
					in his after misery and woe<br />
					can become a human being once again.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because here we have a case<br />
					not of holy and righteous life<br />
					and of right-doing,<br />
					but of mutual devouring<br />
					and of mutual slaughter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Should he - some time or other,<br />
					after the lapse of a very long time -<br />
					become a human being again,<br />
					it is into one of the low stocks -<br />
					outcastes,<br />
					trappers,<br />
					rush-plaiters,<br />
					cartwrights<br />
					and rat catchers -<br />
					that he is reborn,<br />
					to a life of vagrancy and want and penury,<br />
					scarce getting food and drink for his belly<br />
					or clothes to his back.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He grows up ill-favoured and unsightly,<br />
					misshapen,<br />
					a weakling,<br />
					blind,<br />
					or deformed,<br />
					or lame,<br />
					or a cripple;<br />
					he gets no food drink and clothes,<br />
					<a id="pt170" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg170"><span class="f2">[170]</span></a> nor carriage,<br />
					garlands scents and perfumes;<br />
					he misconducts himself<br />
					in act word and thought;<br />
					his misconduct brings him at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to a state of misery and woe<br />
					or to purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just as if a gamester,<br />
					by throwing the lowest possible cast with the dice,<br />
					loses son, wife, and all his possessions,<br />
					and finally goes into bondage<br />
					in his own person.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His ill-luck and loss<br />
					is but insignificant<br />
					as compared with the ill-luck and loss<br />
					of the man who,<br />
					by evil-doing in act word and thought,<br />
					passes at death<br />
					to a future of misery and woe or to purgatory, -<br />
					which is folly's consummation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are three marks<br />
					and signs<br />
					and attributes<br />
					of a wise man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He thinks what he ought to think,<br />
					he says what he ought to say,<br />
					and he does what he ought to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If the wise man were not thus characterized,<br />
					how could the wise recognize<br />
					that here is a wise and good man?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is because he is so characterized<br />
					that they can recognize him for what he is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In three modes<br />
					does the wise man,<br />

					<p class="f4">If he be seated in an assembly<br />
					or in the street<br />
					or at the cross-roads,<br />
					then, if talk turns on that sort of thing,<br />
					the wise man,<br />
					should he be guiltless of murder<br />
					theft<br />
					lechery <a id="pt171" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg171"><span class="f2">[171]</span></a> or lying<br />

					bethinks him <a id="pg253"><span class="f2 g"><b>[253]</b></span></a> that he is just the guiltless man<br />
					whom they are discussing<br />
					and that he will be recognized as such accordingly. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first mode in which,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the wise man experiences well-being and satisfaction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Further, the wise man sees how,<br />
					when a guilty robber is arrested,<br />
					he is punished by the authorities in divers ways, -<br />

					are impaled alive<br />
					or are beheaded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereon, the wise man bethinks himself<br />
					that he has in himself<br />
					none of those evil qualities<br />
					which entail such punishment of guilt by the authorities,<br />
					and that he will be recognized<br />
					as not having those evil qualities. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the second mode in which,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the wise man experiences well-being and satisfaction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Further, while the wise man is upon his bench<br />
					or bed,<br />
					or is lying on the ground,<br />
					the sense of his right-doing<br />
					in act word and thought<br />

					<p class="f4">Just as at eventide<br />

					rest and lie upon the ground,<br />
					so rests the sense of his right-doing<br />
					upon the wise man. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereon, the wise man thinks to himself<br />
					how, while he has not done<br />
					what was bad cruel and wrong,<br />
					he has done what is good and right and reverent,<br />
					and that his hereafter<br />
					will tally therewith.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consequently no mourning<br />
					or distress of heart is his;<br />
					he laments not<br />
					nor beats his breast<br />
					nor is he distraught. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the third mode in which,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the wise man experiences wellbeing and satisfaction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					that wise man,<br />
					whose life here has been so right<br />
					in act and word and thought,<br />
					<a id="pt172" href="../../pali/mn/mn.129.pali.bd.htm#pg172"><span class="f2">[172]</span></a> passes to a future state<br />
					of bliss in heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now heaven is all that is called<br />
					pleasing, pleasant and agreeable; -<br />
					it is far from easy<br />
					to picture the happiness of heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point an Almsman asked<br />
					whether an illustration could be given.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Certainly said the Lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">What are the Seven? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the first place<br />
