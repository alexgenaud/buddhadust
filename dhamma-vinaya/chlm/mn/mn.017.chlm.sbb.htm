					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">I will expound to you the principles of the forest life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give ear and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Lord, was their response to the Lord,<br />
					who then went on to speak as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, dwelling in the forest,<br />
					finds that the mindfulness<br />
					which was not his before<br />
					is still not his,<br />
					that the stedfastness of heart<br />
					which was not his before<br />
					is still not his,<br />
					that the Cankers<br />
					which had not passed before<br />
					are not passing away from him now,<br />
					that the Peace beyond compare<br />
					which he had not won before<br />
					is still to win,<br />
					and that in the forest<br />
					it is hard to satisfy a Pilgrim's needs<br />
					in the matter of clothing,<br />
					food,<br />
					bed,<br />
					and medicaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such case, the Brother should ponder this over and -<br />
					be it by night or be it by day -<br />
					should quit that forest<br />
					and reside there no longer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, take an Almsman<br />
					who, dwelling in the forest,<br />
					has just the same experiences<br />
					except that he has no difficulty there<br />
					in satisfying a Pilgrim's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">He too should ponder this over<br />
					and reflect that it was not for clothing and the like<br />
					that he went forth from home to homelessness<br />
					but that here he is acquiring<br />
					neither mindfulness nor stedfastness of heart,<br />
					is not getting rid of the Cankers<br />
					nor winning the Peace beyond com- <a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> pare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing this,<br />
					he should quit that forest<br />
					and reside there no longer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now an Almsman<br />
					who, dwelling in the forest,<br />
					finds that the mindfulness<br />
					which was not his before<br />
					is now his,<br />
					that the stedfastness of heart<br />
					which was not his before<br />
					is now his,<br />
					that the Cankers<br />
					which had not passed away before<br />
					have now passed away from him,<br />
					and that he is now winning that Peace beyond compare<br />
					which he had not won before, -<br />
					but that he finds it hard there<br />
					to satisfy a Pilgrim's needs<br />
					in the matter of clothing,<br />
					food,<br />
					bed,<br />
					and medicaments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pondering over this,<br />
					he should reflect that it was not for these latter things<br />
					that he went forth from home to homelessness<br />
					but that by residing in that forest<br />
					the mindfulness which was not his before<br />
					is now his ...<br />
					not won before.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing this,<br />
					he should dwell on in that forest<br />
					and not quit it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, if, in addition<br />
					to growth in mindfulness and so forth,<br />
					he finds no difficulty there<br />
					in satisfying a Pilgrim's needs,<br />
					he should similarly dwell on in that forest<br />
					and not quit it.</p>

					<p class="f4">(The same considerations should guide him)<br />
					if his abode is near a village,<br />
					a township,<br />
					a city,<br />
					a country,<br />
					or an individual.</p>

					<p class="f4">If all goes well with his growth Within,<br />
					he will cleave to that individual<br />
					while life lasts;<br />
					he will not quit him,<br />
					although hounded away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
