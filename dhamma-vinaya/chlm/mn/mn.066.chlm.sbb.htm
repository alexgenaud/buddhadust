					<p class="f4">Once the Lord was staying in the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_angas">Aŋga</a> country,<br />
					where there is a township named Āpaṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					he went into town for alms and,<br />
					after his meal,<br />
					on his way back from his round,<br />
					went into a wood to rest<br />
					during the heat of the day<br />
					and seated himself at the foot of a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise, the reverend Udāyī had been into town for alms<br />
					and on his way back<br />
					had gone into that same wood to rest<br />
					during the heat of the day,<br />
					and was sitting under a tree<br />
					in solitary meditation<br />
					when there came to him the reflection<br />
					that their Lord had dispelled many an unhappy state of consciousness<br />
					and had implanted many a happy one,<br />
					had dispelled <a id="pg319"><span class="f2 g"><b>[319]</b></span></a> many a wrong state<br />
					and implanted many a right one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arising towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					Udāyī betook him to the Lord and,<br />
					taking <a id="pt448" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg448"><span class="f2">[448]</span></a> his seat to One side after due salutations,<br />
					first related how there had come to him the foregoing reflection<br />
					and then went on to say:</p>

					<p class="f4">In former times, sir,<br />
					we had meals in the evening<br />
					and in the morning<br />
					and in the afternoon,<br />
					in contravention of all proper hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Time came when the Lord bade Almsmen<br />
					give up having meals out of hours<br />
					in the afternoon;<br />
					and personally I felt it a painful wrench,<br />
					when the faithful laity came with excellent meals in the afternoon<br />
					out of hours,<br />
					to realize that by our Lord's bidding<br />
					they were to be rejected<br />
					and by our Blessed One's bidding<br />
					to be renounced.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, sir, out of our love and veneration for the Lord<br />
					and in our sense of duty and obligation,<br />
					we gave up these afternoon meals,<br />
					out of hours;<br />
					and we ate morning and evening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then came a time when the Lord bade Almsmen give up eating at night,<br />
					out of hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again it was a painful wrench<br />
					to realize that by our Lord's bidding<br />
					the better meal of the two was to be rejected<br />
					and by our Blessed One's bidding to be renounced.</p>

					<p class="f4">The old custom had been,<br />
					when a man was given curry in the afternoon,<br />
					for him to say:<br />
					Carry it away<br />
					and we will have it for supper together.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, dainty dishes, sir,<br />
					all come at night, -<br />
					rarely by day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, out of our love and veneration for the Lord<br />
					and in our sense of duty and obligation,<br />
					we gave up eating at night,<br />
					out Of hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">Time was when,<br />
					going in quest of alms<br />
					when it was too dark to see,<br />
					Almsmen used to walk straight into the village-pond<br />
					or the cesspool,<br />
					or stray into a hedge,<br />
					or blunder over a cow asleep,<br />
					or associate with young fellows<br />
					before or after crimes,<br />
					or were solicited by women.</p>

					<p class="f4">I remember once being out for alms after dark<br />
					when a woman espied me for a flash<br />
					as she was scouring a pot<br />
					and screamed out:</p>

					<p class="f4">Woe is me!<br />
					A goblin is after me!</p>

					<p class="f4">I told her I was not a goblin<br />
					but an Almsman <a id="pt449" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg449"><span class="f2">[449]</span></a> standing there for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then you must be a poor orphan<br />
					with no father or mother left alive;<br />
					you would <a id="pg320"><span class="f2 g"><b>[320]</b></span></a> do better to cut your belly out once for all<br />
					than to let it drive you<br />
					to prowl about for alms in the dark like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I remember this, sir,<br />
					the reflection comes to me<br />
					that our Lord has dispelled many an unhappy state of consciousness<br />
					and has implanted many a happy one,<br />
					has dispelled many a wrong state<br />
					and implanted many a right one!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, in their folly, Udāyī,<br />
					there are silly people who,<br />
					when told by me to give something up,<br />
					think that it is an insignificant matter of no moment<br />
					and that I am too particular, -<br />
					with the result that they do not give it up<br />
					but grow dissatisfied with me<br />
					and with the Almsmen who desire to be trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">This insignificant, thing<br />
					grows into a bond strong enough to hold them fast,<br />
					a stout and solid bond,<br />
					a bond that rots not away,<br />
					a massive log round their necks.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Springe = spring = snare. — OED.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">It is like a quail caught in a springe,<br />
					there to abide slaughter<br />
					or captivity<br />
					or death.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Withy: the flexible branch of a Willow used as string — OED.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Would it be correct to say<br />
					that to the bird in this plight<br />
					the withy which holds it<br />
					is a bond without strength or might,<br />
					a bond that is flimsy and unsubstantial?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir; to the quail it is a bond<br />
					strong enough to hold her fast,<br />
					a stout and solid bond to her,<br />
					a bond that rots not away,<br />
					a very log round her neck.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Udāyī,<br />
					there are silly people ...<br />
					a log round their necks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the case of young men who,<br />
					when told by me to give something up,<br />
					<a id="pt450" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg450"><span class="f2">[450]</span></a> think that in itself<br />
					it is an insignificant matter of no moment,<br />
					but that their Lord, the Blessed One,<br />
					has bidden them to give it up and renounce it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they give it up,<br />
					without growing dissatisfied with me<br />
					or with the Almsmen who wish to be trained;<br />
					and the result is that, unruffled,<br />
					they live in meekness and contentment,<br />
					with hearts as free as wild things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unto these<br />
					the bonds prove to be without strength or might,<br />
					flimsy and unsubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a king's elephant -<br />
					with tusks like the stilts of a plough,<br />
					the huge scion of a noble race,<br />
					the hero of many a battle -<br />
					who may be bound with stout straps and thongs,<br />
					but has only to give quite a little heave of his <a id="pg321"><span class="f2 g"><b>[321]</b></span></a> body<br />
					in order to burst his bonds asunder<br />
					and go forth where he lists.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it be correct to say<br />
					that to the elephant<br />
					his bonds are strong enough to hold him fast, -<br />
					stout, solid bonds<br />
					that rot not away,<br />
					a massive log round his neck?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir; to such an elephant<br />
					these bonds<br />
					which he can burst asunder<br />
					by a slight heave of his body,<br />
					are to him without strength or might,<br />
					flimsy and unsubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Udāyī,<br />
					the young men who,<br />
					when told by me to give something up, ...<br />
					flimsy and unsubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a poor wretch<br />
					with just a single crazy hovel<br />
					open to the crows<br />
					and squalid to view,<br />
					with just a single crazy pallet<br />
					squalid to view,<br />
					<a id="pt451" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg451"><span class="f2">[451]</span></a> with no store of grain<br />
					beyond just his sorry seed-corn in a solitary crock,<br />
					and with just his one ill-favoured wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">If such a poor wretch sees an Almsman<br />
					from a pleasaunce<br />
					with clean hands and feet<br />
					seated after a good dinner<br />
					meditating in the cool shade,<br />
					he might think it a pleasant and healthful thing to be a recluse<br />
					and might like to become a Pilgrim too,<br />
					cutting off his hair and beard,<br />
					donning the yellow robe<br />
					and going forth from home to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But suppose he could not bring himself,<br />
					as the first step to becoming a Pilgrim,<br />
					to give up his poor hovel and pallet,<br />
					his poor crock of seed-corn<br />
					and wife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it be correct to say of him<br />
					that the bonds which keep him<br />
					from giving up his sorry belongings<br />
					in order to become a Pilgrim,<br />
					are to him weak bonds,<br />
					without strength or might,<br />
					flimsy and unsubstantial?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					to him they are bonds<br />
					strong enough to hold him fast,<br />
					stout, solid bonds<br />
					that rot not away,<br />
					a massive log round his neck.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same, Udāyī,<br />
					with those silly people who,<br />
					when told by me to give something up,<br />
					think that it is an insignificant matter<br />
					of no moment<br />
					and that I am too particular, -<br />
					with the result that they do not give it up<br />
					but grow dissatisfied with me<br />
					and with the Almsmen who desire to be trained.</p>

					<p class="f4">This insignificant thing<br />
					grows into a bond strong enough to hold them <a id="pg322"><span class="f2 g"><b>[322]</b></span></a> fast,<br />
					a stout, solid bond,<br />
					a bond that rots not away,<br />
					a massive log round their necks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or it is like a rich man,<br />
					or his son,<br />
					<a id="pt452" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg452"><span class="f2">[452]</span></a> of great wealth and possessions,<br />
					with abounding treasure<br />
					and substance<br />
					and lands<br />
					and raiment<br />
					and wives<br />
					and slaves both male and female.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he, likewise, sees an Almsman from a pleasaunce<br />
					with clean hands and feet<br />
					seated after a good dinner<br />
					meditating in the cool shade,<br />
					he too might think it a pleasant<br />
					and a healthful thing<br />
					to be a recluse<br />
					and might like to become a Pilgrim too,<br />
					cutting off his hair and beard,<br />
					donning the yellow robe<br />
					and going forth from home to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And suppose he could bring himself,<br />
					as the first step to becoming a Pilgrim,<br />
					to give up all these riches<br />
					and to go forth from home to homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it be correct to say of him<br />
					that his bonds were strong enough to hold him fast,<br />
					stout solid bonds<br />
					that rot not away,<br />
					a massive log round his neck?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					to him they are flimsy and unsubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with those young men who,<br />
					when told by me to give something up,<br />
					think that in itself it is an insignificant matter<br />
					of no moment<br />
					but that their Lord ...<br />
					<a id="pt453" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg453"><span class="f2">[453]</span></a> flimsy and unsubstantial.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four types of individuals to be found in the world, Udāyī:</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is progressing towards giving up ties<br />
					and renouncing them,<br />
					but in his progress is assailed by thoughts and ideas<br />
					into which ties enter;<br />
					he gives in to them,<br />
					does not give them up,<br />
					does not dispel and eject them,<br />
					does not annihilate them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him I call not detached but attached.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I have gauged his individuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second is similarly progressing<br />
					and is similarly assailed,<br />
					but does not give in<br />
					to such thoughts and ideas,<br />
					he gives them up;<br />
					he dispels, ejects and annihilates them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him too do I call not detached but attached.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I have gauged his individuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">The third is similarly progressing<br />
					but in his progress is<br />
					from time to time<br />
					assailed by distraction in mindful- <a id="pg323"><span class="f2 g"><b>[323]</b></span></a> ness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness is slow of growth,<br />
					but he is quick to give up such distraction,<br />
					quick to dispel, eject and annihilate it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who lets fall two or three drops of water<br />
					into an iron pot heated all day long;<br />
					the drops of water are slow in falling<br />
					but quick to disappear and vanish.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just the same with this third man<br />
					who is progressing ...<br />
					and annihilate it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him also do I call not detached but attached.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt454" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg454"><span class="f2">[454]</span></a> And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I have gauged his individuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Last comes the man who,<br />
					recognizing that ties are a root of Ill,<br />
					frees himself from ties<br />
					and is Delivered by destroying ties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him do I call detached<br />
					and not attached.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because I have gauged his individuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five in number are the pleasures of sense,<br />
					namely,<br />
					visible shapes,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes,<br />
					and touch, -<br />
					all of them pleasant,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with passion and lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">The satisfaction and the gratification<br />
					derived from these five pleasures of sense<br />
					is called sensual pleasure,<br />
					filthy pleasure,<br />
					vulgar pleasure,<br />
					ignoble pleasure,<br />
					not to be practised,<br />
					not to be developed,<br />
					not to be fostered,<br />
					but to be dreaded,<br />
					say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman who,<br />
					divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					develops and dwells in the First Ecstasy ...<br />
					and successively in the Third<br />
					and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the pleasure of renunciation,<br />
					the pleasure of solitude,<br />
					the pleasure of tranquillity,<br />
					the pleasure of utter enlightenment,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					to be practised,<br />
					to be developed,<br />
					to be fostered,<br />
					and not to be dreaded,<br />
					say I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who has developed<br />
					and dwells in the First Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here there is no fixity, -<br />
					in that observation and reflection<br />
					are not yet stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor is there fixity in the Second Ecstasy, -<br />
					in that <a id="pg324"><span class="f2 g"><b>[324]</b></span></a> Zest and satisfaction are not yet stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor again is there fixity in the Third Ecstasy, -<br />
					in that <a id="pt455" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg455"><span class="f2">[455]</span></a> the bliss of rapt concentration survives.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the Brother has developed<br />
					and dwells in the Fourth Ecstasy,<br />
					then I say there is fixity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the First Ecstasy<br />
					I say that it sufficeth not;<br />
					I tell you to give it up<br />
					and pass beyond it, -<br />
					to the Second Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Second Ecstasy<br />
					I say that it sufficeth not;<br />
					I tell you to give it up<br />
					and pass beyond it, -<br />
					to the Third Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Third Ecstasy<br />
					I say that it sufficeth not;<br />
					I tell you to give it up<br />
					and pass beyond it, -<br />
					to the Fourth Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Fourth Ecstasy I say<br />
					that it sufficeth not;<br />
					I tell you to give it up<br />
					and pass beyond it -<br />
					to the plane of Infinity and Space -<br />
					by passing beyond all perception of things material,<br />
					by eliminating perception of sense-reactions,<br />
					and by not heeding perception of differences.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too sufficeth not<br />
					and you must give it up<br />
					and pass beyond it, -<br />
					to the plane of Infinity of Consciousness<br />
					and thence successively<br />
					to the planes of Naught<br />
					and of Neither-perception-nor-non-perception,<br />
					<a id="pt456" href="../../pali/mn/mn.066.pali.bd.htm#pg456"><span class="f2">[456]</span></a> till at last the Almsman develops<br />
					and dwells in the state<br />
					where perceptions and sensations cease to be.</p>

					<p class="f4">Can you point, Udāyī,<br />
					to any bond,<br />
					big or small,<br />
					which I have omitted to order to be given up?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spake the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Udāyī rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
