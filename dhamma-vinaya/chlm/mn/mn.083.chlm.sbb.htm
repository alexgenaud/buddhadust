					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Mithilā in the Makhādeva mango-grove,<br />
					at a certain spot there he smiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the reverend Ānanda: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the cause,<br />
					what are the reasons<br />
					for the Lord's smiling;<br />
					for, Truth-finders never smile<br />
					without cause and reason.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So, with one shoulder respectfully bared<br />
					and with folded palms reverently extended towards the Lord,<br />
					Ānanda asked what made him smile,<br />
					seeing that Truth-finaers never smile<br />
					without cause and reason.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In bygone times,<br />
					Ānanda,<br />
					in this same Mithilā<br />
					there was a king named Makhādeva,<br />
					a righteous monarch,<br />
					an emperor stablished in righteousness,<br />
					who dealt righteously<br />
					with brahmins and householders<br />
					in town and country,<br />
					and observed the four holy-days of each month.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt75" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg75"><span class="f2">[75]</span></a> After many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />
					this king told his barber to report<br />
					when he found a grey hair in his head.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, when grey hairs had appeared,<br />
					after many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />
					the barber said to the king: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The messengers of the gods<br />
					have come to your Majesty; -<br />
					grey hairs have appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, at the king's bidding,<br />
					the barber plucked out those grey hairs with tweezers<br />
					and laid them on the outstretched palm of the king,<br />
					who, having first rewarded the barber with a choice village,<br />
					summoned his eldest son and said to him: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The messengers of the gods have come to me; -<br />
					grey hairs have appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of human pleasures<br />
					I have had my fill;<br />
					and it is time now for me<br />
					to seek pleasures celestial.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Be it yours to rule this realm,<br />
					while I,<br />
					cutting off hair and beard,<br />
					and donning the yellow robes,<br />
					will go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whenever, in your turn, my son,<br />
					you find grey hairs appearing,<br />
					reward your barber with a village,<br />
					hand over your sovereignty to your eldest son,<br />
					cut off your hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">See to it you maintain this high tradition,<br />
					and do not prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, among any two <a id="pg40"><span class="f2 g"><b>[40]</b></span></a> persons,<br />
					there is a break in a tradition so high,<br />
					he who breaks it<br />
					is the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, I enjoin you, my son,<br />
					to maintain this high <a id="pt76" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg76"><span class="f2">[76]</span></a> tradition<br />
					and not to prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon, King Makhādeva,<br />
					after having bestowed the village on his barber<br />
					and after establishing his eldest son as king,<br />
					here in this very Makhādeva mango-grove<br />
					cut off his hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes,<br />
					and went forth on Pilgrimage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervaded all four quarters of the world,<br />
					pervaded the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere, -<br />
					with thoughts of love all-embracing<br />
					and vast beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hate or ill-will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as with thoughts of love,<br />
					so too did he pervade the whole length and breadth of the world<br />
					with thoughts of compassion<br />
					and of sympathy<br />
					and of poise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For eighty-four thousand years<br />
					that king had enjoyed the pleasures of youth;<br />
					for a like term he was viceroy;<br />
					for a like term he reigned as king;<br />
					and for a further eighty-four thousand years<br />
					he lived the higher life<br />
					as a Pilgrim in this grove,<br />
					where he cultivated the four excellent states (Brahmā-vihara),<br />
					so that at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					he passed to the heavens of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">After many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />
					King Makhādeva's son in turn<br />
					told his barber to report when he found a grey hair in his head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, when grey hairs had appeared,<br />
					after many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />

					<p class="f4">See to it you maintain this high tradition,<br />
					and do not prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, among any two persons,<br />
					there is a break in a tradition so high,<br />
					he who breaks it<br />
					is the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, I enjoin you, my son,<br />
					to maintain this high tradition<br />
					and not to prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon, King Makhādeva,<br />
					after having bestowed the village on his barber<br />
					and after establishing his eldest son as king,<br />
					here in this very Makhādeva mango-grove<br />
					cut off his hair and beard,<br />

					<p class="f4">And as with thoughts of love,<br />
					so too did he pervade the whole length and breadth of the world<br />
					with thoughts of compassion<br />
					and of sympathy<br />
					and of poise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For eighty-four thousand years<br />
					that king had enjoyed the pleasures of youth;<br />
					for a like term he was viceroy;<br />
					for a like term he reigned as king;<br />
					and for a further eighty-four thousand years<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And so in unbroken succession<br />
					did not only the son<br />
					but also the grandson<br />
					and the later descendants of King Makhādeva,<br />
					to the number of eighty-four thousand in all.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The last of three kings so to do was Nimi,<br />
					a righteous monarch,<br />
					an emperor stablished in righteousness<br />
					who dealt righteously<br />
					with brahmins and householders<br />
					in town and country,<br />
					and observed the four noly-days of each month.

					A time came when,<br />
					as the Thirty-three gods were <a id="pt79" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg79"><span class="f2">[79]</span></a> met together in assembly in their Hall of Truth,<br />
					<a id="pg41"><span class="f2 g"><b>[41]</b></span></a> the talk turned on what a great thing it was,<br />
					what a very great thing,<br />
					for the people of Videha<br />
					to have in Nimi a monarch of such signal righteousness;<br />
					and Sakka, king of gods,<br />
					asked the Thirty-three gods<br />
					whether they would like to see King Nimi;<br />
					and they said they would.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It was then the mid-month holy-day,<br />
					and the king,<br />
					having bathed,<br />
					was seated,<br />
					fasting,<br />
					in the upper story of his gorgeous palace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As easily as a strong man<br />
					could stretch out his arm<br />
					or draw it back,<br />
					Sakka vanished from the Thirty-three<br />
					and appeared before King Nimi,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is a great thing for you, sire,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					that, as the thirty-three gods sat together<br />
					in their Hall of Truth,<br />
					they were saying how fortunate,<br />
					how very fortunate,<br />
					the people of Videha are<br />
					to have in you a monarch of such signal righteousness;<br />
					and they would like to see you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will send a chariot<br />
					drawn by a thousand steeds<br />
					to fetch you;<br />
					get into it without any qualms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By his silence Nimi gave consent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sakka bade his charioteer Mātali<br />
					yoke a thousand steeds to the chariot<br />
					and go to the King Nimi with the message<br />
					that it had been sent for him by Sakka,<br />
					king of gods,<br />
					and that the king was to get into that celestial <a id="pt80" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg80"><span class="f2">[80]</span></a> chariot without qualms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So be it, answered Mātali obediently,<br />
					and bore the message to Nimi,<br />
					adding:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By which route am I to conduct your majesty?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Shall it be by the route travelled by evildoers<br />
					to reap the fruits of their evil-doing,<br />
					or by the route of the righteous<br />
					to reap the fruits of their righteousness?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take me by both routes, Mātali,<br />
					was the king's answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To the Hall of Truth in due course Mātali brought the king,<br />
					to whom, as he saw him coming some way off,<br />
					Sakka said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Draw near, sire;<br />
					welcome, sire!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Thirty-three gods<br />
					were talking of your signal righteousness,<br />
					and wished to see you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rejoice, sire,<br />
					among the gods in heaven's glories.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Enough, your Excellency!<br />
					Let Mātali take me home again,<br />
					where I will deal righteously<br />
					with my <a id="pg42"><span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span></a> brahmins and householders<br />
					in town and country,<br />
					and observe the four holy-days in each month.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sakka gave orders to Mātali accordingly,<br />
					and back in the chariot King Nimi was borne to Mithilāl,<br />
					where he dealt righteously<br />
					with his folk<br />
					and <a id="pt81" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg81"><span class="f2">[81]</span></a> duly observed the holy-days of each month.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />
					King Nimi in his turn told his barber to report when he found a grey hair in his head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly, when grey hairs had appeared,<br />
					after many years,<br />
					after many hundreds and thousands of years,<br />
					the barber said to the king: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The messengers of the gods<br />
					have come to your Majesty; -<br />
					grey hairs have appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, at the king's bidding,<br />
					the barber plucked out those grey hairs with tweezers<br />
					and laid them on the outstretched palm of the king,<br />
					who, having first rewarded the barber with a choice village,<br />
					summoned his eldest son and said to him: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The messengers of the gods have come to me; -<br />
					grey hairs have appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of human pleasures<br />
					I have had my fill;<br />
					and it is time now for me<br />

					<p class="f4">Be it yours to rule this realm,<br />
					while I,<br />
					cutting off hair and beard,<br />
					and donning the yellow robes,<br />
					will go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whenever, in your turn, my son,<br />
					you find grey hairs appearing,<br />
					reward your barber with a village,<br />
					hand over your sovereignty to your eldest son,<br />
					cut off your hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">See to it you maintain this high tradition,<br />
					and do not prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, among any two persons,<br />
					there is a break in a tradition so high,<br />
					he who breaks it<br />
					is the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, I enjoin you, my son,<br />
					to maintain this high tradition<br />
					and not to prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon, King Makhādeva,<br />
					after having bestowed the village on his barber<br />
					and after establishing his eldest son as king,<br />
					here in this very Makhādeva mango-grove<br />
					cut off his hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes,<br />
					and went forth on Pilgrimage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervaded all four quarters of the world,<br />
					pervaded the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere, -<br />
					with thoughts of love all-embracing<br />
					and vast beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hate or ill-will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as with thoughts of love,<br />
					so too did he pervade the whole length and breadth of the world<br />
					with thoughts of compassion<br />
					and of sympathy<br />
					and of poise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For eighty-four thousand years<br />
					that king had enjoyed the pleasures of youth;<br />
					for a like term he was viceroy;<br />
					for a like term he reigned as king;<br />
					and for a further eighty-four thousand years<br />

					<a id="pt82" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg82"><span class="f2">[82]</span></a> he passed to the heavens of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now King Nimi had a son named Kaḷāra Janaka<br />
					who did not go forth<br />
					from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					but broke that high tradition,<br />
					and proved the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You may think, Ānanda,<br />
					that someone else was the King Makhādeva of those days<br />
					who founded that high tradition;<br />
					but that would be an error.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It was I myself<br />
					who was then King Makhādeva;<br />
					and it was I who then founded that high tradition<br />
					which later generations continued.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That high tradition, however,<br />
					conduces not to aversion,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to stilling,<br />
					to peace,<br />
					to illumination,<br />
					to enlightenment,<br />
					and to Nirvana, -<br />
					but only to a future in the heavens of Brahmā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whereas the high tradition<br />
					which I have now founded<br />
					does so conduce;<br />
					for, it is the Noble Eightfold Path of<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					<a id="pt88" href="../../pali/mn/mn.083.pali.bd.htm#pg88"><span class="f2">[88]</span></a> right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness, and<br />
					right concentration. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the high tradition<br />
					which I have founded to-day.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I enjoin you, Ānanda,<br />
					to continue this high tradition<br />
					and not to prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When, among any two persons,<br />
					there is a break in a tradition so high,<br />
					he who breaks it is the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, I enjoin you, Ānanda,<br />
					to maintain this high tradition,<br />
					and not to prove the last of the line.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart<br />
					the rverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
