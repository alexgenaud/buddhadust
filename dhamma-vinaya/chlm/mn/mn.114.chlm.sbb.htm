					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Ensue. A word of many shades of meaning. We do not encounter this use today. From L. <i>insequi</i> = <i>in + sequí</i> <i>in sequence</i>. Mimic, to follow, to follow-up, to persue, succeed, result.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will expound what should be ensued<br />
					and what should not be ensued.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken and pay attention,<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the listening Almsmen the Lord began: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Behaviour in act -<br />
					or in speech -<br />
					or in thought -<br />
					is twofold,<br />
					that to be ensued<br />
					and that not to be ensued,<br />
					each being alternative to the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same applies<br />
					to mental arisings,<br />
					to <a id="pt46" href="../../pali/mn/mn.114.pali.bd.htm#pg46"><span class="f2">[46]</span></a> the admission of perceptions,<br />
					as also to the acquisition of views<br />
					and the entertainment of personality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the venerable Sāriputta to the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand as follows<br />
					the expanded meaning of the Lord's succinct<br />
					and unexpanded utterance: -</p>

					<p class="f4">i. Behaviour in act is twofold,<br />
					that to be ensued<br />
					and that not to be ensued,<br />
					each being alternative to the other; -<br />
					these were the Lord's words<br />
					and they proceed from the following: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Behaviour in act is<br />
					(a) not to be ensued<br />
					if thereby wrong dispositions wax apace<br />
					while right dispositions wane,<br />
					but (b) to be ensued<br />
					if thereby wrong dispositions wane<br />
					while right dispositions wax apace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, first,<br />
					what kind of behaviour in act leads, if ensued,<br />
					to wrong dispositions waxing apace<br />
					while right dispositions wane? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who destroys life, -<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					with hands dyed in blood,<br />
					given to killing and slaying,<br />
					merciless to living creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he takes what has not been given to him, -<br />
					he appropriates in thievish fashion<br />
					other people's belongings<br />
					in village and jungle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he is a fornicator, -<br />
					he has intercourse with women<br />
					under the care of mother<br />
					or father<br />
					or brother<br />
					or sister<br />
					or relations,<br />
					with women married<br />
					or affianced,<br />
					or even with women<br />
					wearing the very garlands of betrothal. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the kind of behaviour <a id="pt47" href="../../pali/mn/mn.114.pali.bd.htm#pg47"><span class="f2">[47]</span></a> in act<br />
					which, if ensued,<br />
					makes wrong dispositions wax apace<br />
					while right dispositions wane.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what kind of behaviour in act<br />
					leads to wrong dispositions waning<br />
					while right dispositions wax apace? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who,<br />
					putting all killing from him<br />
					and abstaining from killing anything,<br />
					laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of pity and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">He puts theft from him<br />
					and abstains from theft,<br />
					taking only what is given to him<br />
					and never appropriating to himself in thievish fashion<br />
					other people's belongings<br />
					in village and jungle,<br />
					that have not been given to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the matter of fornication,<br />
					he is no wrongdoer<br />
					but abstains from all such wrongdoing;<br />
					he has no intercourse<br />
					with women under the care of mother<br />
					or father<br />
					or brother<br />
					or sister<br />
					or relations,<br />
					or with women affianced<br />
					pledged<br />
					or betrothed. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the kind of <a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> behaviour in act<br />
					which makes wrong dispositions wane<br />
					while good dispositions wax apace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hence proceeded the Lord's utterance: -</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, first,<br />
					what kind of behaviour in speech leads, if ensued,<br />
					to wrong dispositions waxing apace<br />
					while right dispositions wane? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who is a liar,<br />
					who, when cited to give his testimony <a id="pt48" href="../../pali/mn/mn.114.pali.bd.htm#pg48"><span class="f2">[48]</span></a> before assembly<br />
					or village-meeting<br />
					or among his kindred<br />

					says he knows<br />

					or says he did not see<br />
					when he did see,<br />
					'deliberately lying<br />
					in the interests either of himself<br />
					or of other people<br />
					or for some trifling gain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he is a slanderer; -<br />
					what he has heard here<br />
					he tells elsewhere<br />
					to split up one set of people;<br />
					what he hears elsewhere<br />
					he tells here<br />
					to split up another set;<br />
					so that he is a dissolver of harmony<br />
					and no reconciler of them that are at variance;<br />
					discord is the pleasure<br />
					and delight<br />
					and joy<br />
					and motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he is a reviler; -<br />
					what he says is rough and harsh,<br />
					hurtful and wounding to others,<br />
					fraught with anger and discord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he is a tattler; -<br />
					he speaks out of season,<br />
					without regard to the facts,<br />
					of what is unprofitable;<br />
					never speaks of the Doctrine and Rule;<br />
					his talk is trivial and ill-timed,<br />
					frivolous,<br />
					leading nowhere<br />
					and void of profit -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the kind of behaviour in speech<br />
					which if ensued,<br />
					makes wrong dispositions wax apace<br />
					while right dispositions wane.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, what kind of behaviour in speech<br />
					leads, if ensued,<br />

					<p class="f4">Take a man who has put lying <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> from him<br />

					<p class="f4">When cited to give his testimony before assembly<br />

					or to say he did not see<br />
					when he did, -<br />
					never deliberately lying<br />
					in the interests either of himself<br />
					or of other people<br />
					or for some trifling gain.</p>

					<p class="f4">All slander he has put from him<br />
					and from slander he abstains;<br />
					what he hears here<br />
					he does not repeat elsewhere,<br />
					to split up one set of people,<br />
					nor does he repeat here<br />
					what he has heard elsewhere,<br />
					so as to split up another set.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a promoter of harmony<br />

					<p class="f4">Concord is the pleasure<br />

					and joy<br />
					and motive of his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">He reviles not;<br />

					<p class="f4">What he says is without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					hearty,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">No tattler,<br />
					he abstains from all tattle; -<br />
					he speaks in season<br />
					and according to the facts;<br />
					he is profitable in his speech,<br />
					ever of the Doctrine and Rule;<br />
					seasonable and memorable are his words,<br />
					illuminating,<br />
					well-marshalled<br />
					and of great profit. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the kind of behaviour in speech<br />

					<p class="f4">Hence proceeded the Lord's utterance: -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the kind of behaviour in thoughts<br />

					<p class="f4">Next, what kind of behaviour in thoughts<br />

					in the yearning they were his.</p>

					<p class="f4">He harbours no rancour,<br />
					nor is he corrupt of intent; -<br />
					his wish is that the creatures round him<br />

					<p class="f4">Hence proceeded the Lord's utterance: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Behaviour in thoughts is twofold,<br />
