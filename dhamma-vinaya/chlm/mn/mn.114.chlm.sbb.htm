					<p class="f4">Behaviour in act -<br />
					or in speech -<br />
					or in thought -<br />
					is twofold,<br />
					that to be ensued<br />
					and that not to be ensued,<br />

					<p class="f4">And the same applies<br />

					as also to the acquisition of views<br />
					and the entertainment of personality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the venerable Sāriputta to the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I understand as follows<br />
					the expanded meaning of the Lord's succinct<br />
					and unexpanded utterance: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">i. Behaviour in act is twofold,<br />
					that to be ensued<br />
					and that not to be ensued,<br />
					each being alternative to the other; -<br />
					these were the Lord's words<br />

					<p class="f4">Now, first,<br />

					<p class="f4">Take a man who destroys life, -<br />
					he is a hunter,<br />
					with hands dyed in blood,<br />

					<p class="f4">Or he takes what has not been given to him, -<br />

					<p class="f4">Next, what kind of behaviour in act<br />
					leads to wrong dispositions waning<br />
					while right dispositions wax apace? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take a man who,<br />

					<p class="f4">He puts theft from him<br />

					in village and jungle,<br />
					that have not been given to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the matter of fornication,<br />
					he is no wrongdoer<br />

					<p class="f4">Or he is a reviler; -<br />

					<p class="f4">I endorse and repeat <a id="pt54" href="../../pali/mn/mn.114.pali.bd.htm#pg54"><span class="f2">[54-55]</span></a> each word you have said;<br />

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, Sāriputta, I lay it down<br />

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, Sāriputta said to the Lord<br />
