					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					there came to him the Wanderer Vaccha-gotta, who, <a id="pt484" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg484"><span class="f2">[484]</span></a> after salutations, took his seat to one side and thus began:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Do you hold, Gotama,<br />
					that the world is eternal,<br />
					and <a id="pg342"><span class="f2 g"><b>[342]</b></span></a> that this is the only true view,<br />
					all other views being false?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, do you hold that the world is non-eternal,<br />
					and that that is the only true view,<br />
					all other views being false?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you hold that the world is finite,<br />
					and that this is the only true view,<br />
					all other views being false?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you hold, then, that the world is non-finite,<br />
					and that that is the only true view,<br />
					all other views being false?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar questions and answers follow about -<br />
					Life and the body are identical,<br />
					Life and the body are distinct;<br />
					The truth-finder passes to another existence after death here,<br />
					The truth-finder does not pass to another existence after death here,<br />
					The truth-finder both does and does not pass to another existence after his death here,<br />
					<a id="pt485" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg485"><span class="f2">[485]</span></a> The truth-finder neither passes nor does not pass to another existence after his death here.]</p>

					<p class="f4">To each and all of my questions, Gotama,<br />
					you have answered in the negative.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Scout. Of Scandanavian origin. ON: skuta, shute (a taunt). To reject with scorn (a proposition) to treat as absurd (an idea) to dismiss scornfuly the pretensions (or a person). — O.E.D. Not related to scout: &lt; to listen; to spy out. This is not an idea found in the Pali. There is no rejecting these ideas. To reject them would be to be holding another, contrary idea. Gotama follows not after, or turns away from [<i>anupaghāta</i>] or does not deal with these ideas.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">What, pray, is the danger you discern in these views<br />
					which makes you scout them all?</p>

					<p class="f4">To hold that the world is eternal -<br />
					or to hold that it is not,<br />
					or to agree to any other <a id="pt486" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg486"><span class="f2">[486]</span></a> of the propositions you adduce, Vaccha, -<br />
					is the thicket of theorizing,<br />
					the wilderness of theorizing,<br />
					the tangle of theorizing,<br />
					the bondage and the shackles of theorizing,<br />
					attended by Ill,<br />
					distress,<br />
					perturbation<br />
					and fever;<br />
					it conduces not to aversion,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					peace,<br />
					illumination<br />
					and Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the danger I discern in these views,<br />
					which makes me scout them all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there any view which you have adopted, Gotama?</p>

					<p class="f4">The adoption of views<br />
					is a term discarded for the truth-finder,<br />
					who has had actual vision<br />
					of the nature,<br />
					orgin<br />
					and cessation<br />
					of things material -<br />
					of feelings -<br />
					of <a id="pg343"><span class="f2 g"><b>[343]</b></span></a> perception -<br />
					of plastic forces -<br />
					and of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it is that,<br />
					by destroying,<br />
					stilling,<br />
					suppressing,<br />
					discarding<br />
					and renouncing all supposings,<br />
					all imaginings,<br />
					and all tendencies to the pride<br />
					of saying I or mine,<br />
					the truth-finder is Delivered<br />
					because no fuel is left<br />
					to keep such things going.</p>

					<p class="f4">When his heart is thus Delivered, Gotama,<br />
					where is an Almsman<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> reborn hereafter?</p>

					<p class="f4">Reborn does not apply to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is not reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not reborn does not apply.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is both reborn and not reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reborn and not reborn does not apply.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he is neither reborn nor not-reborn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither reborn nor not-reborn does not apply to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">To each and all of my questions, Gotama,<br />
					you have replied in the negative.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt487" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg487"><span class="f2">[487]</span></a> I am at a loss and bewildered;<br />
					the measure of confidence you inspired by our former talk<br />
					has disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">You ought to be at a loss and bewildered, Vaccha.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, this Doctrine is profound,<br />
					recondite,<br />
					hard to comprehend,<br />
					rare,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					only to be understanded of the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">To you it is difficult, -<br />
					who hold other views<br />
					and belong to another faith and objective,<br />
					with a different allegiance<br />
					and a different master.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I in turn will question you,<br />
					for such<br />
					answer as you see fit to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Vaccha?</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were a fire blazing in front of you,<br />
					would you know it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were asked what made that fire blaze,<br />
					could you give an answer?</p>

					<p class="f4">I should answer that what made it blaze<br />
					was the fuel<br />
					consisting of bracken and sticks.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the fire went out,<br />
					would you know it had gone out?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg344"><span class="f2 g"><b>[344]</b></span></a> If now you were asked<br />
					in what direction the fire had gone,<br />
					whether to east, west, north or south,<br />
					could you give an answer?</p>

					<p class="f4">The question does not apply.</p>

					<p class="f4">Since the fire was kept alight<br />
					by bracken and sticks,<br />
					and since it had consumed its supply of fuel<br />
					and had received no fresh supplies,<br />
					it is said to have gone out<br />
					for lack of fuel to sustain it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Vaccha,<br />
					all things material <a id="pt488" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg488"><span class="f2">[488]</span></a> -<br />
					all feelings -<br />
					all perception -<br />
					all plastic forces -<br />
					all consciousness -<br />
					everything by which the truth-finder might be denoted<br />
					has passed away for him, -<br />
					grubbed and stubbed,<br />
					leaving only the bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree towered, -<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Profound,<br />
					measureless,<br />
					unfathomable,<br />
					is the truth-finder<br />
					even as the mighty ocean;<br />
					reborn does not apply to him<br />
					nor not-reborn<br />
					nor any combination of such terms;<br />
					everything by which the truth-finder might be denoted,<br />
					has passed away for him,<br />
					utterly and for ever.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the close of these words,<br />
					the Wanderer Vaccha-gotta said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a giant Sal-tree<br />
					on the outskirts of a village or township<br />
					which, by the course of change,<br />
					loses its leaves and foliage,<br />
					sheds its bark and rotten stuff and poorer wood,<br />
					so that in time,<br />
					when all that is gone,<br />
					it stands in the clean strength of its choice timber alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					quite wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what had been hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or <a id="pt489" href="../../pali/mn/mn.071.pali.bd.htm#pg489"><span class="f2">[489]</span></a> bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure,<br />
					has Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the reverend Gotama I come as my refuge,<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask him to accept me as a disciple<br />
					from this day forth while life lasts.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>
