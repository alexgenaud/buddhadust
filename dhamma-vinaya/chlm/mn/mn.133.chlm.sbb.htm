					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Tapoda (hot springs) pleasaunce<br />
					the reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					rising up at daybreak,<br />
					be took him to the hot springs<br />
					to bathe his limbs,<br />
					and, having come out of the water,<br />
					was standing in a single garment drying himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To him came a deity <a id="pg264"><span class="f2 g"><b>[264]</b></span></a> of surpassing beauty<br />
					who, as night waned, illumined all the place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Standing to one side,<br />
					the deity asked Samiddhi whether he knew by heart<br />
					the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir, I do not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Almsman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you know the verses?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir, I do not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, Almsman.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Like you, I do not know the verses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Study, learn and master that exposition<br />
					and analysis of the True Saint, Almsman;<br />
					it is fruitful for good<br />
					and is fundamental for the higher life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With these words<br />
					the deity vanished from sight.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When night had passed away,<br />
					Samiddhi went to the Lord<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he related all that passed between him and the deity,<br />
					<a id="pt193" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg193"><span class="f2">[193]</span></a> ending with the request<br />
					that the Lord would teach him<br />
					the exposition and analysis of the True Saint.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Listen then and pay attention, Almsman,<br />
					and I will speak,<br />
					said the Lord,<br />
					who spoke as follows:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>
							
					<p class="f4">At this point the Blessed One arose and went to his cell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He had not been gone long<br />
					when the Almsmen,<br />
					realizing that the Lord had left them with a terse utterance<br />
					without expository presentment<br />
					and without elucidation of import<br />
					and wondering who could furnish them<br />
					with the exposition and the elucidation,<br />
					<a id="pt194" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg194"><span class="f2">[194]</span></a> bethought them that here was the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna<br />
					who was held in great honour and esteem<br />
					alike by the Master and by his fellows in the higher life,<br />
					and who could elucidate the meaning<br />
					of the Lord's terse utter- <a id="pg265"><span class="f2 g"><b>[265]</b></span></a> ance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they went to him<br />
					and after greetings<br />
					told him how the Lord had left them<br />
					with that terse utterance<br />
					and that, after he had so left them,<br />
					they had decided to turn to the Elder<br />
					for its elucidation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said he: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This proceeding is just like a man<br />
					in need and quest of choice timber,<br />
					who, as he hunts around for it,<br />
					comes on a fine upstanding timber-tree,<br />
					<a id="pt195" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg195"><span class="f2">[195]</span></a> but passes over<br />
					both the root and the trunk<br />
					and imagines he will find what he wants<br />
					in the boughs and the twiggage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Although the Master is present among you,<br />
					yet, disregarding the Lord,<br />
					you imagine me to be the person to ask<br />
					for the explanation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord, sirs, knows with all knowing<br />
					and sees with all seeing;<br />
					is the embodiment of vision,<br />
					of knowledge,<br />
					of the Doctrine,<br />
					and of all excellence;<br />
					is the propounder,<br />
					expounder<br />
					and the unfolder of meanings;<br />
					is the giver of Nirvana's ambrosia,<br />
					is lord of the Doctrine,<br />
					is the Truth-finder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Clearly, now is the time<br />
					to ask your questions of the Lord in person,<br />
					with intent to treasure up what he may reveal.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Admitting this, the Almsmen still pressed on the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna<br />
					their request that he would expound and elucidate.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Consenting, he spoke as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord's pregnant utterance was:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Let past be past; nor future longings house;<br />
							- the past is dead, the morrow not yet born.<br />
							Whoso with insight scans his heart to-day,<br />
							let him ensue eternal Changelessness!<br />
							Toil then to-day. To-morrow death may come,<br />
							- who knows? No bargain holds death's hosts at bay.<br />
							Whoso, by night and day unceasingly,<br />
							lives still to struggle onward, he it is<br />
							is called True Saint; - the Perfect Sage is he.</p>
							
					<p class="f4">I take the detailed meaning<br />
					of this pregnant utterance to be as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, Almsmen, does a man hark back to the past? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the thought that in the past<br />
					such and such was his eye,<br />
					such and such were <a id="pt196" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg196"><span class="f2">[196]</span></a> the visible shapes he saw,<br />
					his mentality becomes enchained<br />
					by the incitements of passion, -<br />
					which makes him delight therein<br />
					and thereby hark back to the past.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same is equally true<br />
					of ear<br />
					and smell [sic. nose],<br />
					of taste<br />
					touch<br />
					and mind,<br />
					and of their several objects respectively.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a man not hark back? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By keeping his <a id="pg266"><span class="f2 g"><b>[266]</b></span></a> mentality<br />
					un-chained by the incitements of passion<br />
					due to such memories.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a man have longings for the future? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the thought that<br />
					in the future his eye may be such and such,<br />
					and that such and such may be<br />
					the visible shapes he will see,<br />
					he turns his heart<br />
					to getting something he has not got, -<br />
					which makes him delignt therein<br />
					and thereby have longings for the future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same is equally true<br />
					of ear<br />
					and smell,<br />
					of taste<br />
					touch<br />
					and mind,<br />
					and of their several objects respectively.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt197" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg197"><span class="f2">[197]</span></a> How does a man<br />
					not have longings for the future? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By not turning his heart<br />
					to any such aspirations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is a man swept away<br />
					by present states of consciousness?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eye and visible shape<br />
					are both of the present,<br />
					and it is just with this present<br />
					that his mentality becomes enchained<br />
					by the incitements of passion,<br />
					- which makes him delight therein<br />
					and thereby fail to stand firm in the present.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same is equally true<br />
					of ear<br />
					and smell,<br />
					of taste<br />
					touch<br />
					and mind,<br />
					and of their several objects respectively.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is a man not swept away<br />
					by present states of consciousness? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By keeping his mentality un-chained<br />
					by the incitements of passion<br />
					due to such memories.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt198" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg198"><span class="f2">[198]</span></a> This then, said he in conclusion,<br />
					is my exposition and elucidation<br />
					of this terse utterance of the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Should your reverences be in any doubt,<br />
					you should go to him and ask him,<br />
					treasuring up in your memories what he may reveal.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, with grateful thanks to the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					those Almsmen betook them to the Lord,<br />
					to whom they first related <a id="pt199" href="../../pali/mn/mn.133.pali.bd.htm#pg199"><span class="f2">[199]</span></a> how they had sought<br />
					for an exposition and elucidation<br />
					of that terse utterance of the Lord<br />
					from the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					and then narrated how he had expounded it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Learned, Almsmen,<br />
					is Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					rich in lore.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Had you asked me,<br />
					I should have said just the same;<br />
					for, this is the precise meaning,<br />
					which you should treasure up in your memories accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord. Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
