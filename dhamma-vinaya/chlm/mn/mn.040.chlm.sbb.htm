<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 40. The Buddha explains the unreasonableness of such superficial practices as the wearing of robes, going naked, living in filth, ceremonial bathing, living at the root of a tree, eating according to a set regimin, chanting, or wearing matted hair in the hope of ridding one's self of malevolence, wrath, grudge-bearing, hypocrisy, spite, jealousy, stingyness, treachery, craftyness, evil desires and wrong views. Then he explains the manner in which practicing friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment rids one of those bad characteristics and leads on to attaining arahantship." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying in the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rd_angas">Angas'</a> country,<br />
					where they have a township named <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#assapura">Assapura,</a><br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Recluses! -<br />
					that is the name by which people know you<br />
					and by which you would describe yourselves,<br />
					if asked who you were.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such being your vocation<br />
					and profession<br />
					as recluses, you must train yourselves<br />
					to embrace and shew forth in your lives<br />
					the recluse's path of duty,<br />
					so as to prove your vocation true<br />
					and your profession a reality,<br />
					and to see to it<br />
					that the charity you enjoy<br />
					in the shape of clothing and food and other requisites<br />
					enures to fruit and profit in yourselves,<br />
					making your Pilgrimage not barren<br />
					but fruitful unto its harvest.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does an Almsman not tread the recluses path of duty?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman who is greedy<br />
					and has not put greed from him,<br />
					or who is malicious of heart<br />
					and has not put malice from him,<br />
					or who is wrathful<br />
					and has not put wrath from him,<br />
					or who is revengeful<br />
					and has not put revenge from him,<br />
					or who is a hypocrite<br />
					and has not put hypocrisy from him,<br />
					or is fraudulent<br />
					and has not put fraud from him,<br />
					or who is jealous<br />
					and has not put jealousy from him,<br />
					or who is a niggard<br />
					and has not put niggardliness from him,<br />
					or who is treacherous<br />
					and has not put treachery from him,<br />
					or who is deceitful<br />
					and has not put deceit from him,<br />
					or whose desires are evil<br />
					nor has he put evil desires from him,<br />
					or who is wrong in his outlook<br />
					and has not put wrong outlooks from him, -<br />
					of such an Almsman<br />
					I say that he fails to tread the recluse's path of duty,<br />
					because <a id="pg200"><span class="f2 g"><b>[200]</b></span></a> he has not put from him<br />
					these dispositions<br />
					which are blots<br />
					and blemishes<br />
					and defects<br />
					in a recluse,<br />
					leading to woe hereafter<br />
					and to a doom of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if,<br />
					hidden away<br />
					and concealed beneath his robes,<br />
					the Brother had got a deadly stiletto,<br />
					two-edged and whetted keen; -<br />
					unto this do I liken that Almsman's Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">I say it is not the robe which makes the recluse,<br />
					nor nakedness,<br />
					nor dust and dirt,<br />
					nor bathing thrice a day,<br />
					nor living under a tree,<br />
					nor living in the open,<br />
					nor never sitting down,<br />
					nor punctilio in regimen,<br />
					nor intoning texts,<br />
					nor a shock head of matted hair.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the mere wearing of the robe<br />
					could banish greed,<br />
					malice,<br />
					and so forth,<br />
					then, as soon as a child was born,<br />
					his friends and kinsfolk would make him wear the robe<br />
					and would press him to wear it, saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, thou favoured of fortune!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, wear the robe;<br />
					for, by the mere wearing of it,<br />
					the greedy will put from them their greed,<br />
					the malicious their malice, ...<br />
					and those of wrong outlook will put from them their wrong outlook. -</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because I see robe-wearers<br />
					who are greedy and malicious ...<br />
					and wrong in their outlook,<br />
					that I say the mere wearing of the robe<br />
					does not make the recluse.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similar paragraphs about nakedness, dust and dirt ... shock head of matted hair.]</p>

					<p class="f4">How, on the other hand,<br />
					does an Almsman tread the recluse's path of duty?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman who is not greedy<br />
					but has put greed from him,<br />
					who is not malicious<br />
					but has put malice from him ...<br />
					who is not wrong in outlook<br />
					but has put wrong outlooks from him, -<br />
					of such an Almsman<br />
					I say that he succeeds<br />
					in treading the recluse's path of duty,<br />
					because he has put from him<br />
					those dispositions which are blots<br />
					and blemishes<br />
					and defects<br />
					in a recluse,<br />
					leading to woe hereafter<br />
					and a doom of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman realizes<br />
					that he is cleansed and Delivered<br />
					from all those evil and wrong states of consciousness;<br />
					when he realizes this,<br />
					there is bred in him gladness of heart,<br />
					which in turn breeds zest,<br />
					which brings tranquillity to <a id="pg201"><span class="f2 g"><b>[201]</b></span></a> the body,<br />
					which inspires those feelings of satisfaction<br />
					whereby the heart wins rapt concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells with radiant thoughts of good-will<br />
					pervading first one quarter of the world -<br />
					then the second -<br />
					then the third -<br />
					and then the fourth quarter;<br />
					he dwells with radiant good-will<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					and everywhere, -<br />
					with radiant good-will all-embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					wherein no hate or malice finds a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with good-will, so, in turn,<br />
					with radiant compassion,<br />
					sympathy,<br />
					and poised equanimity,<br />
					does he pervade the whole length and breadth of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a lake of clear bright water,<br />
					limpid,<br />
					easy to get down to,<br />
					and in every way delightful;<br />
					and as if from the east -<br />
					or the west -<br />
					or from the north -<br />
					or from the south -<br />
					there should come a man<br />
					overcome and Overpowered with the blazing heat of summer,<br />
					exhausted and beside himself with thirst,<br />
					who should quench in that lake's waters<br />
					the thirst and the fever which parched his frame; -<br />
					just in the same way,<br />
					if a noble -<br />
					or a brahmin -<br />
					or a middle-class man -<br />
					or a peasant -<br />
					leaving his home for homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and coming to the Doctrine and Rule preached by the Truth-finder,<br />
					so develops good-will,<br />
					compassion,<br />
					sympathy<br />
					and poised equanimity<br />
					as to win inward peace,<br />
					then, by reason of his winning such inward peace,<br />
					he - say I - treads the recluse's path of duty.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a noble -<br />
					Or a brahmin -<br />
					Or a middle-class man -<br />
					Or a peasant -<br />
					leaves home for hOmelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					and if he, by extirpating the Cankers,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					that Deliverance of heart and mind,<br />
					from Cankers free,<br />
					which he has of and for himself<br />
					discerned and realized here and now, -<br />
					then he becomes a recluse<br />
					by the extirpation of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
