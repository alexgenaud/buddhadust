					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan pleasaunce,<br />
					early in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					he went for alms into the city<br />
					and on his return after his meal<br />
					betook himself to rest<br />
					during the noontide heat<br />
					at the cell erected in that pleasaunce<br />
					by Kāḷa-Khemaka the Sakyan.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time<br />
					a number of pallets had been got ready there<br />
					and at the sight <a id="pt110" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg110"><span class="f2">[110]</span></a> of these<br />
					the Lord wondered whether there were a number of Almsmen in residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time the reverendĀnanda<br />
					with a number of Almsmen<br />
					was engaged on robe-making<br />
					at the (neighbouring) cell<br />
					erected by Ghaṭāya the Sakyan, -<br />
					whither, when he rose from his meditations towards evening,<br />
					the Lord betook himself,<br />
					enquiring, as he took the seat set for him,<br />
					whether the number of pallets at Kāḷa-Khemaka's cell<br />
					betokened a number of Almsmen in residence there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, wasĀnanda's answer; -<br />
					it is robe-making time.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman, Ānanda,<br />
					does not shine by delighting in fellowship,<br />
					by finding delight in fellowship<br />
					or by being given to a delight in fellowship;<br />
					nor does he shine<br />
					by a like delight in company at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">If such be his delight,<br />
					it is impossible that,<br />
					at will and without trouble or difficulty,<br />
					he should enjoy the well-being<br />
					which attends Renunciation,<br />
					solitude,<br />
					tranquillity<br />
					and Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, any Almsman who lives aloof from company<br />
					may be expected to enjoy all this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, if an Almsman<br />
					delights in fellowship and company,<br />
					it is impossible that,<br />
					at will and without trouble or difficulty,<br />
					he should develop,<br />
					and dwell in,<br />
					Deliverance of heart<br />
					whether <a id="ptIll" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pgIll"><span class="f2">[Ill]</span></a> as a passing joy<br />
					or as an enduring possession.</p>

					<p class="f4">But any Almsman<br />
					who lives aloof from company<br />
					may be expected to enjoy all <a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> this.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a single visible shape<br />
					do I discern, Ānanda,<br />
					delight in which<br />
					does not entail,<br />
					with that shape's change and alteration,<br />
					sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					ills<br />
					and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder has become fully aware of this state,<br />
					namely how, in dismissing thoughts of all attendant phenomena,<br />
					to develop and dwell in true emptiness within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein, Ānanda, if, so dwelling,<br />
					the Truth-finder is approached by Almsmen<br />
					or Alms-women,<br />
					by lay-disciples male or female,<br />
					by kings or their ministers,<br />
					by sectaries or their followers, -<br />
					then it is with a heart that is set on solitude,<br />
					that trends to solitude<br />
					and finds a fastness in solitude,<br />
					it is with a heart that is aloof,<br />
					that finds its joy in renunciation of the world,<br />
					and has laid low each and every disposition<br />
					which is bred of Cankers,<br />
					it is with such a heart<br />
					that, being in company,<br />
					he frames his speech<br />
					so as to be left alone once more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, if an Almsman's desire<br />
					is to develop and dwell in true emptiness within,<br />
					he should calm,<br />
					tranquillize,<br />
					focus<br />
					and concentrate his heart internally.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he to accomplish this? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, divested of lusts and of wrong dispositions,<br />
					successively develops and dwells in the Four Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way he calms,<br />
					tranquillizes,<br />
					focusses<br />
					and concentrates his heart internally.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt112" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2">[112]</span></a> Suppose now that his mind ponders on internal emptiness,<br />
					but that, as he does so,<br />
					his heart does not go forth to it,<br />
					to find satisfaction therein<br />
					or a foothold<br />
					or Deliverance,<br />
					and that ultimately he recognizes<br />
					and consciously realizes<br />
					this inward verdict and finding, -<br />
					with the same thing happening<br />
					with regard to external emptiness,<br />
					to both internal and external emptiness,<br />
					and to Permanence;<br />
					always the same verdict.</p>

					<p class="f4">What that Almsman has to do<br />
					is (to persevere in his efforts)<br />
					to calm,<br />
					focus<br />
					and concentrate his heart<br />
					internally on the same old theme of concentration<br />
					till - for both internal and external emptiness<br />
					and for Permanence -<br />
					the inward verdict and finding is reversed<br />
					and his heart goes forth to emptiness,<br />
					finding therein satisfaction,<br />
					a foothold<br />
					and Deliverance;<br />
					<a id="pg219"><span class="f2 g"><b>[219]</b></span></a> and ultimately he recognizes<br />
					and consciously realizes<br />
					this verdict of satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, living in this plane,<br />
					he applies his mind - say -<br />
					to pacing up and down,<br />
					he does so with the conscious conviction<br />
					that, as in his present state<br />
					he paces up and down,<br />
					no covetousness and discontent,<br />
					no dispositions that are evil and wrong<br />
					will <a id="pt113" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg113"><span class="f2">[113]</span></a> assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The same conviction is his<br />
					if, while living in this plane,<br />
					he applies his mind to standing still<br />
					and stands still, -<br />
					or sits down, -<br />
					or lies down;<br />
					he is conscious<br />
					that now he will not be assailed<br />
					by covetousness and discontent<br />
					or by dispositions that are evil and wrong.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while living in this plane,<br />
					the Almsman applies his mind to speech,<br />
					he is conscious that his tongue<br />
					will utter nothing that is low<br />
					rustic<br />
					and vulgar,<br />
					nothing that is not noble<br />
					or not profitable,<br />
					nothing that fails to conduce to aversion,<br />
					passipnlessness,<br />
					stilling,<br />
					peace,<br />
					illumination,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					nothing by way of talk of princes,<br />
					bandits,<br />
					great lords,<br />
					armies,<br />
					terrors,<br />
					battles,<br />
					meat and drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					relations,<br />
					carriages,<br />
					villages,<br />
					townships,<br />
					cities,<br />
					countries,<br />
					women,<br />
					heroes' prowess,<br />
					gossip at street-corners or at wells,<br />
					tales of kinsfolk departed,<br />
					other chatter,<br />
					and fables about the origin of the world and the ocean<br />
					and about the rise and fall of things.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is conscious on the contrary<br />
					that his speech will be grave and heart-opening,<br />
					conducing to absolute aversion,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to stilling,<br />
					peace,<br />
					illumination,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					namely talk of wanting little<br />
					and being contented,<br />
					solitude,<br />
					withdrawal from the world,<br />
					strenuous endeavour,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					understanding,<br />
					Deliverance,<br />
					and clear vision of Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, while living in this plane,<br />
					the Almsman <a id="pt114" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg114"><span class="f2">[114]</span></a> applies his mind to thinking,<br />
					he is conscious that his thoughts<br />
					will not be low<br />
					rustic<br />
					and vulgar,<br />
					not noble and not profitable,<br />
					conducing not to aversion,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					stilling,<br />
					peace,<br />
					illumination,<br />
					enlightenment and Nirvana;<br />
					he is conscious that his thoughts<br />
					will not be <a id="pg220"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></a> thoughts of lust,<br />
					malevolence and injury,<br />
					but will on the contrary be thoughts<br />
					that are noble and saving,<br />
					that guide him who lives up to them<br />
					to the extinction of all Ill, -<br />
					such as thoughts of renunciation<br />
					and benevolence<br />
					and innocency.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five strands, Ānanda,<br />
					make up the pleasures of sense, - namely,<br />
					visible shapes,<br />
					sounds,<br />
					odours,<br />
					tastes<br />
					and touch,<br />
					all of them pleasant and agreeable and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with passion and lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therein an Almsman must constantly search his heart<br />
					to see whether, in this or that relation,<br />
					his heart is coming to have traffic<br />
					with these pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">If his search tells him<br />
					that such traffic is about,<br />
					then he becomes conscious<br />
					that he has not yet made an end<br />
					of the seductions of such pleasures;<br />
					but if his search tells him<br />
					there is no such traffic about,<br />
					he becomes conscious<br />
					that these seductions are ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Five in number, Ānanda,<br />
					are the factors of attachment,<br />
					which must engage an Almsman<br />
					who ponders on the rise and fall of things, - namely,<br />
					form,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					plastic forces<br />
					and consciousness,<br />
					<a id="pt115" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg115"><span class="f2">[115]</span></a> together with the arising and the passing<br />
					of each of the five.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he so ponders,<br />
					all pride of personality in these five factors<br />
					quits him<br />
					and he is conscious that he is quit of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The foregoing states of consciousness, Ānanda,<br />
					ensure an absolutely right future<br />
					and are noble,<br />
					transcendent,<br />
					and beyond the clutches of Māra,<br />
					the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">On what grounds ought a disciple<br />
					to dog his master's footsteps<br />
					even though hounded away?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord, sir, is the root,<br />
					the channel<br />
					and the refuge<br />
					of all our doctrines.</p>

					<p class="f4">We pray that the Lord<br />
					may be moved to declare the meaning<br />
					of what he has said,<br />
					so that the Almsmen may treasure up<br />
					what falls from his lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">The disciple ought not to dog his master's footsteps<br />
					for the interpretation of canonical scriptures.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why not? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Because from of old<br />
					their doctrines have been heard,<br />
					learned by heart,<br />
					garnered by recital,<br />
 					<a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> 					turned over and over in the mind<br />
					and fathomed by vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">No; he should persist in dogging his master's footsteps perforce,<br />
					solely to hear words that are grave and heart-opening,<br />
					conducing to absolute aversion,<br />
					to passionlessness,<br />
					to stilling,<br />
					peace,<br />
					illumination,<br />
					enlightenment and Nirvana, - namely,<br />
					words about wanting little,<br />
					about contentment,<br />
					solitude,<br />
					withdrawal from the world,<br />
					strenuous endeavour,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					understanding,<br />
					Deliverance<br />
					and clear vision of Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus comes affliction of master and of pupil,<br />
					and affliction in living the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">How comes the master's affliction? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a master<br />
					who chooses out a solitary lodging -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground <a id="pt116" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg116"><span class="f2">[116]</span></a>,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he lives aloof thus,<br />
					he is visited by a constant stream of brahmins and householders,<br />
					of townsfolk and countryfolk;<br />
					and infatuations hankerings and covetise grow upon him,<br />
					so that he is a backslider to luxury.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is an afflicted master who,<br />
					in his affliction<br />
					is laid low by evil and wrong dispositions<br />
					that are vicious and entail re-birth,<br />
					are fraught with anguish,<br />
					and ripen to Ill,<br />
					with a heritage of birth,<br />
					old-age and death in their train.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the affliction of a master;<br />
					and exactly the same is the affliction<br />
					which comes on that master's pupil<br />
					who devotes himself to solitude<br />
					after his master's example<br />
					and chooses out his solitary lodging -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he lives aloof thus,<br />
					he is visited by a constant stream of brahmins and householders,<br />
					of townsfolk and countryfolk;<br />
					and infatuations hankerings and covetise grow upon him,<br />
					so that he is a backslider to luxury.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is an afflicted pupil who,<br />
					in his affliction<br />
					is laid low by evil and wrong dispositions<br />
					that are vicious and entail re-birth,<br />
					are fraught with anguish,<br />
					and ripen to Ill,<br />
					with a heritage of birth,<br />
					old-age and death in their train.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the pupil's affliction.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is affliction in living the higher life? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose there appears in the world a Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					... Lord of Enlightenment,<br />
					who chooses out his solitary lodging<br />
					and there in his life aloof<br />
					is visited by a constant stream of visitors;<br />
					yet infatuations hankerings and covetise<br />
					never grow upon him<br />
					nor <a id="pt117" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg117"><span class="f2">[117]</span></a> is he ever a backslider to luxury.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this Master's pupil,<br />
					devoting himself to solitude<br />
					after his Master's example,<br />
					chooses out his solitary lodging<br />
					where in his life aloof<br />
					he is visited by a constant stream of visitors;<br />
					and infatuations hankerings and covetise <a id="pg222"><span class="f2 g"><b>[222]</b></span></a> grow upon him,<br />
					so that he is a backslider to luxury.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such, Ānanda,<br />
					is what is termed<br />
					affliction in living the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is such affliction,<br />
					whether of master or of pupil,<br />
					which more than aught else<br />
					proves their affliction<br />
					in living the higher life<br />
					which ripens to Ill<br />
					and exceeding bitterness<br />
					and conduces to woe hereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, comport yourselves towards me<br />
					in a spirit of friendliness<br />
					not of hostility,<br />
					and it will prove your lasting happiness and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, how do disciples comport themselves towards their master<br />
					in a spirit of hostility<br />
					and not of friendliness? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a master<br />
					who out of compassion and affection<br />
					preaches his Doctrine to his disciples<br />
					in a spirit of compassion<br />
					to ensure their happiness and welfare,<br />
					but whose disciples do not listen<br />
					or give ear<br />
					or try to learn,<br />
					but turn away from his teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the spirit of hostility to a master.</p>

					<p class="f4">The spirit of friendliness is shown<br />
					when his disciples listen,<br />
					give ear<br />
					and try to learn,<br />
					and turn not from his teachings,<br />
					as he seeks to ensure their happiness and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt118" href="../../pali/mn/mn.122.pali.bd.htm#pg118"><span class="f2">[118]</span></a> Therefore, Ānanda,<br />
					comport yourselves towards me<br />
					in a spirit not of hostility<br />
					but of friendliness;<br />
					and it will prove your lasting happiness and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not deal with you<br />
					as the potter with mere wet clay.</p>

					<p class="f4">I shall speak to you with constant admonishings<br />
					and with constant eradication of faults; -<br />
					that which is excellent will stand fast.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
