					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at among the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vajjians">Vajjians</a> at Ukka-cela on the banks of the Ganges, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days<br />
					an incompetent herdsman of Magadha,<br />
					in autumn when it was the very last month of the rainy season,<br />
					without considering either the hither or the further shore of the Ganges,<br />
					started - from where there was no ford at all -<br />
					to drive his cattle across to the Videha side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Huddled together in midstream,<br />
					they came there to trouble and disaster, -<br />
					all because of this incompetence of the herdsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with any recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are wrong about this world and the hereafter,<br />
					wrong about what is and what is not the realm of Māra,<br />
					wrong about what is and what is not the realm of <a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> Death; -<br />
					all who imagine they ought to hearken to,<br />
					and trust in,<br />
					such recluses and brahmins,<br />
					will long suffer and smart for it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days,<br />
					a competent herdsman of Magadha,<br />
					in autumn when it was the very last month of the rainy season,<br />
					after due scrutiny of both the hither and the further shores of the Ganges,<br />
					started - from where there was a ford -<br />
					to drive his cattle across to the Videha side.</p>

					<p class="f4">First of all he drove over the bulls,<br />
					the sires and leaders of the herd,<br />
					who crossed the stream to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next he drove over the sturdy steers and cows,<br />
					who also crossed the stream to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he drove over the half-grown bull-calves<br />
					and heifers,<br />
					who also crossed the stream to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he drove over the weaker calves,<br />
					who also crossed the stream to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">In those bygone days<br />
					there was a tiny new-born bull-calf,<br />
					which, helped along by the lowing of its mother,<br />
					also crossed the stream to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that competent herdsman of Magadha<br />
					had carefully considered both banks<br />
					before he drove his herd across the stream of the Ganges.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with any recluses or brahmins<br />
					who are right about this world<br />
					and about the hereafter,<br />
					right about what is and what is not the realm of Māra,<br />
					right about what is and what is not the realm of Death; -<br />
					all who imagine they ought to hearken to,<br />
					and trust in,<br />
					these recluses and brahmins,<br />
					will long enjoy weal and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as those bulls,<br />
					sires and leaders of the herd,<br />
					crossed the stream of the Ganges to the further shore in safety,<br />
					so too those Almsmen who are Arahats,<br />
					in whom the Cankers are no more,<br />
					who have greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have cast off their burthens,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					and who, fettered no more to existence,<br />
					have by utter knowledge won Deliverance, -<br />
					these have crossed the stream of Māra<br />
					to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just too as those sturdy steers and cows<br />
					crossed the stream of the Ganges in <a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[l6l]</b></span></a> safety,<br />
					so also those Almsmen who,<br />
					having destroyed the Five Fetters of this world,<br />
					will be translated hereafter<br />
					to realms from which they will never be reborn to earth, -<br />
					these too will cross the stream of Māra<br />
					to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just too as the half-grown bull-calves<br />
					and heifers<br />
					crossed the stream of the Ganges<br />
					to the further shore in safety,<br />
					so also those Almsmen who,<br />
					having destroyed the Three Fetters<br />
					and having reduced passion,<br />
					hate<br />
					and folly<br />
					to a minimum,<br />
					will return but once more to this world<br />
					and then will make an end of Ill; -<br />
					these too will cross the stream of Māra<br />
					to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just too as those weaker calves<br />
					crossed the stream of the Ganges<br />
					to the further shore in safety,<br />
					so also those Almsmen who,<br />
					having destroyed the Three Fetters<br />
					and entered the stream,<br />
					will escape all future states of misery,<br />
					possess an assured future,<br />
					and are destined to win Enlightenment; -<br />
					these too will cross the stream of Māra<br />
					to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just too as that tiny new-born bull-calf,<br />
					helped along by the lowing of its mother,<br />
					crossed the stream of the Ganges<br />
					to the further shore in safety,<br />
					so also those Almsmen who live in accord with the Doctrine<br />
					and trust therein, -<br />
					these too will cross the stream of Māra<br />
					to the further shore in safety.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is I, Almsmen,<br />
					who am right about this world<br />
					and about the hereafter,<br />
					it is I who am right about what is and what is not the realm of Māra,<br />
					it is I who am right about what is and what is not the realm of Death.</p>

					<p class="f4">All who imagine they ought to hearken to,<br />
					and trust in, me,<br />
					will long enjoy weal and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord;<br />
					and when the Blessed One had thus spoken<br />
					he went on, as the Master, to say this:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>This world and worlds beyond, where Māra reigns<br />
							and where Death comes not, - this I knew andpreached;<br />
							in utter knowledge and Enlightenment,<br />
							I oped Nirvana's door of deathless peace.<br />
							At last o'er Māra's stream, death's roots uptorn,<br />
							- rejoice! rejoice! Nirvana's peace is won!</i></p>
