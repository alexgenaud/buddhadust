<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 22. A wide-ranging very famous sutta that begins with a forceful teaching on the dangers of indulgence in sense pleasures. This sutta contains two famous similies: the similie of the snake illustrating how a wrong grasp of the Dhamma is like taking hold of a poisonous snake from the wrong end; and the simile of the raft illustrating how the Dhamma should be used to attain it's ends and then be let go. The sutta concludes with a thorough examination of the way 'not self' should be considered." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					an Almsman named Ariṭṭha who had originally been a vulture-catcher<br />
					had come to hold the pernicious heresy that,<br />
					as he understood the Lord's exposition of the Doctrine,<br />
					the states of mind declared by the Lord<br />
					to be the stumbling-blocks<br />
					are not such at all<br />
					to him who indulges in them.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> As soon as this reached their ears,<br />
					a number of Almsmen went to ask Ariṭṭha<br />
					whether he was correctly reported<br />
					as holding a heresy so pernicious;<br />
					and, on learning from him<br />
					that he undoubtedly did hold it,<br />
					they sought to wean him from it<br />
					by enquiry,<br />
					expostulation,<br />
					and remonstrance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not, said they,<br />
					misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					it is not right<br />
					to impute this to him,<br />
					for he would not say so;<br />
					(on the contrary) it has been by the Lord<br />
					laid down in many a figure<br />
					that the states of mind<br />
					declared by him to be stumbling-blocks<br />
					are veritable stumbling-blocks<br />
					to him who indulges in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures of sense<br />
					he has described as giving little satisfaction,<br />
					much Ill<br />
					and much tribulation,<br />
					and as being dogged by perils greater still.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has described these pleasures of sense<br />
					in the (ten) Parables,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					of the bare bone,<br />
					the lump of carrion,<br />
					the hay-torch,<br />
					the pit of embers,<br />
					the dream,<br />
					the loan,<br />
					the hanging fruit,<br />
					the slaughter-house,<br />
					the impaling stake,<br />
					the snake's head, -<br />
					always as giving little satisfaction,<br />
					much Ill,<br />
					and much tribulation,<br />
					and always as being dogged by perils greater still.</p>

					<p class="f4">But say what they might,<br />
					Ariṭṭha would not yield to their expostulations<br />
					but stoutly maintained<br />
					and upheld<br />
					his pernicious heresy.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, when Ariṭṭha could not be got to recede from his position,<br />
					those Almsmen went to the Lord<br />
					and recounted all that passed;<br />
					and he sent an Almsman to summon Ariṭṭha to his presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When Ariṭṭha had obediently come<br />
					and had taken his seat to one side after due obeisance,<br />
					the Lord asked him whether he was correctly reported<br />
					as having come to hold that,<br />
					as he understood the Doctrine taught by the Lord,<br />
					the states of mind declared to be stumbling-blocks<br />
					were not such at all<br />
					to him who indulged in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he undoubtedly did so hold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">To whom, foolish man,<br />
					do you aver that I ever so taught the Doctrine?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have I not <a id="pg92"><span class="f2 g"><b>[92]</b></span></a> foolish man,<br />
					laid it down in many a figure<br />
					that the states of mind declared by me to be stumbling-blocks<br />
					are veritable stumbling-blocks<br />
					to him who indulges in them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasures of sense I have described<br />
					as giving little satisfaction,<br />
					much Ill,<br />
					and much tribulation,<br />
					and as being dogged by perils greater still;<br />
					I have so described pleasures of sense in ten Parables.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet you, foolish man,<br />
					employ what you yourself misunderstand<br />
					not only to misrepresent me<br />
					but also to undermine yourself<br />
					and to lay up a store of demerit, -<br />
					to your lasting hurt and harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning then to the Almsmen,<br />
					the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think this Brother Ariṭṭha,<br />
					the vulture-catcher of the past,<br />
					has got even a spark of illumination<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule?</p>

					<p class="f4">How could he, sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">For, it is not the fact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereat, Ariṭṭha sat silent and glum,<br />
					with his shoulders hunched up<br />
					and eyes downcast,<br />
					much exercised in his mind<br />
					but finding no words to utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Marking his plight,<br />
					the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, foolish man,<br />
					you shall be shewn up<br />
					in respect of this pernicious view;<br />
					I will question the Almsmen on the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Whilom. OE: hwil, hwilum &gt; a-time, a-while. 'at one time', 'once', 'formerly'.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Now do you too, Almsmen,<br />
					understand me to have taught the Doctrine<br />
					in the fashion in which Ariṭṭha here,<br />
					this whilom vulture-catcher,<br />
					employs what he himself misunderstands,<br />
					not only to misrepresent me<br />
					but also to undermine himself<br />
					and to lay up a store of demerit?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					for, in many a figure<br />
					we have heard from the Lord<br />
					that the states of mind declared by him to be stumbling-blocks<br />
					are veritable stumbling-blocks<br />
					to him who indulges in them;<br />
					pleasures of sense the Lord<br />
					has described as giving little satisfaction,<br />
					much Ill,<br />
					and much tribulation,<br />
					and as being dogged by perils greater still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen;<br />
					you rightly understand my teaching;<br />
					for, indeed, I have, as you say,<br />
					so taught in many a figure and parable.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet here is this former vulture-catcher, Ariṭṭha,<br />
					employing what he himself <a id="pg93"><span class="f2 g"><b>[93]</b></span></a> misunderstands,<br />
					not only to misrepresent me<br />
					but also to undermine himself<br />
					and to lay up a store of demerit, -<br />
					to his lasting hurt and Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">No one can possibly indulge in pleasures of sense<br />
					without harbouring sensuality within himself<br />
					or without perceiving it<br />
					and thinking about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of some foolish persons<br />
					who have learned by heart the Doctrine, -<br />
					the Suttas<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> in prose<br />
					or in prose and verse,<br />
					with the Poems<br />
					and the Triumphant Utterances<br />
					and the Quotations<br />
					and the <i>Jātakas</i><br />
					and the Miracles<br />
					and the Miscellanies, -<br />
					yet, though they have learned it all by heart,<br />
					fail to study its import<br />
					for the comprehension of all it embodies,<br />
					and consequently find no joy in it,<br />
					profiting by their learning by rote<br />
					solely for strictures on others<br />
					or for bandying verbal quotations,<br />
					and quite missing the real object of their memorizing;<br />
					so that these divers aspects of the Doctrine<br />
					which they have failed to grasp<br />
					conduce to their lasting hurt and Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they have grasped it all wrong.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man who is in quest of a serpent for his needs<br />
					and who in the course of his searching<br />
					finds a big serpent,<br />
					which he seizes by its coils or tail,<br />
					with the result that it turns on him<br />
					and bites him on hand or arm<br />
					or elsewhere on his body,<br />
					so that he comes thereby<br />
					by his death<br />
					or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has wrongly grasped his snake.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just the same with those foolish persons<br />
					who have learned by heart ...<br />
					wrongly grasped them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the case of young men<br />
					who have likewise learned the Doctrine by heart<br />
					in all its aspects<br />
					but study its import<br />
					for the comprehension of all it embodies,<br />
					and consequently find joy in it, -<br />
					learning it <a id="pg94"><span class="f2 g"><b>[94]</b></span></a> by heart<br />
					not for strictures on others<br />
					or for bandying verbal quotations,<br />
					but for securing the real object of their memorizing,<br />
					so that the divers aspects of the Doctrine<br />
					which they have succeeded in mastering<br />
					conduce to their lasting good and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because they have grasped it all aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man who is in quest of a serpent for his needs<br />
					and who in the course of his searching<br />
					finds a big serpent<br />
					which he pins securely down with a forked stick<br />
					before grasping it tightly by its neck.</p>

					<p class="f4">Coil itself as the serpent may<br />
					round his hand<br />
					or arm<br />
					or other part of his body,<br />
					the man does not come thereby<br />
					by his death or deadly hurt.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because he has grasped it aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is just the same with those young men who have likewise learned by heart ...<br />
					grasped it all aright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, Almsmen, when you understand the import of what I say,<br />
					so treasure it up in your memories;<br />
					but if you fail to understand,<br />
					then ask me<br />
					or some outstanding Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">By the parable of the raft<br />
					I will teach how to abandon<br />
					and not to retain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir,<br />
					said they in response;<br />
					and the Lord began:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man<br />
					who after travelling a long way<br />
					finds the floods out,<br />
					with danger and peril on the hither side<br />
					and with security and safety on the further side,<br />
					but with no ferry or suspension-bridge;<br />
					and to him comes the thought<br />
					to win his way across the floods<br />
					to safety from the perils which encompass him<br />
					by collecting grass<br />
					and sticks<br />
					and branches<br />
					and boughs<br />
					wherewith to fashion a raft<br />
					on which to paddle himself safely across with his hands and feet;<br />
					and to him, when he has done all this<br />
					and has paddled himself safely across,<br />
					the thought comes<br />
					that the raft had been so useful<br />
					that he might do well to take it along with him<br />
					packed on his head or shoulders.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think you he would be doing the right thing with the raft?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">How should he act so as to do the right thing with his raft?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, suppose that,<br />
					when he was safely over,<br />
					he, recognizing how <a id="pg95"><span class="f2 g"><b>[95]</b></span></a> useful the raft had been,<br />
					were to deem it well,<br />
					before going on his way,<br />
					either to beach it<br />
					or to leave it afloat; -<br />
					clearly thus he would be doing the right thing with his raft.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this wise I have taught you<br />
					by the parable of the raft<br />
					how to abandon<br />
					and not to retain.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you understand this parable of the raft,<br />
					you have to discard good things,<br />
					and <i>à fortiori</i> bad things.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speculative tenets are sixfold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an uninstructed everyday man<br />
					who takes no count of the Noble,<br />
					who is unversed and untrained in the Doctrine of the Noble,<br />
					who takes no count of the Excellent, -<br />
					who is unversed in the Doctrine of the Excellent, -<br />
					who regards as 'mine' or<br />
					'I am this' or<br />
					'this is my Self,' either<br />
					(i) visible form, - or<br />
					(ii) feeling - or<br />
					(iii) perception - or<br />
					(iv) the plastic forces - or<br />
					(v) whatsoever he sees,<br />
					hears,<br />
					touches,<br />
					is aware of,<br />
					or by the mind attains,<br />
					seeks out,<br />
					and reflects on, - or<br />
					(vi) the speculative tenet that<br />
					'the world around me is the Self<br />
					which I shall hereafter become, -<br />
					eternal and permanent,<br />
					everlasting and unchangeable,<br />
					standing fast like heaven and earth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the instructed man,<br />
					the disciple of the Noble<br />
					who does take count of the Noble<br />
					and is both versed and trained in their Doctrine,<br />
					who does take count of the Excellent<br />
					and is both versed and trained in their Doctrine, -<br />
					he refuses to regard visible form -<br />
					or the rest of the six -<br />
					as mine or I am this, or this is my Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Refusing so to regard these things,<br />
					he is not worried over the non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point an Almsman asked<br />
					whether there could be worry<br />
					over the externally non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, answered the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a Brother thinks he once had something<br />
					which he now has not got,<br />
					or that he would like to have something<br />
					he cannot get;<br />
					he grieves and mourns and laments,<br />
					he beats his breast<br />
					and is distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how there comes worry<br />
					over the externally non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being asked further<br />
					if there could be an absence of worry<br />
					over the externally non-existent,<br />
					the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; suppose an Almsman never thinks<br />
					that <a id="pg96"><span class="f2 g"><b>[96]</b></span></a> he once had something<br />
					which he now has not got,<br />
					or that he would like to have something<br />
					he cannot get;<br />
					he does not grieve and mourn and lament,<br />
					he does not beat his breast<br />
					nor is he distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how there is an absence of worry<br />
					over the externally non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being asked further<br />
					if there could be worry<br />
					over the internally non-existent,<br />
					the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; as for instance<br />
					in the case of an Almsman<br />
					who comes to hold the speculative idea<br />
					that the world around me is the Self,<br />
					which I shall hereafter become, -<br />
					eternal and permanent,<br />
					everlasting and unchangeable,<br />
					standing fast like heaven and earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the Truth-finder<br />
					or a disciple of his<br />
					he hears preached the Doctrine to remove all tendency,<br />
					inclination,<br />
					and bias<br />
					towards speculative tenets,<br />
					to still all plastic forces,<br />
					to discard all the material of rebirth,<br />
					to extirpate cravings,<br />
					in the passionless calm of Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinks he to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then I shall be cut off<br />
					and perish utterly,<br />
					there will be an end of me for ever<br />
					and at the thought<br />
					he grieves and mourns and laments,<br />
					beats his breast,<br />
					and is distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how there is worry<br />
					over the internally non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being asked further<br />
					whether there could be an absence of worry<br />
					over the internally non-existent,<br />
					the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes; as for instance<br />
					in the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, holding no speculative idea<br />
					that the world around him is the Self,<br />
					into which he will hereafter merge for ever and ever,<br />
					hears the Doctrine preached by the Truth-finder<br />
					or a disciple of his,<br />
					without a thought<br />
					that this means he will be cut off and perish utterly<br />
					and be ended for ever;<br />
					so he does not grieve and mourn and lament,<br />
					he does not beat his breast<br />
					nor is he distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how there is an absence of worry<br />
					over the internally non-existent.</p>

					<p class="f4">You would like to possess<br />
					something that was eternal and permanent,<br />
					everlasting and unchangeable,<br />
					standing fast like heaven and earth; -<br />
					but, can you see any such possession?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen; -<br />
					nor do I.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> You would like to have a grip on personal immortality<br />
					such that thereby you would escape all grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					woe<br />
					and tribulation; -<br />
					but, can you see any such grip?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen; -<br />
					nor do I.</p>

					<p class="f4">You would like a foundation<br />
					for speculative beliefs<br />
					so sure that thereby you would escape all grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					woe,<br />
					and tribulation; -<br />
					but, can you see any such foundation?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen; -<br />
					nor do I.</p>

					<p class="f4">If there were a Self,<br />
					would there be something of the nature of a<br />
					'Self of mine'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if there were something of the nature of a Self of mine,<br />
					would there be a 'my-self'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, if really and truly<br />
					there is to be found neither Self<br />
					nor anything of the nature of Self,<br />
					is it not mere absolute folly<br />
					to hold the speculative view<br />
					that the world around me is 'the Self',<br />
					into which I shall pass hereafter, -<br />
					eternal and permanent,<br />
					everlasting and unchangeable,<br />
					standing fast like heaven and earth?</p>

					<p class="f4">How, sir, could it not be mere absolute folly?</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Almsmen?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is visible form permanent or impermanent?</p>

					<p class="f4">Impermanent, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And is the impermanent a weal or a woe?</p>

					<p class="f4">A woe, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">But can a woe<br />
					that is impermanent and changeable<br />
					properly be regarded as mine,<br />
					or as I am this,<br />
					or as this is my Self?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">[And the same argument applies also to<br />
					feelings,<br />
					perception,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness.]</p>

					<p class="f4">From which it results, Almsmen,<br />
					that all visible forms -<br />
					or feelings -<br />
					or perceptions -<br />
					or plastic forces -<br />
					or consciousness -<br />
					all this,<br />
					whether past,<br />
					present,<br />
					or future,<br />
					whether internal or external,<br />
					whether <a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> gross or subtle,<br />
					high or low,<br />
					far or near,<br />
					have all to be viewed -<br />
					if their real nature is comprehended aright -<br />
					as 'not mine',<br />
					as 'I am not this',<br />
					and as 'this is no Self of mine'.</p>

					<p class="f4">So viewing all these things,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the Noble<br />
					grows aweary of visible forms<br />
					and the rest of them;<br />
					weariness leads him to passionlessness,<br />
					and passionlessness to Deliverance,<br />
					wherein he comes to know his Deliverance<br />
					in the sure conviction:</p>

					<p class="f4">Rebirth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now there is no more of what I have been.</p>

					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he fill in his moat?</p>

					<p class="f4">When the round of birth and rebirth has passed away ... no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he get rid of the itch of wanting?</p>

					<p class="f4">When craving has passed away ... no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he cribbed and cabined no more?</p>

					<p class="f4">When the five worldly bonds have passed away ... no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is he the Noble<br />
					who has flung away pride's banner,<br />
					has cast off his burthen,<br />
					and is emancipate?</p>

					<p class="f4">When the pride in an Ego<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					has passed away ... no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">When his heart is thus Delivered,<br />
					not Indra or Brahmā or Pajāpatī,<br />
					with all their trains of gods,<br />
					can succeed in tracking down<br />
					aught on which depends a truth-finders consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because, say I,<br />
					already,<br />
					here and now,<br />
					the truth-finder<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> is untrace- <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> able.</p>

					<p class="f4">Though this is what I affirm<br />
					and what I preach,<br />
					yet some recluses and brahmins -<br />
					wrongly, erroneously, and falsely -<br />
					charge me,<br />
					in defiance of facts,<br />
					with being an annihilationist<br />
					and with preaching the disintegration,<br />
					destruction<br />
					and extirpation of existing creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just what I am not,<br />
					and what I do not affirm,<br />
					that is wrongly, erroneously, and falsely charged against me<br />
					by these good people<br />
					who would make me out to be an annihilationist.</p>

					<p class="f4">Both in the past and to-day,<br />
					I have consistently preached Ill<br />
					and the ending of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">If therein people denounce<br />
					and abuse<br />
					and revile<br />
					the truth-finder, -<br />
					this begets in him<br />
					no resentment<br />
					or annoyance<br />
					or dissatisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor, again, if people shew the truth-finder honour<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship, -<br />
					does that bring him pleasure,<br />
					satisfaction<br />
					or elation;<br />
					he only thinks that such homage<br />
					is consequent on the truth he mastered long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, if people denounce<br />
					and abuse<br />
					and revile you too,<br />
					let this breed in you<br />
					no resentment<br />
					or annoyance<br />
					or dissatisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor, if people shew you too<br />
					honour<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					or worship,<br />
					let that not bring you pleasure,<br />
					satisfaction,<br />
					or elation;<br />
					let your sole thought be<br />
					that such homage is consequent<br />
					on the truth you mastered long ago.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put from you then<br />
					what is not yours;<br />
					and thereby you will come to lasting weal and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what, Almsmen,<br />
					is that which is not yours?</p>

					<p class="f4">Visible forms are not yours;<br />
					and so put them from you<br />
					and ensure thereby<br />
					your lasting weal and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, put from you feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					the plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness;<br />
					and ensure thereby<br />
					your lasting weal and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man were to collect<br />
					or burn<br />
					or otherwise do what he liked<br />
					with the grass,<br />
					sticks,<br />
					branches<br />
					and foliage<br />
					in this grove of Jeta's, -<br />
					would it occur to you<br />
					that it was you whom he was collecting<br />
					or burning<br />
					or otherwise doing what he liked with?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir;<br />
					and why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because nothing of all this<br />
					is either our Self<br />
					or anything of the nature of a Self of ours.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></a> Just in the same way<br />
					put from you what is not yours, -<br />
					visible forms,<br />
					feelings,<br />
					and the rest;<br />
					and ensure thereby<br />
					your lasting weal and well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this wise has the Doctrine<br />
					been by me set forth aright,<br />
					the Doctrine which is clear,<br />
					open,<br />
					luminous,<br />
					and flawless,<br />
					wherein and whereby -<br />
					there is no tracing<br />
					of the course of those Almsmen who are Arahats,<br />
					in whom the Cankers are no more,<br />
					who have greatly lived,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have cast off their burthens,<br />
					who have won their weal,<br />
					and who by utter knowledge<br />
					have won deliverance;</p>

					<p class="f4">all those who have thrown off<br />
					the five fetters of this world,<br />
					 will all be translated to realms above,<br />
					from which they will never return to earth;</p>

					<p class="f4">all those who have thrown off<br />
					the three fetters<br />
					and have also reduced passion, hate and folly to a minimum<br />
					will return only once more to this world<br />
					and will then make an end of Ill;</p>

					<p class="f4">all those who have simply thrown off<br />
					three fetters,<br />
					have entered the stream of sanctification,<br />
					will escape all future states of misery,<br />
					have their future assured,<br />
					and are destined to win the fullest enlightenment;</p>

					<p class="f4">all those whose life accords<br />
					with the Doctrine<br />
					and with faith,<br />
					are all destined to win the fullest enlightenment; and</p>

					<p class="f4">all who have but faith in me<br />
					and love for me,<br />
					have heaven as their destiny.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

							<p>What Chalmers here is saying is that Ariṭṭha is maintaining that an Arahant can purposefully, actively, intentionally, with grasping, indulge (meaning not simply to passively experience the pleasure accompanying such, but to seek out experience of) in pleasures of the senses without losing his Arahantship. So <i>Chalmers</i> position is that 1. an Arahant could so indulge, and 2. that so doing he would lose his Arahantship. This is a distortion of the situation. It is <i>not possible</i> for the Arahant to purposefully seek out, intentionally pursue indulgence in sense pleasures. (By 'not possible' what is meant is something like the 'inability' of one with sense to intentionally put his hand into a fire.) But Ariṭṭha is maintaining that one can <i>become</i> an Arahant while still so intentionally endulging, so he is not precisely maintaining the idea that an Arahant can 'fall back'. The <i>Vinaya Texts,</i> cited supports this understanding (that is that A. is not speaking of the falling back of the Arahant, but that such indulgence is no barrier to the attaining of Arahantship. His view would be saying that the Arahant's engaging in such indulgence <i>would not even be called</i> falling back.</p>
							<p><i>Vinaya Texts,</i> I, 47: "If a Sāmaṇera even should say thus: 'In this wise do I understand that the Dhamma has been proclaimed by the Blessed One; that to him who cultivates those Qualities which have been called "dangerous" by the Blessed One there is not sufficient danger (to prevent his attaining to spiritual gifts);'... And if that Sāmaṇera.. shall persist ... [he] should be addressed [thus]: "From this day forth, good Sāmaṇera, neither can that Blessed One be referred to by you as your Teacher, nor can the privilege, which the other Sāmaṇeras enjoy, of sleeping in the same place with the Bhikkhus for two or three nights, any longer be yours! Depart! away with you!" </p>

							<p>This is temporary exclusion not the permanent exclusion of 'defeat'. Rehabilitation would come with a declaration of error.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> In this stock passage-here naively put into the mouth of the still living and preaching Buddha by later recensionists - <i>Bu.</i>  interprets Sutta as including the Vinaya and Abhidhamma, and therefore as signifying the Pitakas at large, - not being either exclusively in verse (like the Dhammapada and the Thera- and Therī-gāthās) or purely expository (like <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p9">Sutta No. 9</a> above or the Vedalla Suttas <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p43">Nos. 43</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">44</a> infra) or florilegia (like the <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm"><i>Udāna</i></a>).</p>
