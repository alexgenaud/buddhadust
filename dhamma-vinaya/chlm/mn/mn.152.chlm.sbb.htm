The Buddha instructs Ānanda on the attitude which should be developed with regard to the sense organs, their objects, and the sensations and emotions arising from sense experience. He then describes it as a power of one who has so developed his sense faculties that he can, at will live with whatever attitude and perceptions he may wish among both the ugly and the beautiful." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Kajangalā<br />
					in the Mukhelu grove,<br />
					the young brahmin Uttara,<br />
					a pupil of the brahmin Pārāsariya,<br />
					came to the Lord<br />
					and after exchange of civil greetings<br />
					took his seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there,<br />
					the Lord asked whether the brahmin Pārāsariya, taught his disciples the development of faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg325"><span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span></a> Yes, he does, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is his teaching on this matter?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is when the man neither sees forms with his eyes<br />
					nor hears sounds with his ear.</p>

					<p class="f4">On that showing, Uttara,<br />
					the blind and the deaf have developed their faculties, -<br />
					according to the brahmin Pārāsariya,.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a blind man can see no forms<br />
					nor can a deaf man hear sounds.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Uttara sat silent and upset,<br />
					with his shoulders hunched up<br />
					and his eyes downcast,<br />
					much exercised in mind<br />
					but finding no words to utter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the state the young brahmin was in,<br />
					the Lord observed to Ānanda<br />
					that there was a difference between the development of the faculties as taught by the brahmin Pārāsariya,<br />
					and the consummate development of the Rule of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Lord, is the time;<br />
					now, Blessed One, is the time for the Lord<br />
					to teach <a id="pt299" href="../../pali/mn/mn.152.pali.bd.htm#pg299"><span class="f2">[299]</span></a> the consummate development of the faculties<br />
					according to the Rule of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well then, Ānanda,<br />
					listen<br />
					and pay attention;<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said Ānanda in assent;<br />
					and the Lord began: -</p>

					<p class="f4">How does the consummate development of the faculties<br />
					come about in the rule of the Noble? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman in whom,<br />
					as he sees a given form,<br />
					there arises a something agreeable<br />
					or disagreeable<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">Recognizing the fact,<br />
					he bethinks him that this something which arose in him<br />
					arose because of something compounded and material,<br />
					but that the good and excellent thing<br />
					is poised indifference.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the something agreeable,<br />
					or disagreeable,<br />
					or neutral<br />
					is stilled,<br />
					and poised indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a man with eyes to see who,<br />
					having opened his eyes,<br />
					then closes them,<br />
					or who,<br />
					having closed his eyes,<br />
					then opens them again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just with the same speed<br />
					and swiftness<br />
					and ease,<br />
					indifference is established,<br />
					and the something agreeable -<br />
					or disagreeable -<br />
					or neutral -<br />
					is laid to rest.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called<br />
					the consummate development of the faculties<br />
					in the Rule of <a id="pg326"><span class="f2 g"><b>[326]</b></span></a> the Noble,<br />
					with reference to the forms which the eye sees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, as the Almsman hears a sound,<br />
					there arises in him a something agreeable<br />
					or ... indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man<br />
					can snap his fingers with ease,<br />
					so, with the same speed ...<br />
					the Rule of the Noble,<br />
					with reference to the sounds the ear hears.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, as the Almsman smells an odour,<br />
					there arises in him a something-agreeable ...<br />
					indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as <a id="pt300" href="../../pali/mn/mn.152.pali.bd.htm#pg300"><span class="f2">[300]</span></a> on an upstanding lotus-leaf,<br />
					as yet unfurled,<br />
					drops of water come about it<br />
					but, finding no resting-place,<br />
					glide off,<br />
					so, with the same speed ...<br />
					the Rule of tne Noble,<br />
					with reference to the odours the nose smells.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, as the Almsman with his tongue<br />
					tastes a savour,<br />
					there arises in him ...<br />
					indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man,<br />
					with a fleck of mucus collected on his tongue-tip,<br />
					can with ease spit it out,<br />
					so with the same speed ... Noble,<br />
					with reference to the savours the tongue tastes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, as the Almsman with his body<br />
					touches a tangible thing,<br />
					there arises in him ...<br />
					indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man can stretch out his retracted arm<br />
					or retract his outstretched arm,<br />
					so with the same speed ... Noble,<br />
					with reference to tangible things which the body touches.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, as the Almsman with his mind<br />
					cognizes a mental object,<br />
					there arises in him ... indifference is established.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man might let two or three drops of water<br />
					fall on a red-hot sheet of iron,<br />
					and then, slow though the fall of those water-drops,<br />
					they speedily shrivel up and disappear, -<br />
					so with the same speed . .. Noble,<br />
					with reference to mental objects which the mind cognizes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda,<br />
					does the consummate development of the faculties come about<br />
					in the Rule of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">How now does the Almsman<br />
					who is still under training<br />
					come to enter the true path? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					in whom, as he sees a given form -<br />
					or hears a sound etc. -,<br />
					there arises a something-agree- <a id="pg327"><span class="f2 g"><b>[327]</b></span></a> able,<br />
					or disagreeable,<br />
					or neither -<br />
					and on its arising<br />
					he is filled with loathing<br />
					and abhorrence<br />
					and disgust. -</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt301" href="../../pali/mn/mn.152.pali.bd.htm#pg301"><span class="f2">[301]</span></a> This is how he comes to enter the true path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, how comes about the Noble development of faculties? -</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					in whom, as he sees a given form -<br />
					or hears a sound etc. -,<br />
					there arises a something-agreeable,<br />
					or disagreeable,<br />
					or neither.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should his desire be to live<br />
					without consciousness of the loathsomeness<br />
					of the loathsome,<br />
					without that consciousness he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should his desire be to live<br />
					with consciousness of the loathsomeness<br />
					of the loathsome,<br />
					with that consciousness he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should his desire be to live<br />
					without consciousness of the loathsomeness<br />
					alike of the loathsome and the unloathsome,<br />
					without that consciousness he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should his desire be to live<br />
					with consciousness of the loathsomeness<br />
					alike of the unloathsome and the loathsome,<br />
					with that consciousness he lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should his desire be<br />
					to be quit and rid of<br />
					both the loathsome and the unloathsome<br />
					<a id="pt302" href="../../pali/mn/mn.152.pali.bd.htm#pg302"><span class="f2">[302]</span></a> and to live in poised indifference,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything, -<br />
					then in poised indifference he lives,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything. -</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the Noble come to developed faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, Ānanda, I have taught<br />
					the consummate development of the faculties<br />
					in the Rule of the Noble;<br />
					I have taught<br />
					how the Almsman under training<br />
					comes to enter the true path;<br />
					I have taught<br />
					how there comes the Noble development of faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">All that a fond and compassionate teacher can do for his disciples<br />
					out of his compassion for them, -<br />
					all that have I done for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, Ānanda,<br />
					are trees to sit under;<br />
					here are the abodes of solitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ponder deeply<br />
					and never flag;<br />
					lay not up remorse for yourselves hereafter; -<br />
					this is my exhortation to you.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
