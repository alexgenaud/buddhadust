A famous sutta dealing with the idea that the student of this system should not concern himself with worldly matters, even those so close to home as the abuse of nuns; also dealing with the need for patience and endurance when faced with abusive speech ... to be counteracted by training in a heart of friendliness towards one and all." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the reverend Moliya-Phagguna was always in the society of the Almswomen,<br />
					so much so indeed that, if in his presence<br />
					any Almsmen ever said a word against those Almswomen,<br />
					he was annoyed and displeased<br />
					and made a fuss about it.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Almswomen it was just the same; -<br />
					they were annoyed and displeased and made a fuss,<br />
					if in their presence<br />
					any Almsman ever said a word against him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such were the terms he was on with the Almswomen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, a certain Almsman reported all this to the Lord,<br />
					who bade an Almsman summon Moliya-Phagguna to his presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">In obedience to the summons,<br />
					the Elder came,<br />
					with due obeisance took his seat to one side,<br />
					and, being questioned about the report<br />
					concerning him and the Almswomen, admitted its truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Was it not for faith's sake, Phagguna,<br />
					that you went forth<br />
					from a comfortable home to homelessness<br />
					as a Pilgrim?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then it becomes you not,<br />
					having so gone forth on Pilgrimage,<br />
					to associate so much with Almswomen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if you hear things said in your presence against them,<br />
					you should put from you<br />
					every mundane impulse and thought,<br />
					schooling yourself never to let your heart be led away,<br />
					never to let wicked words pass your lips,<br />
					but always to be kindly and compassionate,<br />
					with your heart full of love<br />
					and void of enmity.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should be the same,<br />
					if in your presence<br />
					anyone were <a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> to strike those Almswomen with fist,<br />
					clod,<br />
					cudgel<br />
					or knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should school yourself to be the same, too,<br />
					if you yourself were reviled or struck.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning to the Almsmen, the Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">I was much pleased with the Almsmen once,<br />
					when I told them how, personally,<br />
					I only sat down to food once a day<br />
					and found that on this regimen<br />
					I was healthful and well,<br />
					buoyant,<br />
					hale,<br />
					and hearty.</p>

					<p class="f4">I urged them to do likewise<br />
					and they would benefit therefrom as I had.</p>

					<p class="f4">I had no need to instruct them in this;<br />
					all I had to do was to draw their attention to it.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">It was just like a carriage -<br />
					with thoroughbreds harnessed to it<br />
					and with the goad lying ready to hand,<br />
					on level ground<br />
					at the crossroads, -<br />
					into which there mounts a skilled driver<br />
					who knows how to manage horses;<br />
					he takes the reins in his left hand<br />
					and the goad in his right,<br />
					and away he drives,<br />
					up and down,<br />
					where he likes<br />
					and as he likes; -<br />
					even so, I had no need to instruct those Almsmen in this;<br />
					all I had to do was to draw their attention to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">So put from you<br />
					what is wrong<br />
					and yoke yourselves to right states of mind,<br />
					because thereby you will develop<br />
					and grow<br />
					and increase<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a great grove of Sal-trees<br />
					near a village or township,<br />
					which is overgrown with creepers,<br />
					and to which there comes a man<br />
					who wants the grove to thrive and flourish<br />
					and has amiable and kindly feeling towards it;<br />
					he cuts out and carries off all crooked and hurtful growths<br />
					so that the grove is cleaned and clean within;<br />
					he tends with every care<br />
					whatever wood grows straight and fair,<br />
					so that later on<br />
					the grove may develop<br />
					and grow<br />
					and increase.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so should you put from you<br />
					what is wrong<br />
					and yoke yourselves to right states of mind,<br />
					because thereby you will develop<br />
					and grow<br />
					and increase<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once on a time in this same Sāvatthī<br />
					there was a lady named Videhika,<br />
					who was reputed gentle,<br />
					and <a id="pg87"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></a> meek,<br />
					and mild.</p>

					<p class="f4">She had a maid-servant named Darkie,<br />
					a bright girl,<br />
					an early riser<br />
					and a good worker.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I wonder," thought Darkie,<br />
					"whether my mistress,<br />
					who is so well spoken of,<br />
					has really got a temper of her own<br />
					which she does not show<br />
					or whether she has got no temper at all?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or do I do my work so well that,<br />
					though she has got a temper,<br />
					she does not show it?</p>

					<p class="f4">I will try her."</p>

					<p class="f4">So next morning she got up late.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Darkie! Darkie!" -<br />
					cried the mistress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, madam," answered the girl.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why did you get up so late?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh, that's nothing, madam."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nothing, indeed, the naughty girl!"<br />
					thought the mistress,<br />
					frowning with anger and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So she has got a temper,<br />
					though she does not show it,"<br />
					thought the maid;<br />
					"it is because I do my work so well<br />
					that she does not show it;<br />
					I will try her further."</p>

					<p class="f4">So she got up later next morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Darkie! Darkie!"<br />
					cried the mistress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes madam, answered the girl."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why did you get up so late?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh, that's nothing, madam."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nothing, indeed, you naughty girl!"<br />
					exclaimed the mistress,<br />
					giving vent in words<br />
					to her anger and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes," thought the maid;<br />
					"she has got a temper,<br />
					though she does not show it<br />
					because I do my work so well;<br />
					I will try her yet further."</p>

					<p class="f4">So next morning she got up later still.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Darkie! Darkie!"<br />
					cried her mistress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, madam, answered the girl."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why did you get up so late?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh, that's nothing, madam."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nothing indeed, you naughty girl,<br />
					to get up so late!"<br />
					exclaimed the mistress;<br />
					and in her anger and displeasure<br />
					she snatched up the lynch-pin<br />
					and struck the girl on the head with it,<br />
					drawing blood.</p>

					<p class="f4">With her broken head streaming with blood,<br />
					Darkie roused the neighbourhood<br />
					with shrieks of -</p>

					<p class="f4">"See, lady, what the gentle one has done!</p>

					<p class="f4">See, lady, what the meek one has done!</p>

					<p class="f4">See, lady, what the mild one has done!</p>

					<p class="f4">What for?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just because her only maid got up late,<br />
					she was so angry and displeased<br />
					that she must up with the lynch-pin<br />
					to strike her on the head and break it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> In the result<br />
					the lady Videhika got the repute<br />
					of being violent<br />
					and anything but meek and mild.</p>

					<p class="f4">In like manner an Almsman may be gentle,<br />
					and meek,<br />
					and mild enough<br />
					so long as nothing unpleasant is said against him.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is only when unpleasant things are said against him<br />
					that you can begin to dub him gentle,<br />
					and meek,<br />
					and mild.</p>

					<p class="f4">I do not call that Almsman docile<br />
					who is docile<br />
					and evinces docility<br />
					only to get clothes<br />
					and food<br />
					and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, if he fails to get these things,<br />
					he is not docile<br />
					and evinces no docility.</p>

					<p class="f4">Him only do I call docile<br />
					whose docility springs from honouring<br />
					and venerating<br />
					and revering the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be it your task, Almsmen,<br />
					to become docile<br />
					and to evince docility<br />
					by honouring<br />
					and venerating<br />
					and revering the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are five ways in which you may be addressed, -<br />
					(i.) in or out of season,<br />
					(ii.) truthfully or untruthfully,<br />
					(iii.) mildly or harshly,<br />
					(iv.) profitably or unprofitably, and<br />
					(v.) in love or in hate;<br />
					people may speak to you from time to time<br />
					in each of these ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your task should be<br />
					to preserve your hearts unmoved,<br />
					never to allow an ill word to pass your lips,<br />
					but always to abide in compassion and goodwill,<br />
					with no hate in your hearts,<br />
					enfolding in radiant thoughts of love<br />
					the person addressing you<br />
					and proceeding thence<br />
					to enfold the whole world in your radiant thoughts of love, -<br />
					thoughts like the solid earth beneath<br />
					thoughts great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who comes with basket and shovel<br />
					to do away with the solid earth!</p>

					<p class="f4">So here he digs<br />
					and there he digs;<br />
					dumps it down here<br />
					and dumps it down there;<br />
					spits here<br />
					and stales there; -<br />
					confident that the earth<br />
					is being got rid of bit by bit!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he will succeed<br />
					in doing away with the earth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir; -<br />
					because the solid earth<br />
					is so deep<br />
					and so measureless,<br />
					that it will not readily cease to exist<br />
					before the man is tired out<br />
					and worn out himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so (futile)<br />
					are the five ways in which others may address you, -<br />
					... thoughts of love, -<br />
					thoughts <a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> like the solid earth,<br />
					great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who comes with lac and colours,<br />
					yellow<br />
					or blue<br />
					or madder,<br />
					to paint pictures on the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could do so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir;<br />
					because the air is void of form<br />
					and attributes,<br />
					so that pictures will not readily be painted on it<br />
					before the man himself is tired out<br />
					and worn out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so (futile)<br />
					are the five ways in which others may address you<br />
					... thoughts of love,<br />
					thoughts like the air above,<br />
					great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a man who comes with a blazing wisp of bracken<br />
					to set the river Ganges on fire<br />
					and burn it all up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could do so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir;<br />
					because the Ganges is so deep<br />
					and so measureless<br />
					that it will not readily be fired<br />
					and burnt up<br />
					by wisps of bracken<br />
					before the man himself is tired out<br />
					and worn out."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so (futile)<br />
					are the five ways in which others may address you<br />
					... thoughts of love,<br />
					thoughts like the Ganges,<br />
					great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a wallet of cat's skin<br />
					that has been rubbed and scrubbed<br />
					until it is as supple as supple can be,<br />
					and as soft now as gossamer,<br />
					with never a purr or a hiss left in it;<br />
					and if there came along a man<br />
					with a chip of wood<br />
					or a potsherd,<br />
					professing therewith to start it purring<br />
					and hissing again; -<br />
					do you think he could succeed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir;<br />
					because that cat's skin<br />
					has been rubbed and scrubbed<br />
					till it is as supple as supple can be,<br />
					and as soft now as gossamer,<br />
					with never a purr or a hiss left in it;<br />
					so that it will not readily be started purring and hissing again,<br />
					with his chip or potsherd,<br />
					before the man himself is tired out<br />
					and worn out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so (futile)<br />
					are the five ways in which others may address you<br />
					... thoughts of love,<br />
					thoughts like that supple and tempered wallet of cat's <a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> skin,<br />
					thoughts great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If villainous bandits<br />
					were to carve you limb from limb<br />
					with a two-handled saw,<br />
					even then the man that should give way to anger<br />
					would not be obeying my teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even then be it your task<br />
					to preserve your hearts unmoved,<br />
					never to allow an ill word to pass your lips,<br />
					but always to abide in compassion and goodwill,<br />
					with no hate in your hearts,<br />
					enfolding in radiant thoughts of love<br />
					the bandit (who tortures you)<br />
					and proceeding thence<br />
					to enfold the whole world<br />
					in your radiant thoughts of love,<br />
					thoughts great,<br />
					vast<br />
					and beyond measure,<br />
					in which no hatred is<br />
					or thought of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Almsmen, you were to ponder again and again<br />
					over this parable of the saw,<br />
					do you perceive anything,<br />
					great or small,<br />
					which you could not endure to have said to you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, Almsmen, ponder again and again<br />
					on this parable of the saw;<br />
					it will make for your abiding good and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
