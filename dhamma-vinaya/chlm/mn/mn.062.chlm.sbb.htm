					<p class="f4">One morning when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he went, duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into the city for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Behind followed the reverend Rāhula, <a id="pt421" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg421"><span class="f2">[421]</span></a> duly robed and bowl in hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without looking round, the Lord addressed Rāhula as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">All matter <i>(rūpa)</i> - past present or future,<br />
					within or without,<br />
					gross or subtile,<br />
					high or low,<br />
					far or near -<br />
					should be regarded with full comprehension that<br />
					'this is not mine' -<br />
					'not I' -<br />
					'no self of mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Matter only, Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">Only matter, Blessed One?</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Note that here Chalmers has changed his translation of <i>saŋkhārā</i> from 'plastic forces' to 'constituents' which is hard to rationalize.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Not only matter, Rāhula,<br />
					but also feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					the constituents<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Who possibly, said Rāhula,<br />
					could go to the village for alms<br />
					on the day he has heard an exhortation from the Lord's own lips?</p>

					<p class="f4">And thereupon he turned back<br />
					and seated himself under a tree,<br />
					cross legged and with body erect,<br />
					alert in mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him so seated, the reverend Sāriputta addressed him, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Aim, Rāhula, at developing the mindfulness<br />
					which comes from inhaling and exhaling,<br />
					for this, if developed and fostered,<br />
					yields a rich harvest<br />
					and proves of great avail.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising up towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					Rāhula sought out the Lord<br />
					and after salutations took a seat to one side,<br />
					asking how that mindfulness which comes from inhaling and exhaling<br />
					was produced and fostered<br />
					so as to yield a rich harvest<br />
					and prove of great avail.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rāhula, everything personal and referable to an individual<br />
					which is hard or solid or derived therefrom -<br />
					such as the hair of the head or body, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, inwards, bowels, stomach, faeces,<br />
					together with everything else personal and referable to an individual<br />
					which is hard or solid or derived therefrom -<br />
					all this makes up what is called the personal <a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> earth-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external earth-element<br />
					makes up the totality of the earth-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard this as it really is<br />
					and to comprehend it aright,<br />
					is to say -<br />
					This is not mine,<br />
					This is not I,<br />
					This is no self of mine.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt422" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg422"><span class="f2">[422]</span></a> So regarding and comprehending it,<br />
					a man turns from the earth-element<br />
					in disgust and loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">What next is the water-element?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">It may be either personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal and referable to an individual,<br />
					it embraces everything which is water or watery or derived therefrom -<br />
					such as bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, serum, saliva, mucus, synovial fluid and urine,<br />
					together with everything else personal and referable to an individual,<br />
					which is water or watery or derived therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this makes up what is called the personal water-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external water-element,<br />
					makes up the totality of the water-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard this as it really is<br />
					and to comprehend it aright<br />
					is to say -<br />
					This is not mine,<br />
					This is not I,<br />
					This is no self of mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">So regarding and comprehending it,<br />
					a man turns from the water-element<br />
					in disgust and loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire-element similarly<br />
					is either personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal, it embraces everything which is fire or fiery or derived therefrom, -<br />
					such as whatever heats, consumes or burns up,<br />
					or whatever wholly transmutes food and drink in digestion,<br />
					or anything else which,<br />
					being personal and referable to an individual,<br />
					is fire or fiery or is derived therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this is called the personal fire-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external fire-element,<br />
					makes up the totality of the fire-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard ...<br />
					loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Likewise, the air-element is either personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal, it embraces everything personal and referable to an individual<br />
					which is air or airy or derived therefrom, -<br />
					such as wind discharged upwards or downwards,<br />
					wind in the abdomen or belly,<br />
					vapours that traverse the several members,<br />
					inhalings and <a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> exhalings of breath,<br />
					together with everything else which,<br />
					being personal and referable to an individual,<br />
					is air or airy or derived therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this is called the personal air-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external air-element,<br />
					makes up the totality of the air-element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard ... <a id="pt423" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg423"><span class="f2">[423]</span></a> loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, there is the space-element,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					which is also personal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">If personal, it is either space or spacious or derived therefrom, -<br />
					such as the auditory or nasal orifices,<br />
					or the portals of the mouth,<br />
					or the channels by which victuals and drink are either swallowed or repose or pass out of the body lower down,<br />
					or aught else,<br />
					that, being personal and referable to an individual,<br />
					is space or spacious or derived therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this is called the personal space-element,<br />
					and, in combination with the external space-element,<br />
					makes up the totality of the space element.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right way to regard ...<br />
					loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow like unto the earth, Rāhula;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					no sensory impressions,<br />
					agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will grip hold of your heart and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as men cast on the earth's surface<br />
					things clean and things unclean,<br />
					ordure, urine, spittle,<br />
					pus and gore,<br />
					and yet the earth is not troubled thereby<br />
					nor moved to disgust and loathing, -<br />
					even so should you grow like unto the earth;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					no sensory impressions,<br />
					agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will lay hold of your heart and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow like unto water;<br />
					for, as you do so ...<br />
					stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as men cast into water<br />
					things clean and things unclean ...<br />
					<a id="pt424" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg424"><span class="f2">[424]</span></a> and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow like unto fire;<br />
					for, as you do ...<br />
					and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow like the wind;<br />
					for, as you do,<br />
					no sensory impressions, agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will grip hold <a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> of your heart and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as the wind blows away things clean and unclean,<br />
					ordure, urine, spittle,<br />
					pus and gore,<br />
					and yet the wind is not troubled thereby<br />
					nor moved to disgust and loathing, -<br />
					even so should you grow like unto the wind;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					no sensory impressions,<br />
					agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will grip hold of your heart and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow like space;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					no sensory impressions,<br />
					agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will grip hold of your mind and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, just as space abides nowhere,<br />
					even so should you grow like space;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					no sensory impressions,<br />
					agreeable or disagreeable,<br />
					will grip hold of your mind and stick there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in loving-kindness;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					malevolence will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in compassion;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					vexation will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in gladness over others' welfare;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					aversions will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in poised equanimity;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					all repugnance will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in contemplation of the body's corruption;<br />
					for, as you do so,<br />
					passion will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in perception of the fleeting nature of things;<br />
					<a id="pt425" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg425"><span class="f2">[425]</span></a> for, as you do,<br />
					the pride of self will pass away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Grow in the mindfulness which comes from ordered breathing;<br />
					for, this, if developed and fostered,<br />
					yields a rich harvest<br />
					and proves of great avail.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman who,<br />
					betaking himself to the jungle<br />
					or the foot of a tree<br />
					or to some abode of solitude,<br />
					there sits cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					alert in mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfully he inhales,<br />
					and mindfully he exhales his breath.</p>

					<p class="f4">When exhaling a deep breath,<br />
					he knows precisely what he is doing,<br />
					as he does too when inhaling a deep breath,<br />
					or when exhaling or inhaling a shallow breath.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the process of drawing his breath either in or out,<br />
					he schools himself either to be alive<br />
					to all bodily impressions -<br />
					or to still the several factors of body -<br />
					or to take zest therein -<br />
					or to have a sense of well-being;<br />
					he schools himself either to be alive<br />
					to the <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> heart's several factors -<br />
					or to still them -<br />
					or to be alive to the heart (as a whole) -<br />
					or to still the heart -<br />
					or to give it full play -<br />
					or to calm it -<br />
					or to bring it Deliverance;<br />
					he schools himself in breathing<br />
					to dwell on the impermanence of things,<br />
					or on passionlessness,<br />
					or on elimination,<br />
					or on Renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Rāhula, is how mindfulness in ordered breathing<br />
					is fostered and developed<br />
					so as to yield a rich harvest<br />
					and to prove of great avail.</p>

					<p class="f4">With mindfulness in breathing so fostered <a id="pt426" href="../../pali/mn/mn.062.pali.bd.htm#pg426"><span class="f2">[426]</span></a> and developed,<br />
					a man breathes his last wittingly<br />
					and not unwittingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
