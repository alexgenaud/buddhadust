Keniya, a matted hair ascetic is greatly satisfied by a teaching of the Buddha and invites him and the order of bhikkhus, 1200 in number to a meal for the next day.

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage in the Anga country <a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> across the river,<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen<br />
					numbering twelve <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg102"><span class="f2 r">[103]</span></a> hundred and fifty,<br />
					he sojourned in the Anga township of Āpaṇa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It came to the ears of Keṇiya the fire-worshipper<br />
					that the recluse Gotama,<br />
					a Sakyan who had gone forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					was reported to have arrived at Āpaṇa<br />
					with this train in the course of his alms-pilgrimage.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such, according to report,<br />
					was the high repute noised abroad concerning the reverend Gotama<br />
					that he was said to be -<br />
					The Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind -,<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches a Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is good to go and visit Arahats like him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So Keṇiya came to the Lord and,<br />
					seating himself after greetings,<br />
					was by the Lord instructed,<br />
					roused,<br />
					fired<br />
					and cheered onwards<br />
					with a doctrinal discourse, -<br />
					at the close of which<br />
					he invited the Lord and his Almsmen<br />
					to take their meal with him on the morrow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg104"><span class="f2 r">[104]</span></a> no less than twelve hundred and fifty Almsmen with me;<br />
					and you are an adherent of the brahmins.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time did Keṇiya tender his invitation,<br />
					saying this made no difference;<br />
					and a second time did he receive the same answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But when the invitation was tendered for the third time,<br />
					the Lord by his silence accepted it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya got up and went off to his own hut,<br />
					where he told his friends and kinsfolk<br />
					Gotama was coming<br />
					and asked them to help.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Readily enough they set to work digging earth-ovens,<br />
					chopping wood,<br />
					scouring pans,<br />
					setting out water-jars,<br />
					and placing seats ready, -<br />
					while Keṇiya himself marked off a reserved circle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, at that time there was living at Āpaṇa<br />
					the brahmin Sela <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg105"><span class="f2 r">[105]</span></a>,<br />
					who was versed in all three Vedas,<br />
					was accomplished in ritual with the glosses thereon,<br />
					in phonology,<br />
					and in etymology,<br />
					with chronicles as a fifth branch;<br />
					he knew exegesis,<br />
					and was learned in casuistry<br />
					and in the signs that mark a Superman;<br />
					he had three hundred young brahmins<br />
					to whom he taught the runes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this time, moreover,<br />
					Keṇiya the fire-worshipper<br />
					was an adherent of this brahmin Sela.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accompanied by his three hundred pupils,<br />
					the brah- <a id="pg80"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></a> min came in the course of his walks abroad<br />
					to Keṇiya's hut<br />
					and saw all the fire-worshippers there<br />
					busy with their several tasks,<br />
					with Keṇiya himself<br />
					marking off the reserved circle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the sight, the brahmin said to Keṇiya:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is all this?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is it a wedding-feast?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or is there a great sacrifice afoot?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or have you invited to a repast to-morrow Seniya Bimbisāra, king of Magadha,<br />
					with all his host?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is no wedding-feast, Sela,<br />
					nor is the king coming with all his host.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But I have got a great sacrifice afoot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the Sakyan who has gone forth as a Pilgrim from a Sakyan home,<br />
					has arrived at Āpaṇa,<br />
					in the course of an alms-pilgrimage,<br />
					with twelve hundred and fifty Almsmen in his train.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg106"><span class="f2 r">[106]</span></a> such, according to report,<br />
					is the high repute noised abroad concerning this Gotama<br />
					that he was said to be -<br />
					The Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is he whom I have invited to to-morrow's meal here,<br />
					together with his Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Did you attribute to him Enlightenment,<br />
					Keṇiya?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I did, Sela.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Did you?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, I did.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the Brahmin to himself: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is rubbish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rarely indeed do the Enlightened<br />
					appear in the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In our runes there have been handed down<br />
					the two and thirty marks of the Superman,<br />
					for whom, if he bears these marks,<br />
					there awaits one of two careers and no third.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Should he live a home life,<br />
					he becomes Emperor over the four quarters of the earth,<br />
					righteous in himself and ruling righteously,<br />
					triumphant abroad,<br />
					enforcing law and order at home,<br />
					and possessing the Seven Jewels, -<br />
					wheel,<br />
					elephant,<br />
					charger,<br />
					gem,<br />
					queen-consort,<br />
					treasurer and counsellor.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">More than a thousand sons has he,<br />
					heroes of might,<br />
					who sweep the enemy's hosts before them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Over all the earth,<br />
					to the shores of ocean,<br />
					he extends his sway,<br />
					by sheer righteousness alone,<br />
					and not by cudgel or sword.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, instead,<br />
					he goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					he becomes the arahat all-enlightened<br />
					who lifts the veil from the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where is Gotama now staying,<br />
					this arahat all-enlightened?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In answer, Keṇiya stretched out his right arm and said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg107"><span class="f2 r">[107]</span></a> Yonder, Sela,<br />
					in that stretch of dark trees.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the brahmin Sela proceeded to the Lord,<br />
					attended by his three hundred young brahmins,<br />
					to whom he gave the following instructions: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Move forward in silence,<br />
					in one another's footsteps<br />
					noiselessly;<br />
					for, these Lords are hard of access,<br />
					like solitary lions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> And while I am conferring with the recluse Gotama,<br />
					do not interrupt<br />
					but wait till my talk with him is over.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Arrived in the Lord's presence, the brahmin,<br />
					seating himself after greetings,<br />
					scanned the Lord's body for the two and thirty marks of a Superman,<br />
					and in time observed them all save two,<br />
					namely the privities hidden in a sheath<br />
					and the big tongue, -<br />
					concerning which two<br />
					Uttara was in doubt ana perplexity,<br />
					not feeling certain or sure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Realizing exactly brahmin Sela's uncertainty of mind,<br />
					the Lord made such a manifestation of psychic power<br />
					that the brahmin Sela could see the Lord's privities within their sheath;<br />
					and then, putting forth his tongue,<br />
					he passed it up and down the orifices of both ears<br />
					and of both nostrils,<br />
					and covered with it<br />
					<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg108"><span class="f2 r">[108]</span></a> the whole expanse of his forehead.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite sure now about the presence of the two and thirty marks,<br />
					Sela still did not know whether or not he had Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But he remembered hearing from old and aged brahmins,<br />
					teachers of teachers,<br />
					that those who became arahats all-enlightened,<br />
					reveal themselves when their praises are sung,<br />
					and so he made up his mind to extol the Lord to his face<br />
					in the following lines of eulogy: -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Perfect of body, goodly, Lord, art thou.<br />
							Well-grown, well-liking, golden-hued, with teeth<br />
							which gleam with lustre; vigour fills thy frame;<br />
							thy body's full perfection manifests<br />
							each single sign that marks a Superman.<br />
							Clear-eyed and handsome, tall, upright art thou,<br />
							effulgent as a sun among thy train,<br />
							- so debonair, so golden-hued! Why waste<br />
							thy beauty's prime as homeless anchorite?<br />
							As world-wide monarch thou shouldst ride in state;<br />
							and Ind from sea to sea should own thy sway.<br />
							<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg109"><span class="f2 r">[109]</span></a> Proud princes shall thy village headmen be;<br />
							rule thou mankiiid, as sovran king of kings.</i></p>
							
					<p class="f4">The Lord made answer:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>King indeed am I,<br />
							the peerless king of utter righteousness;<br />
							in righteousness my sovran Wheel of Truth<br />
							I roll, that backwards nevermore shall go.</i></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>If All-enlighlend thou dost claim to be,<br />
							the peerless king of utter righteousness;<br />
							rolling in righteousness your sovran Wheel,<br />
							- who ranks as Captain next to yon to keep<br />
							your Wheel still rolling onward on its course?</i></p>
							
					<p class="f4">The Lord made answer:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> <i>Next to me,<br />
							to keep my sovran Wheel of Truth still rolling on,<br />
							stands Sāriputta, in my image shaped.<br />
							I know what mind should know; I am what man<br />
							should be; I'm quit of all man should renounce;<br />
							- thus, brahmin, all enlightenment is mine.<br />
							All doubts of me dispel; have faith in me;<br />
							to view the Enlightend is a boon most rare.<br />
							<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg110"><span class="f2 r">[110]</span></a> and that rare boon thou may'st behold in me<br />
							who All-Enlighten'd am, of Healers chief,<br />
							perfect and peerless, routing Māra's hosts,<br />
							o'er foes triumphant; - fear clouds not my bliss.</i></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Sirs, mark him, mark how, lion-like, he speaks,<br />
							this Seer, this Healer, this great Conqueror.<br />
							Lives there a man so low as not to trust,<br />
							at sight, fell Māra's peerless vanquisher?<br />
							Let who will follow; let the rest depart;<br />
							- be mine the Pilgrimage with Wisdonis lord!</i></p>
							
							<p class="f4"><i>If you, sir, th' All-enlighten'd take as guide,<br />
							ours loo be Pilgrimage with Wisdom's Lord!</i></p>
							
					<p class="f4">As thus his pupils spoke,<br />
					the brahmin cried: -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Three hundred brahmins, Lord, with hands outstretch'd,<br />
							here pray to lead the higher life with thee.</i></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>That higher life</i></p>
							
					<p class="f4">- the Lord made answer then -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>stands here reveal'd, with fruits ripe here and now<br />
							the earnest Pilgrim's diligence to bless.</i></p>
							
					<p class="f4">So the brahmin Sela<br />
					and all his following<br />
					were admitted to the Lord's Confraternity<br />
					and confirmed therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when night had passed,<br />
					an excellent meal was got ready by Keṇiya the fire-worshipper,<br />
					<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg111"><span class="f2 r">[111]</span></a> who sent to tell the Lord when everything was ready,<br />
					and with his own hands<br />
					served the Lord and the Almsmen without stint<br />
					till all had had their fill,<br />
					after which he seated himself on a lower seat to one side<br />
					and was thanked by the Lord in these lines</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2"><a id="pg83"><span class="f2 g"><b>[83]</b></span></a> Of fire-oblations sacrifice ranks first;<br />
							of Vedic metres Sāvitrī is first;<br />
							a king ranks first 'mong men, 'mong streams the sea;<br />
							the moon among the lamps of night ranks first;<br />
							and first of luminaries ranks the sun.<br />
							For those who Merit seek by sacrifice,<br />
							gifts to the Almsmen profit most of all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having thanked Keṇiya the fire-worshipper in these lines,<br />
					the Lord arose and departed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dwelling alone and aloof,<br />
					strenuous,<br />
					ardent and purged of self,<br />
					the reverend Sela with his following<br />
					was not long before <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#pg112"><span class="f2 r">[112]</span></a> he won the prize<br />
					in quest of which young men go forth from home to homelessness,<br />
					that prize of prizes<br />
					which crowns the highest life; -<br />
					even this did he think out for himself,<br />
					realize,<br />
					and attain,<br />
					here and now;<br />
					and to him came the conviction that -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Rebirth is no more,<br />
					I have lived the highest life,<br />
					my task is done,<br />
					and now for me there is no more<br />
					of what I have been.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And so the reverend Sela too was numbered,<br />
					with his following,<br />
					among the arahats.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To the Lord came the reverend Sela,<br />
					with his following,<br />
					and,<br />
					with right shoulder respectfully bared,<br />
					addressed the Lord in the following lines: -</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">We who a week ago found Refuge, seer,<br />
							in thee, remoulded by thy Doctrine come.<br />
							Enlighten'd Master, over Māra's host<br />
							triumphant! Thou who, wrong propensities<br />
							Excising, for thyself salvation found<br />
							and others taught to find salvation too!<br />
							Thou hast surmounted all that breeds rebirth<br />
							and extirpated Canker-growths within.<br />
							With naught to bind thee thrall to life, thou'rt free,<br />
							as forest lion, from all fear or dread.<br />
							Three hundred Almsmen, Lord, with outstretched hands,<br />
							pray thee, great Victor, one sole grace to grant,<br />
							- that they, thy saints, may bow down at thy feet!</p>
