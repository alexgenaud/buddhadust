					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#vesali">Vesālī</a><br />
					in the Gabled Hall in Great Wood,<br />
					he had dressed himself early and was minded to go,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into the city for alms,<br />
					when Saccaka, son of the Jain (woman), came,<br />
					in the course of his wanderings,<br />
					to the Gabled Hall in Great Wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen him coming some way off,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda had said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Sir, here comes Saccaka, son of the Jain (woman),<br />
					that great controversialist,<br />
					who gives himself out as learned<br />
					and is held in high popular repute;<br />
					his aim is to discredit the Buddha<br />
					and the Doctrine<br />
					and the Confraternity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, be so good as to be seated awhile.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down on the seat set for him,<br />
					and up came Saccaka,<br />
					who, after civil greetings,<br />
					took his seat to one side,<br />
					saying to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are some recluses and brahmins, Gotama,<br />
					who are always schooling their bodies,<br />
					but not their minds, -<br />
					experiencing feelings of bodily pain,<br />
					which may paralyse the legs,<br />
					or burst the heart,<br />
					or make warm blood gush from the mouth,<br />
					or render men demented and distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have the mind conforming to the body<br />
					and being dominated by the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the mind is left unschooled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or again there are some recluses and brahmins<br />
					who are always schooling their minds,<br />
					but not their bodies, -<br />
					experiencing feelings of mental pain,<br />
					which may paralyse ...<br />
					and distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here we have the body conforming to the mind<br />
					and being dominated by the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the body is left unschooled.</p>

					<p class="f4">My belief is that the reverend Gotama's disciples<br />
					are always schooling their minds,<br />
					but not their bodies.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you heard about schooling the body?</p>

					<p class="f4">For example, Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, and Makkhali Gosāla; -<br />
					all the three of them go naked,<br />
					flout life's decencies,<br />
					lick their hands after meals,<br />
					never <a id="pg171"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></a> heed when folk call to them to come or to stop,<br />
					never accept food brought to them before their rounds<br />
					or cooked expressly for them,<br />
					never accept an invitation,<br />
					never receive food direct from pot or pan<br />
					or within the threshould<br />
					or among the faggots or pestles,<br />
					never from (one only) of two people messing together,<br />
					never from a pregnant woman<br />
					or a nursing mother<br />
					or a woman <i>in coitu,</i><br />
					never from gleanings (in time of famine)<br />
					nor from where a dog is ready at hand<br />
					or where (hungry) flies congregate,<br />
					never touch flesh<br />
					or fish<br />
					or spirits<br />
					or strong drink<br />
					or brews of grain;<br />
					or they either visit only one house a day<br />
					and there take only one morsel;<br />
					or they visit but two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven houses a day,<br />
					and take at each only two<br />
					or (up to not more than) seven morsels;<br />
					or they live on a single saucer of food a day,<br />
					or on two,<br />
					or on (up to not more than) seven saucers;<br />
					or they have but one meal a day,<br />
					or one every two days,<br />
					or (so on, up to) every seven days,<br />
					or only once a fortnight, -<br />
					on a rigid scale of rationing.</p>

					<p class="f4">And do they get along on it, Aggivessana?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">At times they partake of very good food<br />
					both hard and soft,<br />
					with very good curries<br />
					and very good drinks,<br />
					which strengthen their bodies<br />
					and build them up and put fat on them.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they revert subsequently<br />
					to what they had eschewed before,<br />
					and so there is this ebb and flow in bulk.</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you heard about schooling the mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">But concerning schooling of the mind<br />
					Saccaka did not succeed in answering the Lord's question.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said the Lord to Saccaka:</p>

					<p class="f4">The schooling of the body to which you referred just now,<br />
					is no schooling of the body<br />
					according to doctrine in the Rule of the Noble.</p>

					<p class="f4">You did not understand the schooling of the body;<br />
					much less can you know the schooling of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hear now how body and mind, respectively,<br />
					either go unschooled,<br />
					or are schooled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pay attention and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then to the assenting Saccaka the Lord spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> First, as to the unschooled body and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an ordinary uninstructed man<br />
					who has a pleasant feeling,<br />
					so that he gets a passion for things pleasant<br />
					and is passionately attached to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, that pleasant feeling passes;<br />
					and with its passing<br />
					there arises an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					at the advent of which he grieves,<br />
					mourns,<br />
					laments,<br />
					beats his breast<br />
					and gets distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pleasant feeling takes possession of his mind,<br />
					because his body is not schooled;<br />
					it is because his mind is not schooled<br />
					that the unpleasant feeling<br />
					takes possession of it; -<br />
					and the man to whom both these things happen<br />
					is neither schooled in body<br />
					nor schooled in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, as to the schooled body and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take an instructed disciple of the Noble<br />
					who has a pleasant feeling<br />
					but gets therefrom no passion for things pleasant<br />
					nor is passionately attached to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, that pleasant feeling passes;<br />
					and with its passing there arises an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					but at its advent he does not grieve,<br />
					mourn,<br />
					lament,<br />
					beat his breast,<br />
					or get distraught.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because his body is schooled<br />
					that the pleasant feeling does not take possession of his mind;<br />
					it is because his mind is schooled<br />
					that the unpleasant feeling does not take possession of it; -<br />
					and the man to whom these two things happen<br />
					is both schooled in body<br />
					and schooled in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Gotama, I feel sure,<br />
					is schooled both in body and in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Offensive though your insinuation undoubtedly is, Aggivessana,<br />
					nevertheless I will give you an answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the day I cut off my hair and beard<br />
					and donned the yellow robes<br />
					to pass from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim,<br />
					it is simply not the fact<br />
					that either any pleasant or any unpleasant feeling<br />
					could take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could it perhaps be<br />
					that you have never had feelings,<br />
					either pleasant or unpleasant,<br />
					which were such as to take possession of your mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">How could there be no such feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the days before my Enlightenment,<br />
					when as yet I was but a <a id="pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> Bodhisatta<br />
					without fullest Enlightenment,<br />
					I bethought me that -<br />
					A hole-and-corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Then came a time when I -<br />
					being quite young,<br />
					with a wealth of coal-black hair<br />
					untouched by grey<br />
					and in all the beauty of my early prime -<br />
					despite the wishes of my parents,<br />
					who wept and lamented -<br />
					cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes<br />
					and went forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">A pilgrim now,<br />
					in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Āḷāra Kālāma and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					to lead the higher life in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, venerable sir,<br />
					was his answer;<br />
					my Doctrine is such<br />
					that ere long an intelligent man<br />
					can for himself discern,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the full scope of his master's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had his Doctrine by heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far as regards mere lip-recital<br />
					and oral repetition,<br />
					I could say off the (founder's) original message<br />
					and the elders' exposition of it,<br />
					and could profess,<br />
					with others,<br />
					that I knew and saw it to the full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it struck me<br />
					that it was no Doctrine merely accepted by him on trust<br />
					that Āḷāra Kālāma, preached,<br />
					but one which he professed to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after having discerned and realized it for himself;<br />
					and assuredly he had real knowledge and vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to him<br />
					and asked him<br />
					up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized the Doctrine<br />
					he had entered on<br />
					and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of Naught,<br />
					answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Āḷāra Kālāma was not alone in possessing faith,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					rapt concentration,<br />
					and intellectual insight;<br />
					for, all these were mine too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, I asked myself,<br />
					should not I strive to realize the Doctrine<br />
					which he claims to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after discerning and realizing it for himself?</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had discerned<br />
					and realized his Doctrine for myself<br />
					and had entered on it<br />
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I went to him<br />
					and asked him whether this was the point<br />
					up to which he had discerned and realized for himself<br />
					the Doctrine which he professed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said yes;<br />
					and I said that I had reached the same point for myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing, said he,<br />
					a very great thing for us,<br />
					that in you, reverend sir,<br />
					we find such a fellow in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same Doctrine which I for myself have discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have you for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and abide in;<br />
					and that same Doctrine<br />
					which you have for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have I for myself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Doctrine which I know,<br />
					you too know;<br />
					and the Doctrine which you know,<br />
					I too know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					and as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir,<br />
					let us be joint wardens of this company!</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did Āḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					being my master,<br />
					set me, his pupil,<br />
					on precisely the same footing as himself<br />
					and show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of Naught<br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it<br />
					to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend sir,<br />
					to lead the higher life<br />
					in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, ... vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta<br />
					and asked him up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized<br />
					the Doctrine he had entered on and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of neither perception nor nonperception, answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Uddaka Rāmaputta was not alone<br />
					in possessing faith ... show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came, in the course of an alms-pilgrimage through Magadha,<br />
					to the Camp township at Uruvela<br />
					and there took up my abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said I to myself on surveying the place: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly a delightful spot,<br />
					with its goodly groves<br />
					and clear flowing river<br />
					with ghats and amenities,<br />
					hard by a village for sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What more for his striving<br />
					can a young man need<br />
					whose heart is set on striving?</p>

					<p class="f4">So there I sat me down,<br />
					needing nothing further for my striving.</p>				
					
					<p class="f4">Howbeit, there flashed in on me spontaneously<br />
					three allegories,<br />
					unknown till then:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if there were a green sappy stick in the water,<br />
					and a man came along with his drill-stick,<br />
					set on lighting a fire and making a blaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could succeed<br />
					by rubbing with his drill-stick<br />
					that green sappy stick from the water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Toil and moil as he may, he couldn't; -<br />
					because the stick is green and sappy in itself,<br />
					and moreover had been in the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is not lived aloof from pleasures of sense<br />
					in the matter of their bodies,<br />
					and who have not inwardly discarded<br />
					and rightly quelled the appetite,<br />
					taste,<br />
					infatuation,<br />
					thirst,<br />
					and feverish longing for pleasures of sense; -<br />
					they are alike incapable of understanding,<br />
					vision,<br />
					and the plenitude of Enlightenment,<br />
					whether or not paroxysms of unpleasant,<br />
					acute,<br />
					and painful feelings assail them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the first allegory,<br />
					unknown till then,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second allegory<br />
					was of a green sappy stick<br />
					lying on dry land.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think the man could light his fire with that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Toil and moil as he may, he couldn't; -<br />
					because, though the stick had been thrown<br />
					not into the water but on dry land,<br />
					yet it is green and sappy in itself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same<br />
					with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is not lived aloof ...<br />
					painful feelings assail <a id="pg174"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></a> them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the second allegory,<br />
					till then unknown,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The third allegory<br />
					was of a dry stick,<br />
					with the sap out of it,<br />
					lying on dry ground,<br />
					with a man coming along with his drill-stick,<br />
					bent on lighting a fire<br />
					and making a blaze.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think he could light his fire<br />
					with that dry stick?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, he could; -<br />
					because the stick is dry and sapless in itself<br />
					and moreover had not been in the water<br />
					but was lying on dry ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same with all recluses or brahmins<br />
					whose life is lived aloof from pleasures of sense<br />
					in the matter of their bodies,<br />
					and who have inwardly discarded<br />
					and rightly quelled the appetite,<br />
					taste,<br />
					infatuation,<br />
					thirst,<br />
					and feverish longing for pleasures of sense; -<br />
					they are alike capable of understanding,<br />
					vision,<br />
					and the plenitude of Enlightenment,<br />
					whether or not paroxysms of unpleasant,<br />
					acute<br />
					and painful feelings assail them.</p>

					<p class="f4">This was the third and last of the three allegories,<br />
					till then unknown,<br />
					which flashed in on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I then to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me,<br />
					with teeth clenched<br />
					and with tongue pressed against my palate,<br />
					by sheer force of mind<br />
					restrain,<br />
					coerce,<br />
					and dominate my heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this I did,<br />
					till the sweat streamed from my armpits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong man,<br />
					taking a weaker man by the head or shoulders,<br />
					restrains and coerces and dominates him,<br />
					even so did I,<br />
					with teeth clenched<br />
					and with tongue pressed against my palate,<br />
					by sheer force of mind<br />
					restrain,<br />
					coerce,<br />
					and dominate my heart,<br />
					till the sweat streamed from my armpits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance<br />
					which never quailed;<br />
					there was established in me<br />
					a mindfulness which knew no distraction, -<br />
					though my body was sore distressed and afflicted,<br />
					because I was harassed by these struggles<br />
					as I painfully struggled on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet even such unpleasant feelings as then arose<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought 1 to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I stopped breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose;<br />
					and <a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> then great was the noise of the air<br />
					as it passed through my ear-holes,<br />
					like the blast from a smith's bellows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue further<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I stopped breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent winds wracked my head,<br />
					as though a strong man were boring into my skull with the point of a sword.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me pursue still further<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping all breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent pains attacked my head,<br />
					as though a strong man had twisted a leather thong round my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me go on pursuing the Ecstasy<br />
					that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then violent winds pierced my inwards through and through, -<br />
					as though an expert butcher<br />
					or his man<br />
					were hacking my inwards with sharp cleavers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me still go on pursuing<br />
					the Ecstasy that comes from not breathing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I kept on stopping all breathing, in or out,<br />
					through mouth and nose and ears;<br />
					and then there was a violent burning within me, -<br />
					as though two strong men,<br />
					taking a weaker man by both arms,<br />
					were to roast and burn him up in a fiery furnace.</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolute grew my perseverance ...<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight of me,<br />
					some gods said I was dead;<br />
					others said I was not dead but dying;<br />
					while others again said that I was an Arahat<br />
					and that Arahats<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> lived like that!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me proceed to cut off food altogether.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, gods came to me<br />
					begging me not so to do,<br />
					or else they would feed me through the pores<br />
					with heavenly essences<br />
					which would keep me alive.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, thought I to myself,<br />
					while I profess to be dispensing with all food whatsoever,<br />
					these gods should feed me all the time through the pores<br />
					with heavenly essences which keep me alive,<br />
					that would be imposture on my part.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I rejected their offers, peremptorily.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me restrict myself to little tiny morsels of food at a time,<br />
					namely the liquor in which beans or vetches,<br />
					peas or pulse,<br />
					have been boiled.</p>

					<p class="f4">I rationed myself accordingly,<br />
					and my body grew emaciated in the extreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">My members, great and small,<br />
					grew like the knotted joints of withered creepers;<br />
					like a buffalo's hoof<br />
					were my shrunken buttocks;<br />
					like the twists in a rope<br />
					were my spinal vertebrae;<br />
					like the crazy rafters<br />
					of a tumbledown roof,<br />
					that start askew and aslant,<br />
					were my gaunt ribs;<br />
					like the starry gleams on water<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of a well,<br />
					shone my gleaming eyes<br />
					deep down and afar<br />
					in the depths of their sockets;<br />
					and as the rind of a cut gourd<br />
					shrinks and shrivels in the heat,<br />
					so shrank and shrivelled<br />
					the scalp of my head, -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I sought to feel my belly,<br />
					it was my backbone<br />
					which I found in my grasp;<br />
					if I sought to feel my backbone,<br />
					I found myself grasping my belly,<br />
					so closely did my belly cleave to my backbone; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I wanted to retire<br />
					for the calls of nature,<br />
					down I fell on my face; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">If for ease of body<br />
					I chafed my limbs,<br />
					the hairs of my body<br />
					fell away under my hand,<br />
					rotted at their roots; -<br />
					and all because I ate so little.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the sight of me,<br />
					some men said I was black;<br />
					others said I was brown;<br />
					while others again said I was neither black nor brown,<br />
					but dusky like a fish.</p>

					<p class="f4">To such a sorry pass<br />
					had my pure clear complexion been reduced, -<br />
					all because I ate so little.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Of all the spasms of acute and severe pain<br />
					that have been undergone through the ages past -<br />
					or will be undergone through the ages to come -<br />
					or are now being undergone -<br />
					by recluses or brahmins,<br />
					mine are pre-eminent;<br />
					nor is there aught worse beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, with all these severe austerities,<br />
					I fail to transcend ordinary human limits<br />
					and to rise to the heights<br />
					of noblest understanding and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could there be another path to Enlightenment?</p>

					<p class="f4">A memory came to me<br />
					of how once,<br />
					seated in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree<br />
					on the lands of my father the Sakyan,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					<a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a><br />
					and of wrong states of mind,<br />
					entered upon,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy,<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Could this be the path to Enlightenment?</p>

					<p class="f4">In prompt response to this memory,<br />
					my consciousness told me<br />
					that here lay the true path to Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I afraid of a bliss<br />
					which eschews pleasures of sense and wrong states of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">And my heart told me I was not afraid.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought I to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is no easy matter to attain that bliss<br />
					with a body so emaciated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me take some solid food,<br />
					rice and junket;<br />
					and this I ate accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">With me at the time<br />
					there were the Five Almsmen,<br />
					looking for me to announce to them<br />
					what truth I attained;<br />
					but when I took the rice and junket,<br />
					they left me in disgust,<br />
					saying that luxuriousness had claimed me<br />
					and that, abandoning the struggle,<br />
					I had reverted to luxuriousness.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having thus eaten solid food and regained strength,<br />
					I entered on, and abode in, the First Ecstasy.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, such pleasant feelings as then arose in me<br />
					did not take possession of my mind;<br />
					nor did they<br />
					as I successively entered on,<br />
					and abode in,<br />
					the Second,<br />
					Third,<br />
					and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stedfast and immutable, -<br />
					it was thus that I applied my heart<br />
					to the knowledge which recalled my earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">I called to mind ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4</a>)<br />
					... purged of Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, such pleasant feelings as then arose within me<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					I now applied to knowledge of the passage hence<br />
					and re-appearance else- <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> where of other creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4</a>)<br />
					... purged of Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, such pleasant feelings as then arose within me<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart I next applied to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I comprehended ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4</a>)<br />
					... purged of Self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet, such pleasant feelings as then arose within me<br />
					did not take possession of my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am aware, Aggivessana, that,<br />
					when I preach the Doctrine to some hundreds of people,<br />
					each individual imagines I am preaching for his separate behoof.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that is not the way to look at it,<br />
					when the Truth-finder is preaching the Doctrine<br />
					to people for general edification.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the close of my discourse,<br />
					I still and compose my heart,<br />
					focus and concentrate it,<br />
					with all the marks<br />
					of that precedent rapture of concentration<br />
					in which I always dwell,<br />
					unceasingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">That may be believed for the recluse Gotama,<br />
					as an Arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, does he admit<br />
					that he ever sleeps in the daytime?</p>

					<p class="f4">I am aware that,<br />
					in the last month of the hot season,<br />
					before the rains set in,<br />
					when, after my meal,<br />
					I am back from my round for alms,<br />
					my robe is folded in four for me<br />
					and I, lying on my right side,<br />
					pass into slumber, -<br />
					but in full mindfulness,<br />
					and fully alive to what I am doing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what some recluses and brahmins call stupor.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far, Aggivessana,<br />
					stupor is neither present nor absent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now hear how there is,<br />
					and how there is not,<br />
					real stupor.</p>

					<p class="f4">Give me your attention and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly, said Saccaka in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord said:</p>

					<p class="f4">The man who has not put from him the Cankers -<br />
					which are of impurity,<br />
					lead to rebirth,<br />
					entail suffering,<br />
					ripen unto sorrow,<br />
					and leave a heritage of birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death, -<br />
					this is the man who is in a real stupor;<br />
					for his stupor comes from not being quit of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the man who is quit of them,<br />
					is in no stupor,<br />
					because he is beyond stupor <a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> by being quit of the Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the Truth-finder, Aggivessana,<br />
					all these Cankers have been put away,<br />
					have been grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					like a bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree grew,<br />
					things that once have been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a palm<br />
					with its head chopped off<br />
					is incapable of growing,<br />
					so in the Truth-finder<br />
					all the Cankers -<br />
					which are of impurity,<br />
					lead to re-birth,<br />
					entail suffering,<br />
					ripen unto sorrow,<br />
					and leave a heritage of birth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					and death -<br />
					have been grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					like a bare cleared site<br />
					where once a palm-tree grew,<br />
					things that once have been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">After these words, Saccaka, son of the Jain (woman),<br />
					said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is wonderful,<br />
					it is marvellous,<br />
					how, while you were being spoken to so offensively<br />
					and with such insinuations,<br />
					you have not changed colour<br />
					nor has your countenance altered; -<br />
					quite like an Arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am aware, Gotama, that I have taken in hand,<br />
					point by point,<br />
					Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhi-putta, and Nāta-putta the Jain;<br />
					and each in turn,<br />
					being taken in hand by me<br />
					point by point,<br />
					wandered off from one thing to another,<br />
					switching the discussion on to something else,<br />
					exhibiting annoyance,<br />
					bad temper,<br />
					and resentment.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the reverend Gotama,<br />
					while he was being spoken to so offensively<br />
					and with such insinuations,<br />
					never changed colour<br />
					nor did his countenance alter; -<br />
					quite like an Arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now, he added,<br />
					I ought to go;<br />
					for, I have much to do and attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">At your good pleasure, Aggivessana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having expressed his gratification and thanks<br />
					for what he had heard,<br />
					Saccaka got up and went his way.</p>
