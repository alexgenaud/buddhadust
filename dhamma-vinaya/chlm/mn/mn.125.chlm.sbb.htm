					<p class="f4">Once while the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					there was living in the Forest Hut there<br />
					the novice Aciravata, -<br />
					to whom in the course of a stroll<br />
					came Prince Jayasena.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sitting down after greetings,<br />
					the prince observed that he had heard<br />
					that, in this faith,<br />
					an Almsman whose life was strenuous ardent and purged of self<br />
					could find peace for his heart.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Quite right prince,<br />
					quite right;<br />
					that is what he does find here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would the reverend Aggivessana be so good<br />
					as to teach me the Doctrine<br />
					as he has heard it preached<br />
					and as he has learned it?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, prince, I cannot.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Were I to teach you,<br />
					you would not understand the meaning of what I said;<br />
					and that would be a trouble<br />
					and an annoyance for me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt129" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg129"><span class="f2">[129]</span></a>	I hope you will teach it me;<br />
					I may prove capable of understanding<br />
					what your reverence says.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Very good, I will teach it you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you understand it,<br />
					so well and good.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If you do not understand it,<br />
					remain as you are<br />
					and ask me no further questions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So be it then, said the prince.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg230"><span class="f2 g"><b>[230]</b></span></a> Thereupon Aciravata taught the Doctrine<br />
					as he had heard it preached<br />
					and as he had learned it; -<br />
					but at the close of his exposition<br />
					Prince Jayasena said it was impossible<br />
					and inconceivable<br />
					that an Almsman whose life was strenuous ardent and purged of self<br />
					could find peace for his heart in the faith;<br />
					and with this protestation<br />
					he rose and withdrew.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not long after the prince had gone,<br />
					Aciravata went to the Lord<br />
					to whom, after seating himself after salutations,<br />
					he related the talk he had had with Jayasena.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the Lord:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where was the good of that?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wholly impossible for Prince Jayasena -<br />
					who lives in the lap of enjoyment and pleasure,<br />
					who is devoured by thoughts of pleasure,<br />
					consumed by the fevers of pleasure<br />
					and is all eagerness <a id="pt130" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg130"><span class="f2">[130]</span></a> in pursuit of pleasure -<br />
					to know or see or realize<br />
					what is to be known by renouncing worldliness,<br />
					and what is to be seen and attained thereby.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like two young elephants or colts or steers<br />
					who have been schooled and trained,<br />
					and another pair who have not been schooled or trained.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would the pair that have been schooled and trained aright,<br />
					thereby accomplish their schooling<br />
					and thereby be trained to perfection?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And would the other untrained pair do the same?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just the same here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wholly impossible for Prince Jayasena ... and attained thereby.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is just like a great mountain<br />
					hard by a village or township<br />
					to which come two friends<br />
					hand in hand together,<br />
					of whom the first climbs to the top<br />
					while the other,<br />
					still standing at the bottom,<br />
					asks the first what he can see up there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The first says he can see from the top<br />
					delightful pleasaunces and groves,<br />
					delightful country and lakes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But his friend at the bottom<br />
					says it is impossible <a id="pt131" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg131"><span class="f2">[131]</span></a> and inconceivable he can do so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon the climber<br />
					comes down to the bottom<br />
					and, taking his friend up by the arm to the top,<br />
					first lets him recover his wind<br />
					and then asks him what he can see from the summit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The answer is that he <a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> can see delightful pleasaunces and groves,<br />
					delightful country and lakes,<br />
					and that, whereas he had begun by saying it was impossible and inconceivable,<br />
					he now knew it was all as reported, -<br />
					though the great mountain had blocked his view<br />
					of what could be seen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Aggivessana,<br />
					Prince Jayasena is blocked,<br />
					obstructed,<br />
					cribbed and cabined<br />
					by a mass of ignorance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is wholly impossible for Prince Jayasena ... and attained thereby.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, Aggivessana, these two comparisons of the prince had occurred to you,<br />
					he would have been converted straightaway<br />
					and, being converted,<br />
					would have acted accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, sir, could these two comparisons occur to me,<br />
					as they have to the Lord,<br />
					seeing that they are spontaneous<br />
					and have never before been heard by man?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt132" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg132"><span class="f2">[132]</span></a> It is just like a Noble anointed King,<br />
					who tells his elephant-catcher<br />
					to mount the royal elephant<br />
					and go into the elephant-forests<br />
					and there find a wild elephant<br />
					which he is to tie up to the neck of the royal elephant;<br />
					and the elephant-catcher does as he is ordered<br />
					and in the result<br />
					the royal elephant brings the wild one<br />
					out of the forest into the open;<br />
					into the open he has been brought thus far;<br />
					but still that wild elephant pines for one thing, -<br />
					the elephant-forest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the elephant-catcher informs the monarch<br />
					that a wild elephant has been brought in from the forest;<br />
					and now his majesty orders his elephant-trainer to tame it, -<br />
					subduing all wild ways,<br />
					all wild tendencies to bolt away,<br />
					and all wild feverishness of distress and fretfulness,<br />
					making him feel at home in the village,<br />
					and used him to human ways.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Obedient to the King's command,<br />
					the trainer proceeds so to tame that wild elephant,<br />
					first tying it fast by the neck<br />
					to a massive post planted deep in the ground,<br />
					with a view both to subduing all wild ways,<br />
					all wild tendencies to bolt away<br />
					and all wild feverishness of distress and fretfulness<br />
					and also to making the elephant<br />
					feel quite at home in the village<br />
					and used to human ways.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Towards his charge<br />
					the trainer addresses words that are without <a id="pg232"><span class="f2 g"><b>[232]</b></span></a> gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					hearty,<br />
					urbane,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all;<br />
					and the elephant,<br />
					<a id="pt133" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg133"><span class="f2">[133]</span></a> thus addressed,<br />
					hearkens and gives ear<br />
					and seeks to learn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, the trainer offers him grass fodder and water;<br />
					and, as soon as the elephant takes it,<br />
					the trainer is satisfied it will live;<br />
					and he proceeds to teach it<br />
					to take up and put down.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the elephant acts as it is told<br />
					and obeys the orders to take up and put down,<br />
					then he goes on to teach it,<br />
					at the proper word of command,<br />
					to advance or retire<br />
					and to stand up and sit down.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this has been learned,<br />
					the trainer proceeds to teach the elephant<br />
					to stand his ground,<br />
					as it is called.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On to the great beast's trunk he ties a shield;<br />
					a man with a lance in his hand is seated on its neck;<br />
					all round stand men with lances in their hands,<br />
					while the trainer stands in front<br />
					with a very long-shafted spear.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the elephant is standing his ground,<br />
					he never moves his front feet or his hind feet,<br />
					his forequarters or his hindquarters,<br />
					his head or his ears,<br />
					his tusks or his tail or his trunk.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It becomes the King's own elephant,<br />
					undismayed by stroke of javelin or sword or arrow or opposing foemen,<br />
					undismayed by sound of tom-tom or kettle-drum or conch or drum or music,<br />
					(like) gold purified and cleansed from all dross and impurity, -<br />
					an elephant for a king to ride,<br />
					a pride to his royal master,<br />
					and is styled part and parcel of the King.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt134" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg134"><span class="f2">[134]</span></a> Just in the same way, Aggivessana,<br />
					there comes into the world here a Truth-finder,<br />
					arahat allenlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This world - with its gods and Māras and Brahmās,<br />
					with its recluses and brahmins,<br />
					with its gods and men -<br />
					all this he has discerned and realised for himself<br />
					and reveals to others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He preaches the Doctrine -<br />
					that is so fair at its outset,<br />
					in the middle and in its close -<br />
					with its text and its meaning;<br />
					he announces a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by a householder<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of lowly birth,<br />
					who, hearing, believes in <a id="pg233"><span class="f2 g"><b>[233]</b></span></a> the Truth-finder,<br />
					and, believing, bethinks him that -<br />
					'A hole and corner life<br />
					is all that a home can give,<br />
					whereas the Pilgrim is free as the air of heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is hard for the home-keeping man<br />
					to follow the higher life<br />
					in all its completeness and purity and perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, let me cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereafter, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from his kith and kin,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Into the open<br />
					the disciple of the Noble One<br />
					has been brought thus far;<br />
					but still gods and men pine for one thing, -<br />
					pleasures of sense.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder proceeds with his training, saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, Almsman; let your life be virtuous<br />
					and controlled by the canon law;<br />
					let your life be curbed<br />
					by the curb of the canon law;<br />
					keep to the plane of right behaviour;<br />
					observe scrupulously the precepts of Conduct,<br />
					seeing danger in small offendings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he has accomplished this,<br />
					the Truth-finder proceeds further with his training,<br />
					bidding him guard the portals of sense<br />
					and not be carried away<br />
					when his eye sees a thing,<br />
					either by its general presentment<br />
					... (etc. as in <a href="mn.107.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 107</a>) ...<br />
					<a id="pt135" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg135"><span class="f2">[135-136]</span></a> purged his heart of all misgivings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he has put from him these five Hindrances<br />
					and has understood how the heart's shortcomings weaken it,<br />
					then he dwells ardent,<br />
					alive to everything,<br />
					mindful,<br />
					and quit of all worldly wants and discontent,<br />
					contemplating the body as an aggregation,<br />
					feelings as aggregations,<br />
					the heart as an aggregation,<br />
					and mental objects as aggregations.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as the trainer ties his elephant fast by the neck<br />
					to a massive post planted deep in the ground<br />
					with a view to subduing all its wild ways<br />
					and to making the animal feel quite at home in the village<br />
					and used to human ways, -<br />
					just in the same way<br />
					the fourfold mustering of mindfulness<br />
					serves to tie fast the heart of the disciple of the Noble One,<br />
					both for the subduing of worldly conduct,<br />
					worldly thoughts,<br />
					and worldly distress<br />
 					<a id="pg234"><span class="f2 g"><b>[234]</b></span></a> 					fevershness and fretfulness<br />
 					and also for the attainment of Knowledge<br />
 					and the realization of Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Truth-finder proceeds further with the training, saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, Almsman, contemplate the body<br />
 					but entertain no thought<br />
 					which the body accompanies;<br />
					contemplate the heart<br />
 					but entertain no thought which the heart accompanies;<br />
					contemplate mental objects<br />
 					but entertain no thought which mental objects accompany.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By laying to rest observation and reflection,<br />
					the Almsman develops,<br />
					and dwells in,<br />
					inward serenity,<br />
					in focussing of heart,<br />
					in the joy of the Second Ecstasy<br />
 					which is divorced from observation and reflection<br />
 					and is bred of concentration, -<br />
 					passing thence to the Third and Fourth Ecstasies.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
 					it is thus that he applies his heart<br />
 					to the knowledge which recalls his former existences.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, - a single birth,<br />
					then two,<br />
					and ... [so on,<br />
					to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an a:on of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an eeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an son both of its disintegration and of its redintegration. In this or that existence,<br />
					he remembers,<br />
					such and such was his name,<br />
					sept,<br />
					and caste,<br />
					the fare lived on,<br />
					the pleasure and pain he had in each,<br />
					and his term of life in each.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he passed thence,<br />
					he came to such and such a new existence,<br />
					and there such and such was his name and so forth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Passing thence, he came to life here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In such wise does he call to mind his divers existences in the past in all their details and features.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The same stedfast mind<br />
 					he now applies to the Knowledge of the passage hence<br />
 					and re-appearance elsewhere<br />
 					of other creatures.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial<br />
 					that is pure<br />
 					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees creatures in act to pass hence,<br />
					in act to re-appear elsewhere, -<br />
 					creatures either lowly or debonair,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					happy or unhappy;<br />
					and he is aware that they fare according to their past.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here are creatures given to evil<br />
 					in act word and <a id="pg235"><span class="f2 g"><b>[235]</b></span></a> thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble Ones,<br />
					held false views<br />
					and became what flows from such false views;<br />
					these at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					appear in states of suffering misery tribulation,<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Here again are creatures given to good<br />
					in act word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble Ones,<br />
					who had a right outlook<br />
					and became what flows from such a right outlook; -<br />
					these at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					appear in states of bliss in heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to the knowledge<br />
					of the eradication of the Cankers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Causally and utterly he comes to know Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill;<br />
					causally and utterly he comes to know<br />
					what the Cankers are, -<br />
					their origin,<br />
					their cessation,<br />
					and the course that leads to their cessation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this,<br />
					then his heart is delivered from the Canker of lusts,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Re-birth is no more;<br />
					I have lived the highest life;<br />
					my task is done;<br />
					and now for me there is no more of what I have been.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman endures cold and heat,<br />
					hunger and thirst,<br />
					gadflies,<br />
					mosquitoes,<br />
					scorching winds,<br />
					contact with creeping things,<br />
					abusive and hurtful language;<br />
					<a id="pt137" href="../../pali/mn/mn.125.pali.bd.htm#pg137"><span class="f2">[137]</span></a> he has grown to bear all bodily feelings that are painful,<br />
					acute,<br />
					sharp,<br />
					severe,<br />
					wretched,<br />
					miserable,<br />
					or deadly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Purged of all the dross and alloy<br />
					of passion wrath and folly,<br />
					he is worthy of oblations,<br />
					offerings,<br />
					gifts and homage,<br />
					and is the richest field<br />
					in which to sow the seed of merit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, Aggivessana,<br />
					the King's elephant dies untamed and untrained,<br />
					whether in its old-age or in middle-age or in youth,<br />
					it is said to have died untamed;<br />
					and similarly,<br />
					if the Cankers are not extinct<br />
					in an Almsman old or young,<br />
					he at death is said to have died untamed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if the King's elephant,<br />
					be it old or be it young,<br />
					dies tamed and trained,<br />
					it is said to have died tamed;<br />
					and similarly,<br />
					be he old or be he young,<br />
					the Almsman in <a id="pg236"><span class="f2 g"><b>[236]</b></span></a> whom the Cankers are extinct,<br />
					is said at death to have died tamed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the novice Aciravata rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
