Pukkusati, who was a wanderer who had become a follower of the Buddha without ever having met him, finds himself lodged in the same shed with him. The Buddha instructs him in great detail concerning the attitudes to take towards all the characteristics of existence such as to attain an unshakable calm. He requests ordination, but is not equipped with the necessary bowl and robes. Setting out to get such he is killed by a bull. The Buddha tells the other Bhikkhus he was reborn as a non-returner." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was on an alms-pilgrimage through Magadha,<br />
					he arrived at Rājagaha<br />
					and went to Bhaggava the potter,<br />
					to whom he said that,<br />
					if it was not inconvenient,<br />
					he would stay the night there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhaggava answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">Not at all inconvenient, sir;<br />
					there is a Pilgrim in residence already;<br />
					but, if he consents,<br />
					stay here as long as you like.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt238" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg238"><span class="f2">[238]</span></a> Now at that time<br />
					there was a young man named Pukkusāti<br />
					who for faith's sake<br />
					had gone forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim<br />
					to follow the Lord;<br />
					and he it was<br />
					who was already in residence in the potter's dwelling<br />
					and to whom the Lord came<br />
					to say that, if it was not inconvenient,<br />
					he would stay the night there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pukkusāti answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">The potter's dwelling is spacious;<br />
					stay as long as your reverence likes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering the house,<br />
					the Lord spread a grass-mat<br />
					and sat down on it cross-legged,<br />
					with body erect,<br />
					and with mindfulness as the objective he set before himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the great part of the night<br />
					the Lord remained thus sitting, -<br />
					as also did the reverend Pukkusāti.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wondering whether the young man was agreeable,<br />
					and <a id="pg291"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></a> deciding to question him,<br />
					the Lord asked:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whom do you follow?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who is your master?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whose Doctrine have you embraced?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is, sir, the recluse Gotama<br />
					the Sakyan who left a Sakyan family<br />
					to become a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of the Lord Gotama<br />
					is this high repute noised abroad,<br />
					that he is said to be the Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of deities and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">That Lord do I follow in my pilgrimage;<br />
					the Lord is my master;<br />
					it is that Lord's Doctrine which I have embraced.</p>

					<p class="f4">Where at the present time, Almsman,<br />
					is the Lord,<br />
					the arahat all-enlightened?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the countries to the North, sir,<br />
					there is a town named Sāvatthī,<br />
					and there at the present time dwells the Lord,<br />
					arahat all-enlightened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you ever set eyes on the Lord, Almsman?</p>

					<p class="f4">If you saw him,<br />
					would you recognize him?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt289" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg289"><span class="f2">[289]</span></a>	No, sir; I have never seen him,<br />
					nor should I recognize him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bethinking him that this young man was a Pilgrim in his own train,<br />
					and resolving to preach the Doctrine to him,<br />
					the Lord said: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I will preach the Doctrine to you, Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay attention<br />
					and I will speak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said the reverend Pukkusāti in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord: -</p>

					<p class="f4">In a man there are six Elements,<br />
					six Contacts,<br />
					eighteen mental Researches,<br />
					four Resolves,<br />
					established in which<br />
					he has no outflow of imaginings and,<br />
					having it not,<br />
					is styled the tranquil Sage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let him hold fast to understanding;<br />
					safeguard truthfulness;<br />
					foster Renunciation;<br />
					and work for naught but tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the synopsis<br />
					of the exposition of the six elements.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said a man contained six elements;<br />
					and these are -<br />
					earth,<br />
					water,<br />
					fire,<br />
					air,<br />
					space<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said a man had six spheres of contact;<br />
					and these are -<br />
					sight,<br />
					sound,<br />
					smell,<br />
					taste,<br />
					touch<br />
					and mental objects.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said there were mental researches;<br />
					and these <a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> relate to 'agreeable,<br />
					to disagreeable<br />
					and to neutral research<br />
					into the objects of the six several senses.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt240" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg240"><span class="f2">[240]</span></a> I said a man had four resolves;<br />
					and these are the resolves to understand,<br />
					to be truthful,<br />
					to renounce,<br />
					and to win tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said further that a man should<br />
					hold fast to understanding,<br />
					safeguard truthfulness,<br />
					foster Renunciation,<br />
					and work for naught but tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, how does he hold fast to understanding? -</p>

					<p class="f4">(To begin with,) there are the aforesaid six elements,<br />
					the nature of which is as follows: -</p>

					<p class="f4">The earth-element may be internal or external.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatsoever, being internal and personal,<br />
					is solid and hard or derivative therefrom ...<br />
					<i>(etc. as in <a href="mn.062.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta No. 62</a>)</i> ...<br />
					<a id="pt241" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg241"><span class="f2">[241-242]</span></a> turns from the space-element in disgust<br />
					and with loathing of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Over and above these five elements),<br />
					consciousness will still remain,<br />
					purified and cleansed,<br />
					whereby a man knows anything<br />
					and can distinguish the pleasant and the unpleasant<br />
					both from one another<br />
					and from what is neither one nor the other.</p>

					<p class="f4">By pleasurable coutact<br />
					arises a pleasant feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">While experiencing that pleasant feeling,<br />
					the man knows precisely that he is experiencing it,<br />
					as he knows also -<br />
					when the pleasurable contact passes away -<br />
					that the pleasant feeling<br />
					which arose from the particular pleasurable contact<br />
					is passing away and disappearing.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too with what is unpleasant<br />
					and with what is neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, Almsman, as, when two sticks are brought in contact and rubbed together,<br />
					heat and sparks arise,<br />
					but, when they are separated and parted,<br />
					the heat passes away and disappears, -<br />
					just in the same way <a id="pt248" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg248"><span class="f2">[248]</span></a> by pleasurable contact a pleasant feeling arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">While experiencing that ... nor unpleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Poised indifference will still remain,<br />
					which is purified and cleansed,<br />
					soft, workable and resplendent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like a skilled goldsmith<br />
					or his apprentice<br />
					who sets up his charcoal fire,<br />
					on which he heats his crucible,<br />
					placing therein with his tongs<br />
					a piece of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">Occasionally he uses his blowpipe,<br />
					occasionally he sprinkles <a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> water on it,<br />
					and occasionally he looks to see how it is going on,<br />
					until at the last the gold melts<br />
					and is thoroughly melted and molten,<br />
					refined and pure of all dross,<br />
					so that it is soft,<br />
					workable and resplendent,<br />
					fit for any jewellery he wants -<br />
					be it a trinket<br />
					or earrings<br />
					or necklet<br />
					or wreath of gold -;<br />
					and the result is good. -</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way<br />
					poised indifference will remain,<br />
					purified and cleansed,<br />
					soft,<br />
					workable<br />
					and resplendent.</p>

					<p class="f4">His is the clear knowledge that; -</p>

					<p class="f4">If I focus this purified and cleansed indifference<br />
					on the sphere of Infinite Space -<br />
					or Mind -<br />
					or Neither-perception-nor-Non-perception -<br />
					and develop my heart in its analogues,<br />
					in that way this indifference of mine,<br />
					so resting and so supported,<br />
					will persist for a very long time indeed; -<br />
					<a id="pt244" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg244"><span class="f2">[244]</span></a> but still it is only a product<br />
					and a passing effect.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Inly. Inward, interior, internal, inwardly felt, heart-felt; within, in the heart, spirit, or inner nature; in a way that goes to the heart or inmost part; heartily, intemately, closely, fully, thoroughly, extremely. O.E.D.</p>
							<p><img src="../../../resources/images/king_of_ny_vrysm.gif" width="38" height="32" alt="p.p. explains it all" /> <span class="f2">— p.p.</span></p>
						</div>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, he neither toils at,<br />
					nor ponders on,<br />
					rises and falls of things;<br />
					and consequently he is dependent<br />
					on nothing whatever in the world<br />
					and, being independent,<br />
					is harried by no fears,<br />
					and, being not harried,<br />
					inly passes away,<br />
					sure that for him rebirth is no more,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life<br />
					and accomplished his task,<br />
					with no more now of what he has been!</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels a pleasant feeling -<br />
					or an unpleasant feeling -<br />
					or a feeling that is neither pleasant nor unpleasant -,<br />
					he knows well that such feelings are transitory,<br />
					are not to be swallowed whole,<br />
					and are not to be made into a joy;<br />
					he always maintains detachment<br />
					from any such feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has a feeling of his bodily end,<br />
					he knows it as such;<br />
					he knows - as such - a feeling <a id="pt245" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg245"><span class="f2">[245]</span></a> of his life's ending;<br />
					he knows that,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after life's close,<br />
					all feelings and joys will there and then merge in calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like an oil-lamp<br />
					which draws its light from oil and wick,<br />
					but, when oil and wick give out,<br />
					if it be not fed afresh<br />
					but goes unfed,<br />
					then it goes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it<br />
					with him who has this understanding<br />
					of feelings of his bodily end<br />
					and of his life's end<br />
					and of the merging in calm thereafter<br />
					of all feelings and joys.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it is that an Almsman so endowed<br />
					is <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> endowed with the highest resolve to understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the highest noble understanding<br />
					is to know the ending of all Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Assured is the Deliverance<br />
					which rests on Truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, falsehood is what is false in itself;<br />
					Truth is Nirvana where no falsehood dwells.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it is that an Almsman so endowed<br />
					is endowed with the highest Resolve for truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, the highest noble truth is Nirvana<br />
					where no falsehood dwells.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the days before his eyes were opened,<br />
					his ties to existence were strong and cherished;<br />
					now they are gone, -<br />
					grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					leaving only a bare cleared site,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more;<br />
					and therefore it is that an Almsman so endowed<br />
					is endowed with the highest Resolve for renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, the highest noble renunciation<br />
					is to be quit of all ties to existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the days before his eyes were opened,<br />
					he was a prey to covetise lusts and passion;<br />
					now these are all gone, -<br />
					grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					leaving only a bare cleared site,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more;<br />
					gone too for ever are spite,<br />
					hatred,<br />
					and malice,<br />
					with ignorance and error, -<br />
					<a id="pt246" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg246"><span class="f2">[246]</span></a> grubbed up by the roots,<br />
					leaving only a bare cleared site,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore it is that an Almsman so endowed<br />
					is endowed with the highest Resolve for tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the highest noble tranquillity<br />
					is to tranquillize lust hate and folly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I said further that,<br />
					so established,<br />
					a man has no outflow of imaginings<br />
					and, having it not,<br />
					is styled the tranquil Sage.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what that means: -</p>

					<p class="f4">There are the imaginings<br />
					that I am,<br />
					that I am this person,<br />
					May I be reborn,<br />
					May I not be reborn,<br />
					May I be reborn with form -<br />
					without form -<br />
					with perception -<br />
					without perception -<br />
					neither with nor without perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the imaginings of disease, -<br />
					abscesses<br />
					and pangs.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is by passing beyond all imaginings<br />
					that a man is called the tranquil Sage.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tranquil Sage<br />
					knows neither rebirth nor decay,<br />
					neither hopes nor fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing to entail his rebirth<br />
					and so how should he decay?<br />
					or die?<br />
					or fear?<br />
					or hope?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> This synopsis<br />
					of the exposition<br />
					of the six elements, Almsman,<br />
					you should treasure up in your memory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Realizing that the Master himself was there,<br />
					the Blessed One,<br />
					the All-enlightened,<br />
					the reverend Pukkusāti rose from his seat,<br />
					bared one shoulder respectfully,<br />
					bowed down his head at the Lord's feet,<br />
					saying: -</p>

					<p class="f4">I have transgressed<br />
					in my folly and error and wrongfulness,<br />
					in that I presumed to address the Lord as 'your reverence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask the Lord to accept my confession,<br />
					for my avoidance of transgression in future.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt247" href="../../pali/mn/mn.140.pali.bd.htm#pg247"><span class="f2">[247]</span></a>	The Lord duly accepted the confession tendered,<br />
					concluding with the words:</p>

					<p class="f4">It marks growth in the Rule of the Noble<br />
					when, recognizing his transgression as such,<br />
					a man makes amends<br />
					and keeps watch and ward against future lapses.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask to receive Confirmation at the Lord's hands.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you equipped, Almsman,<br />
					with bowl and robes?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Truth-finders, Almsman,<br />
					do not confirm one<br />
					who is unequipped with bowl and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rejoicing in what the Lord had said,<br />
					the reverend Pukkusāti expressed his gratitude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, rising up,<br />
					with deep reverence<br />
					he departed to get bowl and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">But on his way a mad cow took his life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereon, a number of Almsmen came to the Lord<br />
					with the news that the young man Pukkusāti<br />
					to whom he had given that concise instruction<br />
					was dead.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, they asked, is he re-born to,<br />
					and what is his destiny?</p>

					<p class="f4">Instructed was the young man Pukkusāti;<br />
					he embraced the Doctrine and its corollaries;<br />
					he gave me no trouble doctrinally.</p>

					<p class="f4">By destroying the five Bonds of this lower sphere,<br />
					the young man Pukkusāti has been translated hence<br />
					to realms above,<br />
					never to return thence to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
