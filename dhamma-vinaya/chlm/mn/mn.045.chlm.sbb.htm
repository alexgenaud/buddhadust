					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Almsmen!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, said they in answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord spoke these words:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are four ways to profess a Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first is pleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to pain thereafter;<br />
					the second is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripens to pain thereafter;<br />
					the third is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter;<br />
					and the fourth is not only pleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching the first of the four,<br />
					there are some recluses and brahmins<br />
					who maintain and hold that -</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing wrong in pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they give way to indulgence in pleasures of sense;<br />
					they disport themselves with top-knotted girl-Wanderers;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and they say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is it that recluses and brahmins,<br />
					detecting future peril from pleasures of sense,<br />
					call on people to eschew them,<br />
					and insist on their real nature?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant are the tender,<br />
					young,<br />
					downy arms of my girl-Wanderer!</p>

					<p class="f4">So they give way to indulgence in pleasures of sense,<br />
					with the result that,<br />
					after death at the body's dissolution,<br />
					they pass to states of woe and suffering<br />
					or to purgatory,<br />
					where they experience anguish and torment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here they realize why recluses and brahmins,<br />
					detecting future peril from pleasures of sense,<br />
					called on people to eschew them,<br />
					and insisted on their real nature!</p>

					<p class="f4">For, here they find themselves<br />
					experiencing feelings of anguish and torment, -<br />
					solely because, and by reason, of these pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if,<br />
					in the last month of the hot season of <a id="pg220"><span class="f2 g"><b>[220]</b></span></a> the year,<br />
					a creeper's seed-pod should burst open<br />
					and one of the seeds should fall<br />
					at the foot of a sāl-tree, -<br />
					to the great alarm and consternation<br />
					of the deity residing in the tree;<br />
					and just as if that deity's friends and kinsfolk -<br />
					deities resident in pleasaunce and grove,<br />
					in trees and medicinal herbs<br />
					and woodlands -<br />
					should gather together and assemble<br />
					to allay that deity's alarm<br />
					with cheerful hopes<br />
					that no doubt the creeper's seed<br />
					would be pecked up by a peacock,<br />
					or munched by a deer,<br />
					or consumed by a forest fire,<br />
					or be taken away by woodmen,<br />
					or eaten by white ants, -<br />
					or perhaps might never germinate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that none of these things happened to that seed,<br />
					and suppose that it did germinate,<br />
					and that the monsoon made it grow apace,<br />
					so that a creeper sprouted -<br />
					tender, young, downy, and clinging -<br />
					which fastened on to that sāl-tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, the resident deity might then think,<br />
					did my friends and kinsfolk assemble to allay my alarm<br />
					with cheerful ...<br />
					might never germinate?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant indeed are the embraces of this<br />
					tender, young, downy, and clinging creeper!</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now that creeper should enfold the tree,<br />
					growing into a canopy over the top<br />
					and into a dense growth beneath,<br />
					till it had strangled every mighty branch and stem.</p>

					<p class="f4">Well might that deity then think<br />
					that this was what prompted his friends and kinsfolk<br />
					to assemble to allay his alarm<br />
					with their cheerful hopes that ...<br />
					might never germinate.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, here the tree<br />
					would find itself experiencing anguish and torment,<br />
					all because of that creeper's seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just the same<br />
					with those recluses and brahmins<br />
					who maintain and hold ...<br />
					because and by reason of these pleasures of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first way of professing a Doctrine, -<br />
					the way which is pleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens unto Ill thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching the second way of professing a Doctrine,<br />
					the way which is unpleasant both now and hereafter,<br />
					take the case of a devotee,<br />
					naked, flouting the decencies of life ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.012.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 12</a>) ...<br />
					down to the water punctually thrice before night- <a id="pg221"><span class="f2 g"><b>[221]</b></span></a> fall<br />
					to wash (away the evil within).</p>

					<p class="f4">After this wise,<br />
					in divers fashions,<br />
					does the devotee live to torment and to torture his body;<br />
					and after death<br />
					at the body's dissolution<br />
					he passes to states of woe and suffering<br />
					or to purgatory,<br />
					where he experiences anguish and torment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second way of professing a Doctrine,<br />
					the way which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripens to pain thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching the third way,<br />
					take the case of a man<br />
					by nature prone to passion -<br />
					to wrath -<br />
					to delusion -,<br />
					who time after time<br />
					suffers the pains of body and mind<br />
					which each of these three things continually breeds,<br />
					but yet - albeit with pain of body and mind,<br />
					albeit with tears and wailing -<br />
					lives the higher life<br />
					in all its consummate purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man, after death,<br />
					at the body's dissolution,<br />
					passes to a happy state in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third way of professing a Doctrine,<br />
					the way which is unpleasant for the time being<br />
					but ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lastly, take a man who is by nature<br />
					not prone to passion<br />
					or wrath<br />
					or delusion<br />
					and who suffers therefrom<br />
					no pains of body or mind,<br />
					but, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy ...<br />
					(etc., as in <a href="mn.004.chlm.sbb.htm">Sutta 4</a>)<br />
					... the Fourth Ecstasy,<br />
					the state that, knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a man, after death,<br />
					at the body's dissolution,<br />
					passes to a happy state in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth way of professing a Doctrine,<br />
					the way which is both pleasant for the time being<br />
					and ripens to be pleasant thereafter.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, Brethren, are the four ways to profess a Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord. Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
