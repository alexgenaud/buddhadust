					the Lord announced to the Almsmen<br />
					that he would expound<br />
					how plastic forces arose;<br />
					and thus began:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who possesses faith and virtue,<br />
					instruction,<br />
					munificence,<br />
					and understanding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The wish comes to him<br />

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Lord Chalmers here has both reverted to his previous translation of Sankhārā as 'plastic forces' and taken on to that the definition of it as being faith, virtue, instruction, munificence and understanding. This is not supported by the Pali. There is no 'these five Sankhārā' there. The 'wherever are these Sankhārā' refers back to the previous set (fixing his heart, setting his heart, training his heart in this translation). He confirms his error in the following case.</p>
