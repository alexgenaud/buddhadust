					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī<br />
					in the Old Pleasaunce<br />
					in the Palace which Migara's mother gave,<br />
					there, came to him the brahmin Gaṇaka-Moggallāna,<br />
					who, after exchange of greetings,<br />
					seated himself to one side,<br />
					saying: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just, Gotama, as this palace gives evidence of skill,<br />
					execution and progress<br />
					developing right up to the final stair, -<br />
					so brahmins show a like<br />
					gradual growth of skill,<br />
					execution and progress<br />
					both in learning the scriptures<br />
					and in skill at arms<br />
					and also in the mathematics<br />
					of those of us who are accountants<br />
					and make our living by accountancy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For when we take pupils to teach,<br />
					we begin by making them count like this, -<br />
					one,<br />
					once;<br />
					two,<br />
					twice;<br />
					three,<br />
					thrice;<br />
					four,<br />
					four times;<br />
					five,<br />
					five times;<br />
					six,<br />
					six times;<br />
					seven,<br />
					seven times;<br />
					eight,<br />
					eight times;<br />
					nine,<br />
					nine times;<br />
					ten,<br />
					ten times;<br />
					and we take them to a hundred.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Can this Doctrine and Rule of yours, Gotama,<br />
					show a like gradual growth in skill,<br />
					execution and progress?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt2" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg2"><span class="f2">[2]</span></a> Yes,<br />
					it can, brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as a skilful horse-breaker<br />
					when a fine thoroughbred colt is put in his hands,<br />
					begins by schooling it to the bit<br />
					and then proceeds to further stages, -<br />
					so does the Truth-finder begin<br />
					his schooling of the human novice in his charge<br />
					by telling the Almsman to be virtuous,<br />
					to control his life by the canon law,<br />
					to behave aright,<br />
					to be fearful of little faults<br />
					and to live by the precepts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This done, the Truthfinder proceeds with further schooling<br />
					by telling him to guard the portals of sense<br />
					and, when his eye sees a thing,<br />
					not to be carried away<br />
					either by its general presentment<br />
					or by its detailed features;<br />
					and - inasmuch as, without control,<br />
					the eye might overwhelm a man<br />
					with appetites and dejection<br />
					and with bad and wrong dispositions -<br />
					so to live as to control the eye,<br />
					to guard it,<br />
					and to establish control over it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as with the eye,<br />
					so with the ear<br />
					and the other five organs of sense,<br />
					he should live to establish control over each of them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the Almsman can guard the portals of sense,<br />
					the Truth-finder proceeds with a further schooling<br />
					by telling him to be temperate in eating<br />
					and to take food purposely and philosophically,<br />
					not for pleasure<br />
					or for delight<br />
					or for ostentation<br />
					or for display,<br />
					but only to support and maintain his body,<br />
					to save <a id="pg156"><span class="f2 g"><b>[156]</b></span></a> it from harm,<br />
					and to aid the higher life -<br />
					his object herein being<br />
					to put from him the old feelings<br />
					and not to allow any new feelings to arise,<br />
					to the end that the blameless lot may be his<br />
					and well-being.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When <a id="pt3" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg3"><span class="f2">[3]</span></a> the Almsman is temperate in his eating,<br />
					the Truth-nnder proceeds with a further schooling<br />
					by telling him to live the vigilant life,<br />
					purging his heart at all seasons<br />
					of rebellious thoughts,<br />
					whether - by day<br />
					or in the first watch of the night -<br />
					he paces to and fro or sits down,<br />
					or whether - in the middle watch of the night -<br />
					he lies on his right side<br />
					in the lion posture<br />
					with foot on foot,<br />
					mindful and purposeful,<br />
					having appointed when he will arise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the Almsman is vigilant,<br />
					the Truth-finder proceeds with his further schooling<br />
					by telling him to be always mindful and purposeful,<br />
					acting mindfully and purposefully<br />
					whether in going forward or back,<br />
					in looking before or behind,<br />
					in drawing in or stretching out his limbs,<br />
					in conduct of cloak bowl and robes,<br />
					in eating and drinking,<br />
					in chewing and tasting,<br />
					in attending to the needs of nature,<br />
					in walking or standing still,<br />
					in sitting or lying down,<br />
					asleep or awake,<br />
					speaking or silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the Almsman is mindful and purposeful,<br />
					the Truth-finder proceeds with his further schooling<br />
					by telling him to choose for himself a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket or on bracken in the open.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself after his meal<br />
					cross-legged and with body erect,<br />
					with his heart set on mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His life is without appetite<br />
					for things of the world,<br />
					for he has purged away all appetite.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has put away all spite<br />
					and is inspired by no spiteful thought<br />
					but only with lovingkindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All torpor he has put from him;<br />
					all torpor has gone out of his life;<br />
					by insight,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by self-collectedness<br />
					he has purged his heart of torpor.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Worry is his no longer,<br />
					for he has put worry out of his life;<br />
					his heart within him is tranquil and quit of all worry.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Misgivings he has shed<br />
					and outgrown;<br />
					no questions <a id="pg157"><span class="f2 g"><b>[157]</b></span></a> harass him;<br />
					by right dispositions<br />
					he has purged his heart of all misgivings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt4" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg4"><span class="f2">[4]</span></a> When he has put from him these five Hindrances<br />
					and has understood how the heart's shortcomings weaken it,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong dispositions,<br />
					the Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">By shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">By putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such, brahmin, is my schooling<br />
					of those who are still under training<br />
					and are not yet emancipate,<br />
					but are in quest of union with utter Peace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As for those who are arahats,<br />
					in whom the Cankers are no more,<br />
					who have lived the highest life,<br />
					whose task is done,<br />
					who have won their weal<br />
					and outworn the Fetters that bind man to existence,<br />
					who are Delivered by the plenitude of Knowing, -<br />
					for such, these qualities conduce<br />
					both to well-being here and now<br />
					and also to mindfulness and self-collectedness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point the brahmin asked the Lord whether,<br />
					with this guidance and instruction by him,<br />
					all his disciples<br />
					or only some of them<br />
					won the ultimate goal of Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Some do, brahmin,<br />
					and some do not.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What, Gotama,<br />
					is the cause and condition why,<br />
					though Nirvana exists<br />
					and the road to it exists<br />
					and you show the way,<br />
					it is only some<br />
					and not all disciples who,<br />
					with this guidance and instruction,<br />
					succeed in winning the ultimate goal of Nirvana?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That leads me to ask you, brahmin,<br />
					a counter-question,<br />
					which please answer as you deem fit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you think you know the road to Rājagaha?</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt5" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg5"><span class="f2">[5]</span></a> Yes, I do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you, brahmin?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose there came to you<br />
					a man who wanted to go to Rājagaha<br />
					and asked you to tell him the way thither;<br />
					and suppose you told him where his road lay<br />
					and that, if he went a little way along it,<br />
					he would first see a certain village,<br />
					then a certain township a little further on,<br />
					and still a little further on<br />
					he would see Rājagaha<br />
					with all its lovely pleasaunces<br />
					and lovely woods<br />
					and lovely spaces <a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> and lovely lakes;<br />
					and suppose further that,<br />
					with this guidance and instruction from you,<br />
					that man took a cross-road and went west.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose now a second man came to you<br />
					who wanted to go to Rājagaha<br />
					and was by you told the route<br />
					exactly as you had told the first man;<br />
					and suppose that,<br />
					with this guidance and instruction from you,<br />
					he got safely to Rājagaha.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What, brahmin, is the cause and condition<br />
					why, while Rājagaha exists<br />
					and the road to it exists<br />
					and you tell them the way,<br />
					one man takes a cross-road and goes west,<br />
					while another gets safely to Rājagaha?

					<a id="pt6" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg6"><span class="f2">[6]</span></a> Where is my responsibility,<br />
					Gotama? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I only indicate the way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, brahmin,<br />
					while Nirvana exists<br />
					and the road to it exists<br />
					and I tell them the way,<br />
					some of my disciples do,<br />
					and others do not,<br />
					succeed,<br />
					with this guidance and instruction,<br />
					in winning the ultimate goal of Nirvana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where is my responsibility, brahmin?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder only indicates the way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hereupon the brahmin said to the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The reverend Gotama dwells not with those whom<br />
					not faith but search for a livelihood<br />
					impels to go forth as Pilgrims<br />
					from home to homelessness;<br />
					dwells not with cunning and deceitful tricksters,<br />
					vain and puffed-up,<br />
					raucous and babbling,<br />
					keeping no watch over the portals of sense,<br />
					intemperate in their eating,<br />
					devoid of vigilance,<br />
					taking no thought of their vocation<br />
					nor keen in its discipline,<br />
					acquisitive and crafty,<br />
					foremost in backsliding,<br />
					intolerant of the yoke,<br />
					indolent and slack,<br />
					bewildered and flustered,<br />
					unstable and wandering,<br />
					witless and drivelling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gotama dwells only with those young men<br />
					whom faith leads forth as Pilgrims<br />
					from home to homelessness,<br />
					in whom the aforesaid shortcomings find no place<br />
					but only their counterparts in virtue.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as black anusari<br />
					is accounted chief among fragrant roots<br />
					and red sandalwood chief among fragrant woods<br />
					and <a id="pt7" href="../../pali/mn/mn.107.pali.bd.htm#pg7"><span class="f2">[7]</span></a> jasmine chief among fragrant flowers, -<br />
					so is the teaching of the reverend Gotama<br />
					in the van of to-day's gospels.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Wonderful, Gotama;<br />
					wonderful!</p>					

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.</p>
