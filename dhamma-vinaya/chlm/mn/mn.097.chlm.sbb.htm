					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the reverend Sāriputta was making an alms-pilgrimage<br />
					with a great train of Almsmen<br />
					among the Southern Hills,<br />
					where he was found <a id="pt185" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg185"><span class="f2">[185]</span></a> by an Almsman<br />
					who had spent the rainy season at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">After interchange of the greetings of friendliness and civility,<br />
					Sāriputta enquired after the Master's health<br />
					and was told he was well,<br />
					as too was the Confraternity, -<br />
					and also the brahmin Dhānañjāni of Taṇḍula-pālla Gate in Rājagaha<br />
					concerning whose health too Sāriputta had made enquiries.</p>

					<p class="f4">And is the brahmin zealous and earnest? -<br />
					asked Sāriputta further of the Almsman.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could earnest zeal possibly dwell in Dhānañjāni?</p>

					<p class="f4">He uses the king to fleece the brahmins and householders,<br />
					and uses them to fleece the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Also, his pious wife<br />
					who came of a pious stock<br />
					is dead now;<br />
					and he has taken to himself another wife<br />
					who is not pious<br />
					and comes of no pious stock.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is bad news,<br />
					very bad news,<br />
					to hear of Dhānañjāni's lack of zeal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps, however, at some time <a id="pg104"><span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span></a> and place<br />
					I may meet him;<br />
					I should like to have a talk wiih him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After staying as long as he wanted in the Southern Hills,<br />
					Sāriputta proceeded on his alms-pilgrimage<br />
					till he reached Rājagaha,<br />
					where he took up his abode in the Bamboo grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Early in the morning,<br />
					bowl in hand and duly robed,<br />
					he went into Rājagaha for alms,<br />
					<a id="pt186" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg186"><span class="f2">[186]</span></a> at a time when the brahmin Dhānañjāni was out of the city<br />
					seeing his cows milked in the byre.</p>

					<p class="f4">On his return<br />
					after his round and meal,<br />
					Sāriputta sought out the brahmin,<br />
					who, seeing him coming,<br />
					came to meet him with the remark<br />
					that they had time for a draught of milk<br />
					before meal-time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not so, brahmin.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had my meal to-day,<br />
					and shall be resting<br />
					under the shade of a tree<br />
					during the noontide.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come to me there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dhānañjāni agreed<br />
					and after his own meal<br />
					joined Sāriputta,<br />
					seating himself by him after friendly greetings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Sāriputta: -</p>

					<p class="f4">May I rest assured, Dhānañjāni,<br />
					that zeal and earnestness are yours?</p>

					<p class="f4">How can that be,<br />
					when I have to support my parents,<br />
					my wife and family,<br />
					and my slaves and serving folk;<br />
					and have to entertain my acquaintances and friends,<br />
					my kith and kin,<br />
					and guests,<br />
					and have also to provide for my kinsfolk dead and gone,<br />
					and for the deities,<br />
					and for the king, -<br />
					not to speak of supporting myself in meat and drink?</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you,<br />
					Dhānañjāni?</p>

					<p class="f4">If we suppose a man who,<br />
					for his parents' sake,<br />
					has departed from righteousness and equity<br />
					and is being hauled off to purgatory by its wardens, -<br />
					would it avail him<br />
					either to plead on his own behalf<br />
					that it was for his parents' sake<br />
					that he had departed from righteousness and equity<br />
					and that therefore they should not haul him off,<br />
					or <a id="pt187" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg187"><span class="f2">[187]</span></a> for his parents to plead<br />
					that it was for their sake<br />
					he had departed from righteousness and equity?</p>

					<p class="f4">No; despite all appeals,<br />
					the wardens would cast him into purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> Would it avail him either<br />
					to plead on his own behalf,<br />
					or to have his wife and family plead for him,<br />
					that it was for their sake<br />
					he had departed from righteousness and equity?</p>

					<p class="f4">No; despite all appeals,<br />
					the wardens would cast him into purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it avail him<br />
					if he pleaded his slaves and serving folk?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a whit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or if he pleaded his friends and acquaintances?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a whit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or if he pleaded his kith and kin,<br />
					or his guests?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a whit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt188" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[188]</span></a> Or if he pleaded his kinsfolk dead and gone,<br />
					or the deities,<br />
					or his monarch's claims on him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not a whit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would it avail him to plead on his own behalf<br />
					or to have others pleading for him<br />
					that it was to support himself in meat and drink<br />
					that he departed from righteousness and equity?</p>

					<p class="f4">No; despite all appeals,<br />
					they would cast him into purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Dhānañjāni?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the better man? -</p>

					<p class="f4">He that for the sake of his parents<br />
					departs from righteousness and equity?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he that for their sake<br />
					walks in righteousness and equity?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, to walk in righteousness and equity<br />
					is better than to depart therefrom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Moreover, Dhānañjāni,<br />
					there are other courses of action<br />
					which are justified<br />
					and righteous in themselves,<br />
					whereby he can support his parents<br />
					and yet avoid evil-doing<br />
					and walk uprightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, does the same reasoning apply to the support of wife and family,<br />
					<a id="pt189" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg188"><span class="f2">[189 -191]</span></a> and everything else?</p>

					<p class="f4">It does, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the brahmin<br />
					rejoicing in what the reverend Sāriputta had said,<br />
					thanked him,<br />
					rose up and went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">A time came when the brahmin Dhānañjāni,<br />
					being ill and in pain and in grave danger,<br />
					sent a man <a id="pt192" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg192"><span class="f2">[192]</span></a> <a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> to go in his name to the Lord<br />
					and, bowing his head at the Lord's feet,<br />
					to say how ill he was<br />
					and how he bowed his head at the feet of the Lord;<br />
					and further to carry the same message to the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					with the added request to the latter<br />
					to be so good as to come to the house.</p>

					<p class="f4">The two messages having been duly delivered,<br />
					Sāriputta came to Dhānañjāni's house and,<br />
					seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					asked the brahmin whether he was getting better<br />
					and able to hold on,<br />
					whether his pains were leaving him<br />
					and not coming on,<br />
					and whether he found himself progressing<br />
					and not losing ground with his pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not at all, Sāriputta;<br />
					I am getting not better but worse;<br />
					my pains grow worse and worse;<br />
					I am losing ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just like <a id="pt198" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg198"><span class="f2">[198]</span></a> a strong man<br />
					boring my skull with a sword's sharp point,<br />
					so violent are the winds which rack my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am getting worse and not better.</p>

					<p class="f4">My head is racked with violent winds<br />
					as though a strong man had twisted a leather thong round my head.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am getting worse and not better.</p>

					<p class="f4">My inwards are being pierced through and through by violent winds,<br />
					just as if a butcher or his man<br />
					were hacking them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am getting worse and not better.</p>

					<p class="f4">So violent is the fire within me<br />
					that it is just as though a couple of strong men,<br />
					taking a weaker man by both arms,<br />
					were to roast and burn him up in a fiery furnace.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Sāriputta;<br />
					I am not getting better but worse;<br />
					I am losing ground;<br />
					my pains grow on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it better to go to purgatory<br />
					or to be reborn as an animal?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it better to be reborn as an animal<br />
					or as a ghost?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it better to be reborn as a ghost<br />
					or as a human being?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt194" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg194"><span class="f2">[194]</span></a>	As a human being<br />
					or as one of the Four Regents of the world?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As one of the Four Regents<br />
					or as one of the Thirty-three Gods?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As one of the Thirty-three<br />
					or as a God in the Yāma heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a God in the Yāma<br />
					or in the Tusita heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a God in the Tusita<br />
					or in the Nimmānarati heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a God in the Nimmānarati<br />
					or the Paranimmita-vasavatti heaven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The latter.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a God in the Paranimmita-vasavatti heaven<br />
					or in the heaven of Brahmā?</p>

					<p class="f4">You speak of the heaven of Brahmā!</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah! the heaven of Brahmā!</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Sāriputta to himself: -</p>

					<p class="f4">These brahmins' hearts are set on the heaven of Brahmā;<br />
					I might do well to indicate the path<br />
					to union with Brahmās.</p>

					<p class="f4">Accordingly he said he would indicate it to the brahmin and thus began:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt195" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg195"><span class="f2">[195]</span></a>	What is the path to union with the Brahmās?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who dwells with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading one quarter of the world -<br />
					a second quarter -<br />
					a third quarter -<br />
					the fourth quarter;<br />
					who dwells with radiant thoughts of love<br />
					pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere, -<br />
					with thoughts of love all-embracing<br />
					and vast beyond measure,<br />
					untinged by hatred or malice. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a path to union with the Brahmās! -</p>

					<p class="f4">And as with thoughts of love,<br />
					so does the Almsman pervade the whole length and breadth of the world with compassion. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the path to union with Brahmās!</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, Sāriputta,<br />
					bow down your head in my name at the Lord's feet<br />
					and tell him how ill I am<br />
					and that I bow my head at his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg108"><span class="f2 g"><b>[108]</b></span></a> After thus stablishing the brahmin's heart<br />
					not in the highest things of all<br />
					but only in the humble heaven of Brahmā,<br />
					Sāriputta rose<br />
					and went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor had he been gone long<br />
					before the brahmin died and passed away<br />
					to a heaven of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Lord to the Almsmen: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta has risen from his seat and gone his way,<br />
					after stablishing the heart of the brahmin Dhānañjāni<br />
					not in the highest things of all<br />
					but only in the humble heaven of Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">When Sāriputta came up<br />
					and delivered the brahmin's message,<br />
					the Lord asked him to state<br />
					why <a id="pt196" href="../../pali/mn/mn.097.pali.bd.htm#pg196"><span class="f2">[196]</span></a> it was not in the highest things of all<br />
					but only in a humble heaven of Brahmā<br />
					that he had stablished the brahmin's heart<br />
					before leaving him.</p>

					<p class="f4">I thought, sir, that,<br />
					as these brahmins' hearts are set on the heaven of Brahmā,<br />
					I would indicate the path to union with Brahmās.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, and the brahmin has died since, Sāriputta,<br />
					and has passed away to a heaven of Brahmā.</p>
