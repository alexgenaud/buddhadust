					<p class="f4">Once when the venerable Maha Moggallāna was staying in the <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#bhagga">Bhagga</a> country<br />
					at Suɱsumāra-gira in Bhesakaḷā wood in the deer-park,<br />
					he was pacing to and fro in the open<br />
					when Māra, the Evil One, entered his belly<br />
					and got into his stomach.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wondering to himself<br />
					why his belly should feel as heavy<br />
					as if he had had a meal of beans,<br />
					Moggallāna, his walk over,<br />
					went to his cell<br />
					and sat down to think it out by himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Detecting Māra's presence in his inside,<br />
					he exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Begone, Evil Māra;<br />
					begone!</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not annoy a truth-finder<br />
					or a truth-finder's disciple,<br />
					lest you lay up for yourself<br />
					enduring hurt and harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Māra to himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">This recluse says all this<br />
					without knowing or discerning that it is I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, even his master would take time<br />
					to know it was I;<br />
					and how should this disciple know?</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereon, Moggallāna said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, I know you, Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine not that I do not.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are Māra, Evil One;<br />
					and you are thinking<br />
					that it was without <a id="pg240"><span class="f2 g"><b>[240]</b></span></a> knowing or discerning that it was you,<br />
					that I bade you begone<br />
					and not annoy a truth-finder<br />
					or a truth-finder's disciple,<br />
					lest you should lay up for yourself<br />
					enduring hurt and harm;<br />
					but you imagine that even my master<br />
					would take time to know it was you;<br />
					and how should a disciple know?</p>

					<p class="f4">So this recluse really does know and discern<br />
					that it is I, thought Māra;<br />
					and he issued from Moggallāna's mouth<br />
					and perched on the crutch to hold the door-bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing him perched there,<br />
					and informing him that there too<br />
					his presence was detected,<br />
					Moggallāna said:</p>

					<p class="f4">In bygone days, Evil One,<br />
					I myself was a Māra,<br />
					Dūsī by name;<br />
					Kāḷi was my sister's name;<br />
					you were her son<br />
					and so my nephew.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in those days Kakusandha had appeared in the world<br />
					as the Arahat all-enlightened, -<br />
					with Vīdhūra and Sanjīva as his two chief disciples,<br />
					a noble pair.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among all Kakusandha's disciples<br />
					there were none who could compare<br />
					with the reverend Vīdhūra as a preacher of the Doctrine;<br />
					and so he got his name of Vīdhūra (the peerless).</p>

					<p class="f4">The reverend Sanjīva, on the other hand,<br />
					dwelling in the wilds<br />
					or beneath trees<br />
					or in the homes of solitude,<br />
					attained without difficulty<br />
					to cessation of feelings and perception,<br />
					and in this ecstatic state<br />
					was sitting under a tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, as he sat without feelings or perception,<br />
					he was seen by neatherds,<br />
					goatherds,<br />
					ploughmen,<br />
					and wayfarers,<br />
					who marvelled exceedingly at the sight of the recluse -<br />
					sitting there dead,<br />
					as they deemed -<br />
					and set about burning the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they collected bracken<br />
					and sticks<br />
					and dry cowdung<br />
					which they heaped over Sanjīva's body,<br />
					lit the pile,<br />
					and went their way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising from his trance<br />
					when night had passed away,<br />
					Sanjīva shook his raiment<br />
					and in the morning early,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into the village for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight of him on his rounds,<br />
					the neatherds,<br />
					goatherds,<br />
					ploughmen,<br />
					and wayfarers<br />
					marvelled exceedingly to see the recluse<br />
					whom they had deemed to be sitting there dead,<br />
					now alive again<br />
					and quick once more;<br />
					and thus he got the name of Sanjīva (Quick).</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg241"><span class="f2 g"><b>[241]</b></span></a> Thought Dūsī the Māra:</p>

					<p class="f4">I know neither the whence nor the whither<br />
					of these virtuous and good Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me enter into the brahmin-householders<br />
					and incite them to denounce,<br />
					abuse,<br />
					revile,<br />
					and harry these virtuous and good Almsmen<br />
					so that, being thus despitefully treated,<br />
					they may haply change to another frame of mind<br />
					and thus give me my opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Dūsī the Māra entered into those brahmin-householders<br />
					and incited them accordingly;<br />
					and they then proceeded to denounce,<br />
					abuse,<br />
					revile,<br />
					and harry those virtuous and good Brethren in these terms:</p>

					<p class="f4">These shavelings of recluses -<br />
					who are only black riff-raff,<br />
					sprung from the feet of our kinsman Brahmā -<br />
					while professing to be plunged in ecstasies,<br />
					hunch up their shoulders<br />
					and cast down their gaze in their befuddlement<br />
					as they <a id="trance">trance</a><br />
					and en-trance<br />
					and un-trance<br />
					and <a id="de">de-trance</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes! they trance away<br />
					like the owl in trance on a bough -<br />
					on the look-out for a mouse;<br />
					or like the jackal in trance on the river's bank -<br />
					on the look-out for fish;<br />
					or like the cat in trance by scrap-heap or midden -<br />
					on the look-out for a mouse;<br />
					or like the donkey, when at last his yoke is off,<br />
					in trance by the side of scrap-heap or midden.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way these shavelings trance<br />
					and en-trance<br />
					and un-trance<br />
					and de-trance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, the people who die in such a belief,<br />
					all of them,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					pass to re-birth in a doom of suffering and woe<br />
					or purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kakusandha the Lord,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all enlightened,<br />
					addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is Dūsī the Māra<br />
					who has entered into the brahmin-householders<br />
					to incite them to denounce,<br />
					abuse,<br />
					revile,<br />
					and harry<br />
					virtuous and good Almsmen so that,<br />
					being thus despitefully treated,<br />
					they may haply change to another frame of mind<br />
					and thus give him his opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be it yours to dwell with radiant good-will<br />
					pervading first one quarter of the world -<br />
					then the second -<br />
					then the third -<br />
					and then the fourth quarter -<br />
					yea, pervading the whole length and breadth of the world,<br />
					above,<br />
					below,<br />
					around,<br />
					everywhere,<br />
					with radiant good-will<br />
					all- <a id="pg242"><span class="f2 g"><b>[242]</b></span></a> embracing,<br />
					vast,<br />
					boundless,<br />
					wherein no hate or malice finds a place.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, as with good-will,<br />
					so, in turn, be it yours<br />
					to pervade with radiant pity,<br />
					and sympathy,<br />
					and poised equanimity<br />
					the whole length and breadth of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus exhorted and instructed by Kakusandha<br />
					the Lord,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					those Almsmen, Evil One,<br />
					retired to the wilds<br />
					or under trees<br />
					or to homes of solitude<br />
					there to dwell with radiant good-will<br />
					pervading ...<br />
					poised equanimity<br />
					the whole length and breadth of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thought Dūsī the Māra now:</p>

					<p class="f4">I still know naught of the whence<br />
					or the whither<br />
					of these virtuous and good Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, let me enter into the brahmin-householders<br />
					and incite them to pay these Almsmen honour<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship,<br />
					so that, being thus exalted,<br />
					they may haply change to another frame of mind<br />
					and thus give me my opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">When now he had entered into the brahmin-householders accordingly,<br />
					they paid those virtuous and good Brethren honour<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, the people who die in such a belief,<br />
					all of them,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					pass to re-birth in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kakusandha the Lord,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					addressed the Almsmen, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is Dūsī the Māra<br />
					who has entered into the brahmin-householders<br />
					to incite them to pay virtuous and good Almsmen<br />
					honour<br />
					and reverence,<br />
					devotion<br />
					and worship,<br />
					so that, being thus exalted,<br />
					they may haply change to another frame of mind<br />
					and thus give him his opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yours be it to realize the foulness of the body,<br />
					and to perceive how disgusting a thing food is,<br />
					how empty of delight the world is,<br />
					and how fleeting and transitory all things are.</p>

					<p class="f4">Early in the day,<br />
					Kakusandha the Lord,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into the village for alms,<br />
					followed by the reverend Vīdhūra<br />
					as his Almsman in attendance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering into a <a id="pg243"><span class="f2 g"><b>[243]</b></span></a> brahmin lad,<br />
					Dūsī the Māra flung a potsherd<br />
					which hit Vīdhūra's head<br />
					and broke it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Albeit with broken head<br />
					streaming with blood,<br />
					the reverend Vīdhūra still kept following steadily on in Kakusandha's wake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Turning full round,<br />
					as an elephant turns to gaze,<br />
					Kakusandha the Lord,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					exclaimed -</p>

					<p class="f4">This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds!</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as he gazed,<br />
					Dūsī passed out of that existence<br />
					and was reborn in Great Purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Evil One, Great Purgatory bears three names, -<br />
					Sixfold Contact,<br />
					Meeting Spikes,<br />
					and Pang-upon-pang.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the wardens of Purgatory to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">When barb meets barb<br />
					inside your heart,<br />
					then your Excellency will know<br />
					you have been in torment for a thousand years.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tormented was I, Evil One, in Great Purgatory<br />
					for many a long year, -<br />
					for many hundreds of years<br />
					and thousands of years;<br />
					for ten thousand years<br />
					was I tormented in the heart of Great Purgatory,<br />
					suffering pangs that grew and grew.</p>

					<p class="f4">My body was like a man's,<br />
					but my head was like the head of a fish.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> <i>You ask what hell, what torment, Dūsī knew,<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>A hundred barbs of steel it had, and each wrought its own griding agony of pain;<br />
