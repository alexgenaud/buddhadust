					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on the heights of the Vulture's Peak,<br />
					not long after Devadatta's secession,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he addressed the Almsmen on the subject of Devadatta:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> Take the case, Almsmen,<br />
					of a young man who for faith's sake<br />
					goes forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage, -<br />
					feeling himself beset by birth<br />
					and decay<br />
					and death,<br />
					by sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					by ills of body and of mind,<br />
					and by tribulation;<br />
					feeling himself beset by ills,<br />
					spent with ills;<br />
					and asking to be shewn<br />
					how to make an end of all that makes up Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					he finds himself the recipient of presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />
					and repute,<br />
					all of which things so rejoice him<br />
					and so satisfy his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is I, says he to himself,<br />
					who get things given to me<br />
					and who am thought so much of,<br />
					while these other Almsmen<br />
					are little known<br />
					and rank nobodies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intoxicated,<br />
					very much intoxicated,<br />
					with the presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />
					and repute<br />
					which he enjoys,<br />
					he grows remiss<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man<br />
					who was in need, search, and quest<br />
					of the best of wood,<br />
					were to come on just the fine upstanding tree for his purpose,<br />
					but were to disregard not only the best<br />
					but also the poorer timber<br />
					and the bark<br />
					and the wood that had fallen to the ground,<br />
					and were to cut the leafy foliage<br />
					and go off with that<br />
					in the belief that he had got the pick of the wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight,<br />
					an observer with eyes to see<br />
					would say this good man understood nothing<br />
					about grades of wood<br />
					and had gone off with the twiggage<br />
					to the disregard of all the rest, -<br />
					in the vain belief that he had got the pick of the wood; -<br />
					nor would what he had got<br />
					ever be any good to him<br />
					where the best of wood was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it<br />
					with our Pilgrim<br />
					who finds himself the recipient ....<br />
					a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman it is said<br />
					that he has got the twiggage of the higher life<br />
					and has ended there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take now the case of a young man<br />
					who for faiths sake<br />
					goes forth ... that makes up Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					he finds himself the recipient of presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />

					none of which things<br />
					either rejoices his heart<br />
					or satisfies his aspirations,<br />

					as to grow remiss;<br />
					with unremitting zeal he <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> succeeds<br />

					<p class="f4">This success in living the life of virtue<br />

					I am the man of fine character,<br />
					while these other Almsmen lack virtue<br />
					and are of evil character.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intoxicated,<br />
					very much intoxicated,<br />
					with his success in the life of virtue,<br />
					he grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man who was in need, search, and quest ...<br />

					<p class="f4">At the sight,<br />

					nor would what he had got<br />
					ever be of any good to him<br />
					where the best of wood was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it with our second Pilgrim<br />
					who for faith's sake ...<br />
					intoxicated with his success in the life of virtue,<br />
					he grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman it is said<br />

					<p class="f4">Take next the case of a young man<br />

					<p class="f4">This success in living the life of virtue<br />

					to the disparagement of others,<br />

					as to grow remiss;<br />
					with unremitting zeal<br />
					he succeeds in winning rapt concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This success so rejoices him<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others, saying -<br />
					I am the man of sted-fastness,<br />
					I am the man with focussed heart,<br />
					while these other Almsmen are not stedfast<br />
					but all in a whirl.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intoxicated,<br />
					very much intoxicated,<br />
					with winning rapt concentration,<br />
					he grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> It is just as if a man who was in need, search, and quest ...<br />

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it<br />

					who for faith's sake ...<br />
					intoxicated with winning rapt concentration,<br />
					he grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman it is said<br />
					that he has got the bark of the higher life<br />
					and has ended there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take next the case<br />
					of a young man who for faiths sake ...<br />
					succeeds in winning rapt concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This success rejoices him<br />
					but does not so satisfy his aspirations<br />
					as to make him puffed-up<br />
					to the disparagement of others,<br />
					nor is he so intoxicated therewith<br />
					as to grow remiss;<br />
					with unremitting zeal<br />
					he succeeds in winning Mystic Insight.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This success so rejoices his heart<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others, saying -<br />
					I know and see,<br />
					while these other Brethren neither know nor see.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intoxicated,<br />
					very much intoxicated,<br />
					with winning this Insight,<br />
					he grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man who was in need, search, and quest ...<br />
					were to disregard the best timber,<br />
					and were to cut out the poorer timber<br />
					and go off with this<br />
					in the belief that he had got the pick of the wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight,<br />
					an observer with eyes to see<br />
					would say the good man knew nothing<br />
					about grades of wood<br />
					and had gone off with the poorer timber<br />
					in the belief that he had got the pick <a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> of the wood;<br />
					nor would what he had got<br />
					ever be any good to him<br />
					where the best of wood was wanted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it with our fourth Pilgrim<br />
					who for faith's sake ...<br />
					intoxicated with winning Mystic Insight,<br />
					grows remiss,<br />
					and, having become remiss,<br />
					lives a prey to Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of such an Almsman it is said<br />
					that he has got the poorer timber of the higher life<br />
					and has ended there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Next, take the case of the young man who for faith's sake ...<br />
					succeeds in winning Mystic Insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">This success rejoices him<br />
					but does not so satisfy his aspirations<br />
					as to make him puffed-up<br />
					to the disparagement of others,<br />
					nor is he so intoxicated therewith<br />
					as to grow remiss;<br />
					with unremitting zeal<br />
					he succeeds in attaining Temporary<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But it is possible<br />
					he may fall from this Temporary Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man who was in need, search, and quest<br />
					of the best of timber<br />
					were to come on just the fine upstanding tree for his purpose<br />
					and were to cut out the heart of the timber<br />
					and to go off with this<br />
					in the sure knowledge that he had got the heart of the timber.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the sight,<br />
					an observer with eyes to see<br />
					would say that this good man knew quite well<br />
					what was the heart of the timber,<br />
					what was the poorer timber,<br />
					what was the bark,<br />
					what was fallen wood,<br />
					and what was leafy foliage;<br />
					that, being in need, search, and quest of the heart of timber,<br />
					he had cut out only the choicest timber<br />
					and had gone off with that,<br />
					in the full knowledge it was the really best;<br />
					and that what he had got<br />
					would be of good to him<br />
					where the best of timber was needed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just the same is it<br />
					with the young man who goes forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage, -<br />
					feeling himself beset by birth<br />
					and decay<br />
					and death,<br />
					by sorrow and lamentation,<br />
					by ills of body and of mind,<br />
					and by <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> tribulation;<br />
					feeling himself beset by ills<br />
					and spent with ills;<br />
					and asking to be shewn how to make an end of all that makes up Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					he finds himself the recipient of presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />
					and repute,<br />
					none of which so rejoices his heart<br />
					and so satisfies his aspirations<br />
					that thereby he becomes puffed-up<br />
					and disparages others.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not intoxicated with his presents,<br />
					esteem,<br />
					and repute,<br />
					he grows not remiss<br />
					but with unremitting zeal<br />
					wins success first in the life of virtue,<br />
					next in rapt concentration,<br />
					and then in Mystic Insight;<br />
					but his success herein,<br />
					while it rejoices his heart,<br />
					does not satisfy his aspirations<br />
					or puff him up<br />
					or lead him to disparage others;<br />
					it does not intoxicate him<br />
					or make him remiss;<br />
					with unremitting zeal<br />
					he succeeds in winning the Deliverance which is Eternal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is wholly impossible<br />
					that he should fall from Eternal Deliverance.</p>
