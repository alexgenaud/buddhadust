					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> in the Bamboo grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the lay-disciple Visākha came to the Alms woman <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/kd/thig/006.single.verses.htm#XII">Dhammadinna</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> -<br />
					and after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">As regards what is known as personality <i>(sakkāya),</i> madam,<br />
					how has the Lord described its nature?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg214"><span class="f2 g"><b>[214]</b></span></a> He has described it, sir,<br />
					as the Five Attachments to existence, - namely,<br />
					visible shape,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					plastic forces,<br />
					</p>

					<p class="f4">After thanking her, Visākha put to her this further question:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, madam, does the Lord say<br />
					of the origin of personality?</p>

					<p class="f4">He says, sir, that the origin of personality is from cravings, -<br />
					craving for pleasures of sense,<br />
					craving for continued existence,<br />
					craving for annihilation, -<br />
					all entailing re-birth,<br />
					all imbued with passion's delights,<br />
					all seeking pleasure here or there.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, madam, does the Lord say<br />
					of the cessation of personality?</p>

					<p class="f4">He says, sir, that its cessation<br />
					is the complete and passionless cessation<br />
					of just this selfsame craving, -<br />
					its discarding,<br />
					its abandonment,<br />
					its dismissal,<br />
					and its ejection.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what does he say<br />
					about the way that leads to such cessation of personality?</p>

					<p class="f4">He says, sir, that the way is the Noble Eightfold Path, - namely,<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right means of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					and right rapture of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does attachment consist<br />
					of just the Five Attachments you have particularized, madam?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or is there attachment apart from them?</p>

					<p class="f4">Attachment, sir, does not consist<br />
					solely of those five;<br />
					nor yet is there attachment<br />
					wholly apart from them; -<br />
					the desire and passion<br />
					that dwells in the Five Attachments<br />
					is attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">How, madam, does the personality theory arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take, sir, the case<br />
					of an uninstructed everyday man,<br />
					who has no regard for the Noble<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine,<br />
					and who pays no regard to the Excellent<br />
					and is unversed and untrained in their Doctrine; -<br />
					he views material Form as Self,<br />
					or Self as having Form,<br />
					or Form as in Self,<br />
					or Self as in Form.</p>

					<p class="f4">And these views concerning Form<br />
					he extends equally to feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					the plastic forces,<br />
					and consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the personality theory arises.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg215"><span class="f2 g"><b>[215]</b></span></a> And how, madam, does the personality theory not arise?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take, sir, the case<br />
					of an instructed disciple<br />
					who has got regard for the Noble<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine,<br />
					and who has got regard for the Excellent<br />
					and is versed and trained in their Doctrine; -<br />
					he does not view material Form as Self,<br />
					or Self as having Form,<br />
					or Form as in Self,<br />
					or Self as in Form;<br />
					nor does he so view feelings,<br />
					perceptions,<br />
					and the like.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how the personality theory does not arise.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, madam, is the Noble Eightfold Path?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this, sir, -<br />
					right outlook,<br />
					right aims,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right means of livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					and right rapture of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is the Noble Eightfold Path<br />
					create<br />
					or uncreate?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is create.</p>

					<p class="f4">Are three groups included in the Noble Eightfold Path,<br />
					or is the Path included in the groups?</p>

					<p class="f4">They are not included in it;<br />
					it is included in them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					and right means of livelihood<br />
					are included in the virtue-group;</p>

					<p class="f4">right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					and right rapture of concentration<br />
					are included in the concentration-group;</p>

					<p class="f4">while right outlook<br />
					and right aims<br />
					are included in the knowledge-group.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is rapt concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">What are its phenomena?</p>

					<p class="f4">What are its requisites?</p>

					<p class="f4">What cultivates it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Rapt concentration<br />
					is the focussing of the heart;<br />
					its phenomena<br />
					are the fourfold mustering of mindfulness;<br />
					its requisites<br />
					are the four right exertions;<br />
					and the practice and cultivation and increase of these states of consciousness<br />
					cultivate rapt concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many plastic forces are there?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					those of the body,<br />
					of speech,<br />
					and of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are these, severally?</p>

					<p class="f4">Respiration in the case of the body,<br />
					observation and reflection for speech,<br />
					and for the mind perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">How is this,<br />
					in each of the three cases?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg216"><span class="f2 g"><b>[216]</b></span></a> Respiration is a bodily thing<br />
					bound up with the body<br />
					and therefore is the plastic force for the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is because observation and reflection<br />
					precede subsequent utterance<br />
					that they are the plastic forces of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perception and feeling<br />
					are mental things<br />
					bound up with the mind<br />
					and therefore are the plastic forces of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">How comes the ecstatic state<br />
					wherein perception and feeling cease?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not while an Almsman is passing into this ecstatic state<br />
					that the thought comes to him<br />
					that he will pass into it,<br />
					or that he is passing into it,<br />
					or that he has passed into it.</p>

					<p class="f4">No; ere that,<br />
					he has so cultivated his mind<br />
					that it leads him to this result.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is passing into this ecstatic state,<br />
					what plastic forces cease first, -<br />
					those of the body<br />
					or of speech<br />
					or of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of speech first,<br />
					then those of the body,<br />
					and lastly those of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does he emerge from this ecstatic state?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not while he is emerging therefrom<br />
					that the thought comes to him<br />
					that he will emerge,<br />
					or is emerging,<br />
					or has emerged<br />
					from this ecstatic state.</p>

					<p class="f4">No; ere that,<br />
					he has so cultivated his mind<br />
					that it leads him to this result.</p>

					<p class="f4">While he is so emerging,<br />
					what plastic forces revive first?</p>

					<p class="f4">Those of the mind first,<br />
					then those of the body,<br />
					and lastly those of speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has emerged from this ecstatic state,<br />
					how many Contacts affect him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					the emptied,<br />
					the non-characterized,<br />
					and the unsought <i>(appaṇihita).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">When he has emerged,<br />
					towards what is the inclination,<br />
					bent<br />
					and trend of his mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Towards inward aloofness.</p>

					<p class="f4">How many kinds of feelings are there?</p>

					<p class="f4">Three, -<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					unpleasant,<br />
					and neutral.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are they, respectively?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever either mind or body has felt as pleasant <a id="pg217"><span class="f2 g"><b>[217]</b></span></a> and agreeable,<br />
					is a pleasant feeling;<br />
					whatever either mind or body has felt as unpleasant and disagreeable,<br />
					is an unpleasant feeling;<br />
					and whatever either mind or body has felt as neither pleasant nor unpleasant,<br />
					neither agreeable nor disagreeable,<br />
					is neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">What kind of pleasantness or unpleasantness<br />
					is there in each of the three?</p>

					<p class="f4">A pleasant feeling<br />
					is pleasant while it lasts<br />
					and unpleasant when it passes.</p>

					<p class="f4">An unpleasant feeling<br />
					is unpleasant while it lasts<br />
					and pleasant when it passes.</p>

					<p class="f4">A neutral feeling<br />
					is pleasant if comprehended,<br />
					unpleasant if not comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">What propensity lurks<br />
					in each of the three kinds of feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">Passion in pleasant feelings,<br />
					repugnance in unpleasant feelings,<br />
					and ignorance in neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do these several propensities<br />
					always lurk<br />
					in every instance of their respective feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">No.</p>

					<p class="f4">In these several feelings,<br />
					what should be shed,<br />
					respectively?</p>

					<p class="f4">In pleasant feelings,<br />
					the propensity to passion;<br />
					in unpleasant feelings,<br />
					the propensity to repugnance;<br />
					and in neutral feelings,<br />
					the propensity to ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have these several propensities<br />
					always to be shed<br />
					in every instance of their respective feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Not in every instance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from Observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby he sheds passion;<br />
					and here there exists no lurking propensity to passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, oh when, asks he of himself,<br />
					shall I enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					that region where the Noble<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					are even now abiding?</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops such a yearning for utter Deliverance<br />
					that by reason thereof<br />
					he is distressed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby he <a id="pg218"><span class="f2 g"><b>[218]</b></span></a> sheds repugnance;<br />
					and here there exists no lurking propensity to repugnance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who, by putting from him<br />
					both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					has entered on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereby he sheds ignorance;<br />
					and here there exists no lurking propensity to ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to pleasant feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Unpleasant feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to unpleasant feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to neutral feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">Ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to ignorance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to knowledge?</p>

					<p class="f4">Deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to Deliverance?</p>

					<p class="f4">Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the counterpart to Nirvana, madam?</p>

					<p class="f4">You push your question too far, sir;<br />
					you can never get to an end of your questionings.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, in Nirvana the higher life merges<br />
					to find its goal<br />
					and its consummation.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you so desire, sir,<br />
					seek out the Lord and ask him,<br />
					treasuring up the answer he gives.</p>

					<p class="f4">With grateful thanks to the Almswoman Dhammadinna,<br />
					Visākha, the lay-disciple, rose up,<br />
					took his leave of her<br />
					with salutations<br />
					and profound homage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming to the Lord<br />
					and taking his seat to one side<br />
					after due salutation,<br />
					he related the whole of the talk he had had<br />
					with the Almswoman Dhammadinna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the Lord said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">Learning and great knowledge dwell in Dhammadinna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Had you asked me,<br />
					I should make answer precisely as she did.</p>

					<p class="f4">Her answer was correct,<br />
					and you should treasure it up accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, Visākha, the lay-disciple,<br />
					rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
