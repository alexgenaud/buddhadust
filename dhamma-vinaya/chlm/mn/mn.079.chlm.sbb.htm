					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					the Wanderer Sakuludāyi was living with a great company of Wanderers<br />
					in the Wanderers' pleasaunce<br />
					where the peacocks were fed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Early in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord went into Rājagaha for alms<br />
					but, deeming the hour too early as yet for this,<br />
					he bethought him of going to Sakuludāyi in Wanderers Pleasaunce;<br />
					and thither he repaired.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time, Sakuludāyi was sitting with his great company of Wanderers,<br />
					who were making a great noise<br />
					with their voices raised and loud<br />
					in all manner of low and beastly talk, -<br />
					about princes,<br />
					bandits,<br />
					great lords' armies,<br />
					terrors,<br />
					battles,<br />
					meats and drinks,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					beds,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					relations,<br />
					villages,<br />
					townships,<br />
					cities,<br />
					countries,<br />
					women,<br />
					warriors,<br />
					roads,<br />
					wells,<br />
					kinsfolk departed,<br />
					and all the rest of it,<br />
					with chatter about world and ocean,<br />
					and about being and not-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">When from some way off Sakuludāyi saw the Lord coming,<br />
					he hushed his company by saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">Be quiet, sirs;<br />
					do not make a noise;<br />
					here comes the recluse Gotama,<br />
					who is a lover of silence and commends the silent;<br />
					if he observes silence reigning in this gathering,<br />
					he may decide to approach.</p>

					<p class="f4">So they became silent and the Lord came up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said Sakuludāyi:</p>

					<p class="f4">- I pray the Lord to join us;<br />
					he is truly welcome;<br />
					it is a long time since he last managed to come.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray,<br />
					be seated;<br />
					here is a seat for the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord sat down accordingly,<br />
					asking Sakuludāyi,<br />
					who took a low seat to one side,<br />
					what had been their theme<br />
					and what was the discussion<br />
					which had been interrupted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let that pass for the moment,<br />
					answered Sakuludāyi;<br />
					<a id="pt30" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg30"><span class="f2">[80]</span></a> you can easily gather that later on.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, sir, said the Wanderer,<br />
					I am not in act to join my followers,<br />
					they sit talking all manner of beastly talk;<br />
					but when I am approaching,<br />
					they sit with their gaze fixed on me alone,<br />
					to hear what Doctrine I shall expound.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when <a id="pt31" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg31"><span class="f2">[31]</span></a> the Lord approaches us,<br />
					then both I and they<br />
					all sit with gaze fixed on the Lord alone,<br />
					to hear what Doctrine he will expound.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be it yours, Udāyi,<br />
					to open against me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of late, sir,<br />
					there has been one who,<br />
					professing to know and see everything,<br />
					with nothing further to know and see,<br />
					declares that,<br />
					whether walking or standing still,<br />
					whether asleep or awake,<br />
					his ken and vision are always at the full.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I asked him a question about the past,<br />
					he skipped from one thing to another<br />
					and dismissed the matter,<br />
					evincing irritation,<br />
					bad temper and resentment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thoughts of the Lord<br />
					brought me satisfaction<br />
					as I said to myself:</p>

					<p class="f4">Ah, the <a id="pg17"><span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span></a> Lord,<br />
					the Blessed One!</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows aright these states of mind!</p>

					<p class="f4">And who was that person?</p>

					<p class="f4">It was Nātaputta, sir,<br />
					the Jain.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man recalls his own past existences,<br />
					from one onwards,<br />
					in all their details and features,<br />
					he either questions me<br />
					or is by me questioned on the past,<br />
					and either his exposition satisfies me<br />
					or mine him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or if a man, with the Eye Celestial<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					can observe creatures<br />
					in act to pass hence and re-appear elsewhere<br />
					according to their respective deserts,<br />
					<a id="pt32" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg32"><span class="f2">[32]</span></a> he either questions me<br />
					or is by me questioned<br />
					on the past,<br />
					and either his exposition satisfies me<br />
					or mine him.</p>

					<p class="f4">But let past and future alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will preach the Doctrine to you: -</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">If <i>that</i> is,<br />
							<i>this</i> comes about;<br />
							the rise of <i>that</i> makes <i>this</i> arise;<br />
							if <i>that</i> is not,<br />
							<i>this</i> comes not about;<br />
							the ceasing of <i>that</i> makes <i>this</i> cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">For my own part, sir,<br />
					I cannot recall all that has happened to me<br />
					in this present life,<br />
					much less recall my past existences<br />
					in all their details and features,<br />
					as the Lord can.</p>

					<p class="f4">I cannot see a hobgoblin,<br />
					much less can I see with the Eye Celestial -<br />
					as the Lord can -<br />
					creatures passing hence<br />
					and reappearing elsewhere<br />
					according to their respective deserts.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I am wholly at a loss<br />
					to follow the Lord's utterance<br />
					about this and that.</p>

					<p class="f4">I should like to satisfy the Lord<br />
					about our own tenets<br />
					by an answer to a question.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do your tenets say?</p>

					<p class="f4">Our tenets say: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is perfection;<br />
					here is perfection!</p>

					<p class="f4">What is this perfection?</p>

					<p class="f4">The perfection than which<br />
					nothing is higher or more excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is this perfection<br />
					than which nothing is higher or more excellent?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt33" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg33"><span class="f2">[33]</span></a> The perfection than which<br />
					nothing is higher or more excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">This argument of yours,<br />
					Udāyi,<br />
					would be protracted.</p>

					<p class="f4">You affirm perfection<br />
					but never define it.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as <a id="pg18"><span class="f2 g"><b>[18]</b></span></a> if a man were to say<br />
					his longing and his heart's desire<br />
					was for the belle of the land<br />
					but were to confess,<br />
					on being questioned,<br />
					that he did not know<br />
					what rank she belonged to;<br />
					or what her name was;<br />
					or what family she belonged to;<br />
					or whether she was tall,<br />
					short,<br />
					or middle-sized;<br />
					or whether she was black or brown or dusky;<br />
					or what village or township or city she belonged to; - and,<br />
					finally,<br />
					that he did not know her nor had ever seen her.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such a case,<br />
					does not the man's statement prove unhelpful?</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly, sir,<br />
					it would be, -<br />
					in such a case.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way you affirm perfection but never define it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even, sir, as a gem -<br />
					bright and of the purest water,<br />
					with eight facets,<br />
					excellently cut,<br />
					and strung on a yellow thread<br />
					- shines and glitters and sparkles,<br />
					with the like perfection<br />
					shows the hale Self after death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which think you shines and sparkles the most, -<br />
					your gem <a id="pt34" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg34"><span class="f2">[34]</span></a> or the fire-fly of the night?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fire-fly.</p>

					<p class="f4">How does a lamp compare?</p>

					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a conflagration in the night?</p>

					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the morning stars,<br />
					at dawn in a cloudless sky?</p>

					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the full moon<br />
					in a clear sky at midnight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt35" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg35"><span class="f2">[35]</span></a> And the sun at his zenith<br />
					at the end of the rains?</p>

					<p class="f4">Better still.</p>

					<p class="f4">Further, it is within my personal cognizance,<br />
					Udāyi,<br />
					that many, very many, deities<br />
					are so luminous in themselves<br />
					that they draw no light from sun or moon.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I do not speak of a perfection<br />
					than which nothing is higher or more excellent,<br />
					whereas you declare your perfection to be less than,<br />
					and inferior to,<br />
					a fire-fly,<br />
					but never define it.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has settled it!|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has settled the question!|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you mean?|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg19"><span class="f2 g"><b>[19]</b></span></a> I mean that though our tenets say:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here is perfection,<br />
					here is perfection,<br />
					yet, when pressed,<br />
					examined and questioned by the Lord<br />
					concerning our tenets,<br />
					we prove empty and vain and faulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tell me, Udāyi;<br />
					is there a world of absolute bliss?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there a sure way to realize it?</p>

					<p class="f4">Our tenets so declare.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is that sure way<br />
					to realize the world of absolute bliss?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take a man who,<br />
					putting from him all slaying,<br />
					abstains from the taking of life;<br />
					who,<br />
					putting from him the taking of things not given to him,<br />
					abstains from such taking;<br />
					who,<br />
					putting from him sensual misconduct,<br />
					abstains therefrom;<br />
					<a id="pt36" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg36"><span class="f2">[36]</span></a> who,<br />
					putting from him all lying,<br />
					abstains from lies;<br />
					or who practises some austerity he has vowed to observe. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sure way to realize the world of absolute bliss.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you think that,<br />
					when the man puts from him all slaying and abstains from the taking of life,<br />
					his Self finds absolute bliss<br />
					or bliss mingled with pain?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bliss mingled with pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">And is the same true<br />
					of all the other things you mentioned?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you really think it is by mingled bliss and pain<br />
					that the sure way to absolute bliss is found?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord has settled it!</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has settled the question!</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you mean?</p>

					<p class="f4">I mean that,<br />
					though our tenets say there is a world of absolute bliss<br />
					and a sure way to realize it,<br />
					yet,<br />
					when pressed, examined and questioned by the Lord<br />
					concerning our tenets,<br />
					we prove empty and vain and faulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, is there, sir,<br />
					a world of absolute bliss?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is there a sure way to realize it?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt37" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg37"><span class="f2">[37]</span></a> Yes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is that sure way?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who develops in succession<br />
					the first three of the Ecstasies. -</p>

					<p class="f4">That is a sure way<br />
					to realize the world of absolute bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg20"><span class="f2 g"><b>[20]</b></span></a> That is not the sure way, sir,<br />
					to realize the world of absolute bliss;<br />
					for that world would already have been realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Udāyi only the sure way to realize it.</p>

					<p class="f4">At this point Sakuludāyi's following<br />
					broke into tumult and uproar,<br />
					shouting out that they were undone,<br />
					they and their master too,<br />
					for their knowledge ended here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hushing his Wanderers to silence,<br />
					Sakuludāyi asked at what point<br />
					the world of absolute bliss was actually realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">When an Almsman enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy,<br />
					when he stands and talks and holds converse<br />
					with the deities who have passed to a world of absolute bliss,<br />
					then is that world actually realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it in order to realize this world of absolute bliss<br />
					that the Almsmen lead the higher life with the Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, Udāyi;<br />
					there are other states of consciousness<br />
					beyond and above that;<br />
					and it is in order to realize these<br />
					that Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt38" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg38"><span class="f2">[38]</span></a> What are they?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case<br />
					that there appears in the world a Truth-finder,<br />
					Arahat<br />
					all-enlightened,<br />
					walking by knowledge,<br />
					blessed,<br />
					understanding all worlds,<br />
					the matchless tamer of the human heart,<br />
					teacher of gods and men,<br />
					the Lord of Enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This universe -<br />
					with its gods, Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					all this he has discerned<br />
					and realized for himself,<br />
					and makes known to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">He preaches his Doctrine,<br />
					which is so fair in its outset,<br />
					its middle,<br />
					and its close,<br />
					with both text and import;<br />
					he propounds a higher life<br />
					that is wholly complete and pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Doctrine is heard by the head of a house<br />
					or his son<br />
					or by one of other birth,<br />
					who hearing it<br />
					puts his trust in the Truth-finder,<br />
					and in this trust<br />
					bethinks him that -<br />
					A hole and corner life<br />
					is all a home can give,<br />
					whereas Pilgrimage is in the open;<br />
					it is hard for a home-keeping man<br />
					to live the higher life<br />
					in all its full completeness<br />
					and full purity and perfection;<br />
					what if I were to cut off hair and beard,<br />
					don the yellow robes,<br />
					and go forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim?</p>

					<p class="f4">Later, parting from his substance,<br />
					be it small or great,<br />
					parting too from the circle of his kinsfolk,<br />
					be they few or many,<br />
					he cuts off hair and beard,<br />
					dons the yellow robes,<br />
					and goes forth from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>

					<p class="f4">A Pilgrim now,<br />
					schooled in the Almsmens precepts<br />
					and way of life,<br />
					he puts from him all killing<br />
					and abstains from killing anything.</p>

					<p class="f4">Laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					he lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of kindliness and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>

					<p class="f4">Theft he puts from him and eschews;<br />
					taking only what is given to him by others,<br />
					and waiting till it is given,<br />
					he lives an honest and clean life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					all that does not belong to the higher life,<br />
					he leads the higher life in virtue,<br />
					abstaining from low sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Putting from him<br />
					and abstaining from all lying,<br />
					he speaks the truth,<br />
					cleaves to the truth,<br />
					and is staunch and leal,<br />
					never deceiving the world with his lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calumny he puts from him and eschews,<br />
					not repeating elsewhere<br />
					to the harm of people here<br />
					what he hears there,<br />
					nor repeating here<br />
					to the harm of people elsewhere<br />
					what he hears elsewhere;<br />
					thus he heals divisions<br />
					and cements friendship,<br />
					seeking peace<br />
					and ensuing it;<br />
					for in peace is his delight<br />
					and his words are ever the words of a peacemaker.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reviling he puts from him,<br />
					and abstains from reviling people;<br />
					his words are without gall,<br />
					pleasant,<br />
					friendly,<br />
					going home to the heart,<br />
					courteous,<br />
					agreeable<br />
					and welcome to all.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tattle he puts from him<br />
					and abstains therefrom,<br />
					he speaks, in season<br />
					and according to the facts,<br />
					words of help<br />
					concerning the Doctrine<br />
					and the Rule,<br />
					words to be stored in the heart,<br />
					words duly illustrated,<br />
					fraught with purpose,<br />
					and pithy.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sedulously avoids hurting the seeds<br />
					or plants of a village.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes but one meal a day,<br />
					never eating at night<br />
					or after hours.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from looking on at shows of dancing,<br />
					singing,<br />
					and music.</p>

					<p class="f4">He eschews all use and employment<br />
					of smart garlands,<br />
					scents<br />
					and perfumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sleeps on no tall or broad beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refuses to accept gold<br />
					or coins of silver, -<br />
					uncooked grain or meat, -<br />
					women or girls, -<br />
					bondwomen or bondmen, -<br />
					sheep or goats, -<br />
					fowls or swine, -<br />
					elephants or cattle or horses or mares, -<br />
					fields or land.</p>

					<p class="f4">He refrains from the practice<br />
					of sending or going on messages.</p>

					<p class="f4">He neither buys nor sells.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never cheats with weights,<br />
					coins,<br />
					or measures.</p>

					<p class="f4">He takes no part in bribery,<br />
					cozening,<br />
					cheating,<br />
					or other crooked ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">He never joins in wounding,<br />
					murdering,<br />
					and manacling,<br />
					or in highway robbery,<br />
					brigandage,<br />
					and fraud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contented is he<br />
					with whatever robes are given him<br />
					as clothing,<br />
					and with whatever alms are given<br />
					for his belly's needs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a winged bird,<br />
					wheresoever it goes,<br />
					carries with it its feathers and all, -<br />
					so, wheresoever he goes,<br />
					he takes all his belongings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					he enjoys unsullied well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">When with his eye<br />
					he sees a visible shape,<br />
					he is not absorbed by either its general appearance<br />
					or its details;<br />
					but, since the eye uncontrolled<br />
					might lead to covetousness and discontent,<br />
					to evil and wrong states of mind,<br />
					he schools himself to control it,<br />
					to keep watch and ward over it,<br />
					and to establish control.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he does the like<br />
					with his five other faculties of sense.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble control over his faculties,<br />
					he enjoys unalloyed well-being within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Purposeful is he in all his doings, -<br />
					whether in coming in or going out,<br />
					in looking ahead or around,<br />
					in stretching out his arm<br />
					or in drawing it back,<br />
					in wearing his clothes<br />
					or carrying his bowl,<br />
					in eating or drinking,<br />
					in chewing or savouring food,<br />
					in attending to the calls of nature,<br />
					in walking<br />
					or standing<br />
					or sitting,<br />
					in sleeping or waking,<br />
					in speech or in silence; -<br />
					he is always purposeful in all he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">A master of this noble code of virtue,<br />
					a master of this noble code of control of his faculties of sense,<br />
					and a master of noble mindfulness and purpose in all he does,<br />
					he resorts to a lonely lodging, -<br />
					in the forest under a tree,<br />
					in the wilds in cave or grot,<br />
					in a charnel-ground,<br />
					in a thicket,<br />
					or on bracken in the open.</p>

					<p class="f4">After his meal,<br />
					when he is back from his round for alms,<br />
					he seats himself cross-legged<br />
					and with body erect,<br />
					with his heart set on mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">His life is purged<br />
					(i.) of appetite for things of the world,<br />
					for he has put from him<br />
					all appetite therefor; -<br />
					(ii.) of all spiteful thoughts,<br />
					for he is filled only with loving-kindness<br />
					and compassion for all that lives; -<br />
					(iii.) of all torpor,<br />
					for all torpor has left him,<br />
					driven out by clarity of vision,<br />
					by mindfulness,<br />
					and by purpose in all he does; -<br />
					(iv.) of ail flurry and worry,<br />
					for he is serene,<br />
					and his heart within is at peace<br />
					and quit of all worries; - and<br />
					(v.) of all doubts,<br />
					for his life is unclouded by doubt,<br />
					he is troubled by no questionings,<br />
					right states of mind<br />
					have purged his heart of all doubting.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman, when he has put from him these Five Hindrances<br />
					and has understood how the heart's shortcomings weaken it,<br />
					then, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					he enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the First Ecstasy. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Almsman rising above reasoning and reflection,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of rapt concentration,<br />
					above all observation and reflection,<br />
					a state whereby the heart is focussed<br />
					and tranquillity reigns within.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Almsman, by shedding the emotion of zest,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Third Ecstasy,<br />
					with its poised equanimity,<br />
					mindful and self-possessed,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					the satisfaction of which the Noble say<br />
					that poise and mindfulness bring abiding satisfaction.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again, the Almsman, by putting from him both satisfaction and dissatisfaction,<br />
					and by shedding the joys and sorrows he used to feel,<br />
					enters on,<br />
					and abides in,<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy, -<br />
					the state that,<br />
					knowing neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction,<br />
					is the consummate purity<br />
					of poised equanimity and mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">With heart thus stedfast,<br />
					thus clarified and purified,<br />
					clean and cleansed of things impure,<br />
					tempered and apt to serve,<br />
					stablished and immutable, -<br />
					he applies his heart to the knowledge which recalls his earlier existences.</p>

					<p class="f4">He calls to mind his divers existences in the past, -<br />
					a single birth,<br />
					then two ... [and so on to] ... a hundred thousand births,<br />
					many an aeon of disintegration of the world,<br />
					many an aeon of its redintegration,<br />
					and again many an aeon both of its disintegration<br />
					and of its redintegration.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this or that former existence,<br />
					he remembers,<br />
					such and such was my name,<br />
					my sept,<br />
					my class,<br />
					my diet,<br />
					my joys and sorrows,<br />
					and my term of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I passed thence,<br />
					I came by such and such subsequent existence,<br />
					wherein such and such was my name and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thence I passed to my life here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus does he call to mind his divers existences of the past<br />
					in all their details and features.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he now applies to knowledge of the passage hence,<br />
					and re-appearance elsewhere,<br />
					of other beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the Eye Celestial,<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye,<br />
					he sees beings in the act of passing hence<br />
					<a id="pg21"><span class="f2 g"><b>[21]</b></span></a> and of re-appearing elsewhere, -<br />
					beings high and low,<br />
					fair or foul to view,<br />
					in bliss or woe;<br />
					he sees them all faring according to their past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here were beings given over to evil<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who decried the Noble<br />
					and had a wrong outlook<br />
					and became what results from such wrong outlook -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of suffering,<br />
					misery<br />
					and tribulation<br />
					and in purgatory.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here again were beings given to good<br />
					in act, word and thought,<br />
					who did not decry the Noble,<br />
					who had the right outlook<br />
					and became what results from right outlook; -<br />
					these, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					made their appearance in states of bliss in heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">All this does he see with the Eye Celestial;<br />
					and this is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same stedfast heart<br />
					he next applies to knowledge of the eradication of Cankers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comprehends,<br />
					aright and to the full,<br />
					I11,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course that leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He comes to know Cankers as what they really are,<br />
					<a id="pt39" href="../../pali/mn/mn.079.pali.bd.htm#pg39"><span class="f2">[39]</span></a>, to know their rise,<br />
					their cessation,<br />
					and the course which leads to their cessation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he knows and sees this,<br />
					his heart is Delivered from the Canker of pleasures of sense,<br />
					from the Canker of continuing existence,<br />
					and from the Canker of ignorance;<br />
					and to him thus delivered<br />
					comes the knowledge of his Deliverance<br />
					in the conviction that rebirth is for him no more,<br />
					that he has lived the highest life,<br />
					that his task is done,<br />
					and that now for him<br />
					there is no more of what he has been. -</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a state of consciousness beyond and above,<br />
					for the realization of which<br />
					Almsmen lead the higher life with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereon, the Wanderer Sakuludāyi said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir,<br />
					wonderful!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if a man should set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I ask to receive admission as a Pilgrim,<br />
					with confirmation therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereon, Sakuludāyi's company of Wanderers besought and implored him<br />
					not to lead the higher life with the recluse Gotama;<br />
					not to come down from teacher to pupil, -<br />
					from pitcher to pipkin.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did the Wanderer Sakuludāyi's company<br />
					oppose his choice of the higher life under the Lord.</p>
