					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord addressed the Almsmen as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sāriputta, Almsmen, has learning and understanding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sāriputta's understanding is vast and extensive,<br />
					joyous and swift,<br />
					acute and penetrating.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For a whole fortnight continuously<br />
					he had unbroken insight into the Doctrine,<br />
					with the following experiences therefrom. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Divested of lusts<br />
					and of wrong dispositions,<br />
					Sāriputta developed and dwelt in the First Ecstasy<br />
					and all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of aloofness,<br />
					not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All the concomitants of the First Ecstasy -<br />
					thought and reason,<br />
					zest and satisfaction,<br />
					unity of heart and mind,<br />
					contact,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					thinking,<br />
					heart,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					decision,<br />
					energy,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					poise and mentality, -<br />
					all these qualities were his;<br />
					he saw all these in turn arise,<br />
					play their part<br />
					and pass away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There came to him the knowledge<br />
					that thus all of these were not,<br />
					but came to be,<br />
					and make themselves known<br />
					by coming to be.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So without any leaning to these qualities<br />
					or aversion from them,<br />
					without dependence on them,<br />
					and without being enamoured of them,<br />
					he lived detached and separate,<br />
					with his heart untrammelled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He knew well that beyond all this<br />
					there was a further refuge, -<br />
					to be found,<br />
					he thought to himself,<br />
					by growth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Again, by laying to rest observation and reflection,<br />
					he developed and dwelt<br />
					in that inward tranquillity<br />
					and focussing of heart <a id="pt26" href="../../pali/mn/mn.111.pali.bd.htm#pg26"><span class="f2">[26]</span></a>,<br />
					beyond observation and reflection,<br />
					which is bred of rapt concentration<br />
					and is the Second Ecstasy<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All the concomitants of the Second Ecstasy -<br />
					inward tranquillity,<br />
					zest and satisfaction,<br />
					unity of heart and mind,<br />
					contact,<br />
					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					thinking,<br />
					heart,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					<a id="pg171"><span class="f2 g"><b>[171]</b></span></a> decision,<br />

					mindfulness,<br />
					poise and mentality -<br />
					all these qualities were his;<br />
					he saw all these in turn arise,<br />
					play their part<br />

					<p class="f4">There came to him the knowledge<br />
					that thus all of these were not,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again,<br />
					Sāriputta losing the passion for satisfaction,<br />
					dwelt in neutrality,<br />
					mindful and alive to everything,<br />
					feeling in his frame<br />
					that ease which the Noble Ones mean<br />
					when they say: -<br />
					He that has poise and mindfulness<br />
					lives at ease;<br />
					and so he developed the Third Ecstasy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All the concomitants of the Third Ecstasy -<br />

					unity of heart and mind,<br />

					feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					thinking,<br />
					heart,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					decision,<br />
					energy,<br />
					poise and mentality, -<br />
					all these qualities were there continuously<br />
					he saw all these in turn arise,<br />
					play their part<br />
					and pass away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There came to him the knowledge<br />
					that thus all of these were not,<br />

					to be found,<br />
					he thought to himself,<br />
					by growth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Again, by discarding ease and unease,<br />
					by the disappearance<br />
					of both pleasant and unpleasant emotions,<br />
					Sāriputta developed<br />
					and dwelt in<br />
					the Fourth Ecstasy<br />
					in perfect poise and mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All those concomitants of the Fourth Ecstasy -<br />
					poise,<br />
					feelings neither of ease nor of unease,<br />
					superiority thereto<br />
					and cessation of all interest therein,<br />
					unalloyed mindfulness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Again, by rising at every point<br />
