					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#kosala">Kosala</a> at Naḷaka-pāna in the Butea grove,<br />
					there were a number of highly distinguished young men<br />
					who for the Lord's sake<br />
					through faith in him<br />
					had gone from home to homelessness as Pilgrims, -<br />
					the reverend Anuruddha,<br />
					Nandiya,<br />
					Kimbila,<br />
					Bhagu,<br />
					Kundadhana,<br />
					Revata,<br />
					and Ānanda,<br />
					together with other highly distinguished young men.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the time the Lord <a id="pt463" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg463"><span class="f2">[463]</span></a>,<br />
					sitting in the open air<br />
					in the midst of the Confraternity,<br />
					asked the Almsmen whether those young men,<br />
					as Almsmen,<br />
					found joy in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsmen were silent,<br />
					and silent they remained<br />
					though asked the same question a second<br />
					and a third time.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it occurred to the Lord<br />
					to put the question direct<br />
					to those young men themselves,<br />
					and he asked Anuruddha<br />
					whether they found joy in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Certainly we do, was the answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Good, very good, Anuruddha<br />
					and the others of you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is meet and right<br />
					that you should do so.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have left home<br />
					for homelessness as Pilgrims<br />
					when quite young -<br />
					with black hair untouched by grey<br />
					and in all the beauty of your early prime -<br />
					at the very age when you might have been<br />
					leading a life of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was under no stress from kings or robbers,<br />
					or debt or fear,<br />
					or poverty<br />
					that you left your homes; -<br />
					did you not in faith go forth as Pilgrims<br />
					because - feeling beset by birth, decay and death,<br />
					by grief,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					ills,<br />
					woes and tribulation,<br />
					beset by ills and spent with ills, -<br />
					you were asking to be shown<br />
					how to make an end<br />
					of all that makes up the sum of Ill?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what,<br />
					when enrolled as a Pilgrim,<br />
					has that young man to do?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on the one hand,<br />
					he attains not <a id="pg330"><span class="f2 g"><b>[330]</b></span></a> to that zest and satisfaction<br />
					which is divested of pleasures of sense<br />
					and all wrong states of consciousness,<br />
					if he attains not to this<br />
					or to something higher still,<br />
					his heart is possessed by covetise,<br />
					malevolence,<br />
					torpor,<br />
					flurry and worry,<br />
					doubts,<br />
					<a id="pt464" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg464"><span class="f2">[464]</span></a> dislikes<br />
					and slackness.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he does attain<br />
					to such zest and satisfaction,<br />
					or to something higher still,<br />
					his heart is not possessed<br />
					by any of these things.</p>

					<p class="f4">That zest<br />
					and that satisfaction<br />
					are his.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your idea about myself?</p>

					<p class="f4">As touching the Cankers -<br />
					which are depraved and entail re-birth,<br />
					which are burthensome<br />
					and ripen unto Ill,<br />
					with birth,<br />
					decay<br />
					and death<br />
					in their train-,<br />
					do you think that these have not been put away from him<br />
					by the Truth-finder<br />
					and that this is why he knows<br />
					that this Canker is dealt with by practice,<br />
					that by endurance,<br />
					this by avoidance<br />
					and that by removal?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir; we do not think this.</p>

					<p class="f4">What we think is<br />
					that the Truth-finder has put away from him<br />
					all Cankers<br />
					and that this is why he knows<br />
					how Cankers are severally to be dealt with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Right, quite right.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Truth-finder has indeed put from him<br />
					all these evil Cankers,<br />
					has grubbed and stubbed them,<br />
					like a palm-tree that has been rooted out<br />
					from where it stood,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a palm<br />
					with its crown lopped off<br />
					can never grow again,<br />
					even so have all these evil Cankers<br />
					been grubbed and stubbed,<br />
					like a palm that has been rooted out<br />
					from where it stood,<br />
					a thing that once has been<br />
					and now can be no more.</p>

					<p class="f4">And therefore it is<br />
					that the Truth-finder knows<br />
					how Cankers are severally to be dealt with.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think ye?</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>"future state" is not in the Pali, and it would not be a future state. The Pali is <i>'Asu amutra upapanno, asu amutra upapanno'</i>: "That [one] [has] arisin that place; that [one] [has] arisen that place." Translating literally would have forced the reader to imagine inflection and jesture.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">With what end in view<br />
					does the Truth-finder indicate the states hereafter<br />
					of his disciples dead and gone,<br />
					declaring that this one has passed to one,<br />
					and that one to an other<br />
					future state?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt465" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg465"><span class="f2">[465]</span></a> All our ideas are derived from the Lord,<br />
					guided by him<br />
					and fortified by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">We pray that the Lord<br />
					may be pleased to explain what he has said,<br />
					so that the Almsmen may treasure up his words.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg331"><span class="f2 g"><b>[331]</b></span></a> My end in view is not to cajole or delude folk,<br />
					nor is it to get for myself gains or repute or fame or profit,<br />
					nor is it to advertise myself<br />
					as revealing the respective states hereafter<br />
					of my disciples dead and gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">No; it is because there are young men who believe<br />
					and are filled with enthusiasm<br />
					and with gladness,<br />
					who, on hearing this revelation,<br />
					concentrate their whole hearts on imitating it all, -<br />
					to their own abiding good and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Almsman hears<br />
					that such and such an Almsman has died<br />
					and has been declared by the Lord<br />
					to have been stablished in knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">From personal observation<br />
					or from hearsay<br />
					he knows what was this departed Almsman's conduct,<br />
					peace of heart,<br />
					lore,<br />
					life,<br />
					and Deliverance;<br />
					and when he recalls the faith,<br />
					virtue,<br />
					learning,<br />
					renunciation<br />
					and lore of the departed,<br />
					he concentrates his whole heart<br />
					on becoming like him,<br />
					so that his life is blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or the Almsman hears<br />
					the Lord has declared that,<br />
					by having burst asunder the Five Bonds<br />
					which bound him to the world,<br />
					the Almsman departed<br />
					has been translated to a heaven<br />
					never to come back thence to earth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From personal observation ...<br />
					life is blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he hears the Lord has declared that,<br />
					by having burst asunder the Three Bonds,<br />
					and by also reducing passion, hatred and delusion to a minimum,<br />
					the Almsman departed<br />
					will come back only once more to earth,<br />
					and will, when he comes back that last time,<br />
					make an end of Ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">From personal observation ...<br />
					<a id="pt466" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg466"><span class="f2">[466]</span></a> life is blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or he hears the Lord has declared that,<br />
					by having simply burst asunder the Three Bonds,<br />
					the Almsman departed<br />
					has embarked on the stream of salvation,<br />
					is safe from future states of punishment,<br />
					is sure of his future<br />
					and destined to win full enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">From his personal observation ...<br />
					life is blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, an Almswoman hears the Lord has declared<br />
					that such and such an Almswoman<br />
					has died and has been declared by the Lord<br />
					(etc., as in all the four foregoing cases of the Almsman departed).</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg332"><span class="f2 g"><b>[332]</b></span></a> <a id="pt467" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg467"><span class="f2">[467]</span></a> Similarly a lay-follower - man or woman -<br />
					hears that such and such a lay-follower has died<br />
					and that the Lord has declared that,<br />
					by having burst asunder the Five Bonds which bound him - or her - to the world,<br />
					the departed has been translated to a heaven<br />
					never to come back thence to earth ...<br />
					(etc., as in the 2nd., 3rd. and 4th. cases of the Almsman departed) ...</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt468" href="../../pali/mn/mn.068.pali.bd.htm#pg468"><span class="f2">[468]</span></a>	his - or her - whole heart<br />
					is concentrated on becoming like him - or her -,<br />
					so that his - or her - life is blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the Truth-finder's end in view<br />
					is not to cajole or delude folk,<br />
					nor is it to get for himself gains or repute or fame or profit,<br />
					nor is it to advertise himself<br />
					as revealing the respective states hereafter<br />
					of his disciples dead and gone.</p>

					<p class="f4">No; it is because there are young men who believe<br />
					and are filled with enthusiasm and gladness,<br />
					who, on hearing this revelation,<br />
					concentrate their whole hearts<br />
					on becoming like these, -<br />
					to their own abiding good and welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Anuruddha rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
