<meta name="description" content="The Lord Chalmers translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 18. The Buddha cuts off an argumentative questioner by telling him that in his teaching there is no arguing with anyone about anything and by this he is free. In repeating the insident to the bhikkhus he is questioned as to what this teaching is that argues with no one about anything. The Buddha explains in brief that it is by having no interest in the obsessions and perceptions that assail the mind. Then further the bhikkhus ask for a clarification of this of Maha Kaccana, who speaks of the obsessions and perceptions that arise from sense experience." />

					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan pleasaunce,<br />
					he went, duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					into the city for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the end of his round,<br />
					when his meal was over<br />
					and he was on his way back,<br />
					he came to Great Wood<br />
					and entering it seated <a id="pg76"><span class="f2 g"><b>[76]</b></span></a> himself for the noontide<br />
					at the foot of a young Vilva tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too Daṇḍapāṇi the Sakyan,<br />
					who was on his wanderings and peregrinations<br />
					afoot in the forest,<br />
					came also to Great Wood<br />
					and, entering it,<br />
					drew near to the Lord under his tree,<br />
					and, after exchange of civil greetings,<br />
					stood to one side<br />
					with his hands leaning on his staff,<br />
					to ask:</p>

					<p class="f4">What are your tenets, recluse?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your gospel?</p>

					<p class="f4">Tenets, sir, whereby<br />
					not only is a man at strife with no world whatsoever<br />
					throughout the whole universe -<br />
					with its gods,<br />
					Māras,<br />
					Brahmās,<br />
					recluses and brahmins,<br />
					embracing all gods and mankind, -<br />
					but also he as (a true) Brahmin<br />
					dwells above all pleasures of sense,<br />
					without perplexities<br />
					and with a clear conscience,<br />
					without any cravings to be reborn<br />
					either here or there,<br />
					immune from assaults of the perceptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, sir, are my tenets;<br />
					and this is my gospel.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words Daṇḍapāṇi shook his head,<br />
					waggled his tongue<br />
					and departed,<br />
					still leaning on his staff,<br />
					with his brow puckered into three wrinkles.</p>

					<p class="f4">Towards evening,<br />
					arising from his meditations,<br />
					the Lord made his way to the Banyan pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					he told the Almsmen the incident in full detail.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had done so,<br />
					a certain Almsman asked what precisely were the tenets<br />
					whereby the Lord was at strife with no world<br />
					and how he as the true Brahmin<br />
					dwelt above all pleasures of sense<br />
					without perplexities ...<br />
					assaults of the perceptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever be the origin, Almsman,<br />
					of the several obsessions,<br />
					bred of perceptions,<br />
					which beset a man's path,<br />
					yet, if they find neither approval<br />
					nor welcome<br />
					nor adherence,<br />
					then here at once is an end of all propensities to passion,<br />
					to resentment,<br />
					to speculative ideas,<br />
					to doubts,<br />
					to pride,<br />
					to passion for continuing existence,<br />
					and to ignorance;<br />
					it is the end of taking up cudgel<br />
					or knife,<br />
					of quarrels,<br />
					of contentions,<br />
					of strife,<br />
					of wrangling,<br />
					slander,<br />
					and lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Herein, all these evil and wrong states of mind<br />
					are quelled and pass away entirely.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg77"><span class="f2 g"><b>[77]</b></span></a> So spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, getting up from his seat,<br />
					the Blessed One went to his cell.</p>

					<p class="f4">He had not been gone long<br />
					when those Almsmen bethought them<br />
					how tersely<br />
					and without detailed exposition<br />
					the Lord had propounded this theme<br />
					ere withdrawing to his cell;<br />
					and they were wondering who would expound to them<br />
					the meaning of the Lord's pregnant utterance,<br />
					when the idea came to them<br />
					that the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					who was praised by the Master<br />
					and was held in high honour<br />
					among the most able of his fellows in the higher life,<br />
					could give them that detailed exposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">So to Mahā-Kaccāna they went,<br />
					laid the whole matter before him,<br />
					and asked him to expound accordingly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Really, sirs, said he,<br />
					it is as if a man who was in need and search and quest of choice timber<br />
					were to come on just the fine upstanding tree for his purpose<br />
					but were to disregard its root and trunk<br />
					and to imagine he could find his choice timber<br />
					among the branches and foliage.</p>

					<p class="f4">For, this is just what your reverences have come to,<br />
					in that, with the Master there in front of you,<br />
					you have ignored him<br />
					and come to ask me what he meant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sirs, the Lord knows with all knowing<br />
					and sees with all seeing, -<br />
					being the embodiment of vision,<br />
					insight,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and all excellence;<br />
					he is the propounder<br />
					and expounder<br />
					and unfolder<br />
					of meanings,<br />
					the giver of Nirvana's ambrosia,<br />
					lord of the Doctrine,<br />
					the Truth-finder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then was the time to address your questions to the Lord in person,<br />
					in order to treasure up what he might reveal.</p>

					<p class="f4">Admitting all this,<br />
					the Almsmen still pressed Mahā-Kaccāna to consent to expound and elucidate it for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he, consenting, spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">I take, sirs, the detailed meaning of the Lord's pregnant utterance to be this.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is because of the eye<br />
					and of visible forms<br />
					that visual consciousness arises;<br />
					the meeting of these three things is contact;<br />
					contact conditions feeling;<br />
					what a man feels,<br />
					he perceives;<br />
					what he perceives,<br />
					he reasons about;<br />
					what he reasons about,<br />
					he is obsessed by;<br />
					from what obsesses him<br />
					<a id="pg78"><span class="f2 g"><b>[78]</b></span></a> originate the several obsessions,<br />
					bred of perceptions,<br />
					which beset a man's path<br />
					in respect of visible forms,<br />
					past<br />
					present<br />
					or future,<br />
					which are cognizable by the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">So too, it is because of ear and sounds<br />
					that auditory consciousness arises;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of nose and odours that olfactory consciousness arises;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of tongue and tastes that gustatory consciousness arises;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of body and tangible things that there arises tactile consciousness;</p>

					<p class="f4">because of mind and mental objects that there arises mental consciousness;<br />
					the meeting of these three things is contact;<br />
					contact conditions feeling ... mental objects,<br />
					past,<br />
					present<br />
					or future,<br />
					which are cognizable by the mind.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Where eye and visible form are present with visual consciousness,<br />
					there a man may recognize the manifestation of contact;<br />
					where there is the manifestation of contact,<br />
					there a man may recognize the manifestation of feeling -<br />
					and so of perception,<br />
					reasoning,<br />
					and obsession.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the three factors must all be present together,<br />
					or there can be no manifestation to recognize.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the like holds good<br />
					of each of the other senses,<br />
					including mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, sirs, is what I take to be the detailed meaning of the Lord's pregnant utterance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, should your reverences so desire,<br />
					you can go to the Lord himself<br />
					and address your questions to him in person,<br />
					in order to treasure up what he may reveal.</p>

					<p class="f4">After expressing their gratification<br />
					and gratitude<br />
					to the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna,<br />
					those Almsmen rose and went to the Lord,<br />
					to whom they explained at length<br />
					how, to get a detailed interpretation of his pregnant utterance,<br />
					they had betaken themselves to the reverend Mahā-Kaccāna<br />
					and how in what sentences and words<br />
					he had expounded the meaning to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Mahā-Kaccāna, said the Lord, has learning and <a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> great insight.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were to put your question to me,<br />
					my explanation would tally with his;<br />
					for this is the right meaning<br />
					and you should so treasure it up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the venerable Ānanda said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a man who,<br />
					being half-dead with hunger and exhaustion,<br />
					should come on a honeyed cake,<br />
					each bit he tastes bringing in on him more and more<br />
					its sweet delicious savour, -<br />
					even so, the further the mind of a competent Almsman penetrates<br />
					into the import of the lore<br />
					of the exposition of the Doctrine,<br />
					the greater grows his gratification<br />
					and gladness of heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, sir, is the name of this exposition?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well, Ānanda, let it be known as<br />
					the exposition of 'the honeyed cake.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
