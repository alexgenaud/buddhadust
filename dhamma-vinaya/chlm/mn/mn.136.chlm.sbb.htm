					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at Rājagaha<br />
					in the Bamboo grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					there was living in the Forest Hut there the reverend Samiddhi, -<br />
					to whom in the course of his walks<br />
					came Potali-putta the Wanderer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sitting down after greetings,<br />
					Potali-putta said to Samiddhi: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the recluse Gotama's own lips<br />
					I have heard with my own ears<br />
					his statement that:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">All you do is vain,<br />
					and all you say is vain;<br />
					what passes in your mind<br />
					is the only real thing that matters.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A stage can be reached<br />
					in which there is no feeling whatever.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do not say this,<br />
					reverend Potali-putta;<br />
					do not say this;<br />
					do not misrepresent the Lord;<br />
					for the Lord certainly would not say that.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How long have you been a Pilgrim,<br />
					reverend Samiddhi?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not long, sir; -<br />
					three years.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why shall we speak on this matter with Elders,<br />
					when here is so recent an Almsman<br />
					ready to defend the Master against criticism?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Tell me, reverend Samiddhi,<br />
					- what does a man experience<br />
					who acts with body voice or mind,<br />
					of set purpose?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He experiences what is unpleasant. <a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> Hereupon, Potali-putta the Wanderer,<br />
					neither expressed satisfaction nor dissent,<br />
					but simply rose up and went away.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not long after Potali-putta had gone,<br />
					Samiddhi went to the reverendĀnanda<br />
					<a id="pt208" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg208"><span class="f2">[208]</span></a> and, after greetings,<br />
					took a seat beside him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ānanda, after hearing the whole of the talk with Potali-putta,<br />
					said this was a thing to tell the Lord,<br />
					to whom accordingly he took Samiddhi<br />
					that they might learn the Lord's view.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When they came to the Lord's presence<br />
					and had taken their seats beside him after salutations,<br />
					Ānanda reported the whole of the conversation to the Lord,<br />
					who rejoined that he disapproved of Potali-putta's conclusion<br />
					and still more<br />
					of such an argument as this.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why, said he, this foolish Samiddhi<br />
					has given a simple direct reply<br />
					to a question by Potali-putta<br />
					which required careful qualifications in the answer!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At this point the reverend (Lola) Udāyi said to the Lord: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But how, sir, if the purport<br />
					of the reverend Samiddhi's words<br />
					was that Ill in general<br />
					was always the outcome<br />
					of feelings experienced?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the Lord to Ānanda: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Mark this foolish Udāyi's error;<br />
					I knew in advance<br />
					that this foolish person would pop up with a blunder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Potali-putta's question really involved three distinct sets of feelings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If foolish Samiddhi,<br />
					<a id="pt209" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg209"><span class="f2">[209]</span></a> when confronted with that triple question,<br />
					had made the following reply: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If his purposeful act<br />
					with body voice or mind<br />
					is calculated to produce a pleasant feeling,<br />
					his experience is pleasant;<br />
					if the act is calculated to produce an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					his experience is unpleasant:<br />
					if the act is calculated to produce neither a pleasant nor an unpleasant feeling,<br />
					then his experience is neither pleasant nor unpleasant;<br />
					- had foolish Samiddhi given this answer,<br />
					he would have been giving the right answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet who, Ānanda,<br />
					among the blind and foolish Wanderers of other creeds,<br />
					will comprehend the Truth-finder's<br />
					detailed Classification of Acts,<br />
					if you were to hear it from his lips?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now is the time. Lord,<br />
					now is the time for the Lord<br />
					to expound his classification.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Almsmen will <a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> treasure in their memories<br />
					what they hear from the Lord's lips.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well then, Ānanda,<br />
					listen attentively<br />
					and 1 will speak.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, was the reverend Ānanda's dutiful response;<br />
					and the Lord spoke thus: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are four (types of) individuals<br />
					living and existent in the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are the four? </p>
					
					<p class="f4">(i) Take the case of an individual here<br />
					who slays,<br />
					gives not,<br />
					fornicates,<br />
					lies,<br />
					traduces others,<br />
					reviles them,<br />
					tattles,<br />
					covets,<br />
					is malevolent of heart<br />
					and wrong in his outlook. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					passes hence to misery and woe or to purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(ii) Or, again, such an individual<br />
					may pass hence to bliss in heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iii) Take now the case<br />
					of an individual who never slays,<br />
					who gives freely,<br />
					who never fornicates,<br />
					or lies,<br />
					or traduces,<br />
					<a id="pt210" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg210"><span class="f2">[210]</span></a> who never reviles,<br />
					never tattles<br />
					or covets<br />
					or is malevolent of heart,<br />
					but is right in his outlook. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					passes hence to bliss in heaven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(iv) Or, again, such an individual<br />
					may pass hence to misery and woe or purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case, Ānanda,<br />
					of a recluse or brahmin who,<br />
					by reason of ardour,<br />
					effort,<br />
					devotion,<br />
					perseverance<br />
					and highest intellection,<br />
					reaches such rapt concentration<br />
					that, with heart thus stedfast, he sees -<br />
					by the Eye Celestial<br />
					that is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye -<br />
					our first individual,<br />
					who was of murderous habits and so forth<br />
					and who had the wrong outlook,<br />
					sees him now<br />
					in a state of misery and woe or in purgatory;<br />
					and the sight convinces him<br />
					that there are such things as evil deeds,<br />
					and that wrong courses<br />
					come to their ripening.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, with his own eyes<br />
					he has seen an evil-doer<br />
					installed after death<br />
					in purgatory!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly,<br />
					the only sound conclusion to his mind<br />
					is that all such evil-doers<br />
					come to this doom hereafter, -<br />
					any other conclusion being wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus it is with obstinacy tenacity and pertinacity<br />
					that he insists that what he has<br />
					known seen and discerned for himself<br />
					is the sole truth,<br />
					all else being false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second recluse or brahmin<br />
					<a id="pt211" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg211"><span class="f2">[211]</span></a> similarly comes to <a id="pg275"><span class="f2 g"><b>[275]</b></span></a> see our second individual,<br />
					who was of murderous habits and so forth<br />
					and who had the wrong outlook,<br />
					now in a state of bliss in heaven;<br />
					and the sight convinces him<br />
					that there are no such things as evil deeds,<br />
					nor do wrong courses come to their ripening.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, with his own eyes<br />
					he has seen an evil-doer<br />
					installed after death in bliss in heaven!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, to his mind<br />
					the only sound conclusion<br />
					is that all sucn evil-doers are similarly rewarded hereafter, -<br />
					any other conclusion being wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus it is with obstinacy tenacity and pertinacity<br />
					that he insists that<br />
					what he has known seen and discerned for himself<br />
					is the sole truth,<br />
					all else being false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A third recluse or brahmin<br />
					similarly comes to see<br />
					in the bliss of heaven after death<br />
					our third individual,<br />
					who never took life and so forth<br />
					and had the right outlook.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is thereby convinced<br />
					that there are such things as good deeds<br />
					and that right courses<br />
					come to their ripening.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For with his own eyes<br />
					he has seen a good-liver<br />
					installed after death<br />
					in bliss in heaven!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, to his mind<br />
					the only sound conclusion<br />
					is that all such good-livers<br />
					are similarly rewarded hereafter, -<br />
					any other conclusion being wrong.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus it is with obstinacy tenacity and pertinacity<br />
					that he insists that<br />
					what he has known seen and discerned for himself<br />
					is the sole truth,<br />
					all else being false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A fourth recluse or brahmin<br />
					comes to see <a id="pt212" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg212"><span class="f2">[212]</span></a> in misery and woe or in purgatory after death<br />
					our fourth individual,<br />
					who never took life and so forth<br />
					and had the right outlook;<br />
					and the sight convinces him<br />
					that there are no such things as good deeds<br />
					nor do right courses<br />
					come to their ripening!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, with his own eyes<br />
					he has seen a good-liver<br />
					installed after death<br />
					in misery and woe or purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Accordingly, to his mind<br />
					the only sound conclusion<br />
					is that all such good-livers<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus it is with obstinacy tenacity and pertinacity<br />
					that he insists that<br />
					what he has known seen and discerned for himself<br />
					is the sole truth,<br />
					all else being false.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, Ānanda,<br />
					I agree with that recluse or brahmin<br />
					who says that there are such things as good deeds<br />
					and <a id="pg276"><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></a> right courses coming to their ripening;<br />
					I agree too<br />
					with him when he says<br />
					he has seen in purgatory<br />
					a man of murderous habits and so forth<br />
					who had the wrong outlook;<br />
					I disagree with him<br />
					when he asserts that<br />
					this is the fate of all such persons;<br />
					I disagree with him<br />
					both when he asserts that his conclusion is the only sound one, -<br />
					any other conclusion being wrong, -<br />
					and also when he insists so obstinately<br />
					that truth resides exclusively<br />
					in what he has personally known seen and discerned for himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And why?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, Ānanda,<br />
					the conclusion is different<br />
					in the Truth-finder's classification of acts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am in disagreement<br />
					with the recluse or brahmin<br />
					who says there are no such things as evil deeds,<br />
					nor do wrong causes come to their ripening;<br />
					but I agree with him when he says<br />
					he has seen in heaven<br />
					a man of murderous habits and so forth<br />
					who had the wrong outlook.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I disagree with him<br />
					both when he asserts ... <a id="pt213" href="../../pali/mn/mn.136.pali.bd.htm#pg213"><span class="f2">[213]</span></a> classification of acts.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am in agreement with the recluse or brahmin<br />
					who says that there are such things as good deeds<br />
					and that right courses come to their ripening;<br />
					and I am in agreement with him<br />

					<p class="f4">I disagree with him<br />

					<p class="f4">And why?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because, Ānanda,<br />

					<p class="f4">Begin, Ānanda,<br />
					with the man of murderous habits here and so forth<br />
					and with the wrong outlook,<br />
					who, at <a id="pg277"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span></a> the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					is reborn into a state of misery and woe or in purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This man either aforetime<br />
					(in a previous birth),<br />
					or thereafter<br />
					(in his latest existence here),<br />
					did evil deeds which result in painful experiences,<br />
					or else at the time of his death<br />
					had a wrong outlook<br />
					in which he persisted of his deliberate choice; -<br />
					and that is why,<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death,<br />
					he is reborn into a state of misery and woe or in purgatory.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His murderous habits and so forth<br />
					and his wrong outlook<br />
					are experienced in their ripening<br />

					<p class="f4">If, with murderous habits here and so forth<br />

					into a state of bliss in heaven,<br />
					that is because,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, with non-murderous habits here and so forth<br />
