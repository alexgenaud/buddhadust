					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					he addressed the listening Almsmen as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">While the five Fallows of his heart are left untilled<br />
					and its five Bondages are unshattered,<br />
					no Almsman can possibly shew growth,<br />
					increase<br />
					and progress<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five Fallows he leaves untilled?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who feels doubts and <a id="pg72"><span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span></a> misgivings<br />
					about the Master,<br />
					without either certainty or conviction,<br />
					so that in this frame of mind,<br />
					his heart has no bent towards ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion;<br />
					this marks the first Fallow untilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or suppose he feels these same doubts and misgivings<br />
					about the Doctrine -<br />
					or the Confraternity -<br />
					or his course of training,<br />
					with the same lack of bent towards ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion; -<br />
					this marks the second - the third - and the fourth Fallow untilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fifth is when he is angry with his fellows in the higher life,<br />
					is displeased with them,<br />
					is upset about them,<br />
					and fallow - as it were - in his relations to them,<br />
					so that he has no bent towards ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five Bondages he leaves unshattered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman who,<br />
					in the matter of sensuous pleasure,<br />
					is not void of passion and appetite,<br />
					fondness<br />
					and yearning,<br />
					thirsting,<br />
					feverish longings<br />
					and craving;<br />
					in this frame of mind,<br />
					his heart has no bent towards ardour and so forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">This marks the first Bondage unshattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he is in like case<br />
					in the matter of the body -<br />
					or of visible forms, -<br />
					this marks the second and the third, respectively,<br />
					of the heart's Bondages unshattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, again, if after eating as much as ever his belly will hold,<br />
					an Almsman is fond of his chair<br />
					or bed<br />
					or of slumber,<br />
					then his heart's bent<br />
					is not towards ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion;<br />
					and this marks the fourth Bondage unshattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, lastly, an Almsman's ambition in the higher life<br />
					may be for some particular order of gods;<br />
					and so his virtue,<br />
					conversation,<br />
					austerities<br />
					and higher life<br />
					aim at ensuring his becoming a god,<br />
					or some particular god.</p>

					<p class="f4">If such be his aims and ambition,<br />
					then his heart's bent<br />
					is not to ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion;<br />
					and this marks the fifth Bondage unshattered.</p>

					<p class="f4">If, Almsmen, these five Fallows of his heart<br />
					are left untilled,<br />
					and if these five Bondages<br />
					are unshattered,<br />
					no Almsman can possibly shew growth,<br />
					increase<br />
					and progress<br />
					in this Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg73"><span class="f2 g"><b>[73]</b></span></a> If, on the other hand,<br />
					an Almsman has the five Fallows of his heart tilled<br />
					and its five Bondages shattered,<br />
					then it is quite possible for him to shew growth,<br />
					increase<br />
					and progress<br />
					in the Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the five tilled Fallows of the heart?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of an Almsman<br />
					who feels no doubts or misgivings about the Master<br />
					but feels certainty and conviction,<br />
					so that his heart is bent on ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion, -<br />
					this marks the first Fallow tilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he feels no doubts or misgivings about the Doctrine -<br />
					or about the Confraternity -<br />
					or about his course of training, -<br />
					and if his heart is bent on ardour,<br />
					zeal,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					and exertion, -<br />
					this marks the second - the third - and the fourth Fallow tilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fifth is when he is not angered against his fellows,<br />
					is not displeased or upset by them,<br />
					nor is he fallow - as it were -<br />
					in his relations to them; -<br />
					this marks the heart's fifth and last Fallow tilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">And similarly with shattering the heart's five Bondages.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the four bases of psychic power,<br />
					in which purpose,<br />
					will,<br />
					thought,<br />
					and study respectively<br />
					inspire what moulds and fashions vigorous concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Strenuousness itself is a fifth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Almsman who is equipped<br />
					with these fifteen<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> factors<br />
					of the strenuous character<br />
					has the capacity for breaking through,<br />
					the capacity for full Enlightenment,<br />
					and the capacity for the Peace beyond compare.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like a hen<br />
					with a clutch of eight<br />
					or ten<br />
					or a dozen eggs,<br />
					on which she has sat closely,<br />
					keeping them as warm as may be<br />
					with all her pains and care;<br />
					albeit the wish may arise within her<br />
					that her chicks<br />
					with claw<br />
					or beak<br />
					would break through the shell<br />
					and win forth,<br />
					yet that hen's chicks are capable of breaking the shell<br />
					and winning forth<br />
					quite safely; -<br />
					even so, <a id="pg74"><span class="f2 g"><b>[74]</b></span></a> the Almsman who is equipped<br />
					with these fifteen factors of the strenuous character<br />
					is capable of breaking through,<br />
					is capable of full Enlightenment,<br />
					and is capable of the Peace beyond compare.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>I.e.</i> the five tilled Fallows plus the five shattered Bondages plus the four psychic bases; with strenuousness itself added on to the latter as a fifth (<i>Bu.</i> ).</p>
