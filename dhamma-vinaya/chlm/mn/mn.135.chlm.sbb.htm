					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce,<br />
					the young brahmin Subha Todeyya-putta came to the Lord<br />
					and, seating himself to one side after greetings,<br />
					asked why and wherefore it was<br />
					that among human beings<br />
					there are the low and the high.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For, said he, we find in mankind<br />
					those of brief life and those of long life,<br />
					the hale and the ailing,<br />
					the good-looking and the ill-looking,<br />
					the poor and the rich,<br />
					the low and the high,<br />
					the ignorant and <a id="pt203" href="../../pali/mn/mn.135.pali.bd.htm#pg203"><span class="f2">[203]</span></a> the well informed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why and wherefore is it<br />
					that among human beings<br />
					there are high and low?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their deeds are their possessions and heritage,<br />
					their parent,<br />
					their kindred<br />
					and their refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is their deeds<br />
					which divide people into high and low.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I do not follow this terse utterance of yours,<br />
					Gotama, <a id="pg269"><span class="f2 g"><b>[269]</b></span></a> without the addition of an elucidating exposition,<br />
					which I should be glad to receive.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Inviting and receiving the young brahmin's attention<br />
					the Lord spoke as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who slays,<br />
					is cruel,<br />
					dyes hands in blood,<br />
					is always killing and wounding,<br />
					never showing mercy to any living creature. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to misery and woe or to purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then brief life is here his portion<br />
					in whatever station he is born into. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such murderous courses<br />
					tend to brief life here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who - putting all killing from him<br />
					and abstaining from killing anything,<br />
					laying aside cudgel and sword,<br />
					lives a life of innocence and mercy,<br />
					full of pity and compassion<br />
					for everything that lives.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to bliss in heaven;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then length of days is his portion<br />
					in whatever station he is born into. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such merciful courses<br />
					tend to length of days here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt204" href="../../pali/mn/mn.135.pali.bd.htm#pg204"><span class="f2">[204]</span></a> Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who is given to assaulting others<br />
					with fist or clod,<br />
					with cudgel or sword.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to misery and woe or purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					he is always ailing<br />
					in whatever station he is born into.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such assaults<br />
					tend to ailments here. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the person who eschews<br />
					such assaults on others<br />
					either passes at death to bliss in heaven;<br />
					or, if born a man again,<br />
					then good health is his portion. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such harmlessness<br />
					tends to ensure good health here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who is wrathful and turbulent,<br />
					who is moved by a trivial word<br />
					to cursing rage<br />
					enmity<br />
					and opposition,<br />
					who evinces indignation<br />
					ill-will<br />
					and resentment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that <a id="pg270"><span class="f2 g"><b>[270]</b></span></a> person<br />
					at the body's dissolution after death<br />
					to misery and woe, or purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					his portion is to be ugly<br />
					in whatever station he is born into.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such angry courses<br />
					tend to foul looks here. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the person wno is not of that turbulent spirit<br />
					and remains unmoved to rage<br />
					even by a torrent of abuse,<br />
					either passes at death<br />
					to bliss in heaven;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then good looks are his portion<br />
					in whatever station he is born into. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such good-tempered courses<br />
					tend to good looks here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who, being of a jealous nature,<br />
					is jealous and perverted<br />
					in the matter of presents<br />
					and marks of respect<br />
					and worship shown,<br />
					who stores up jealousy in his heart.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person at death<br />
					to misery and woe or purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then, whatever station he is reborn into,<br />
					no notice is taken of him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such jealous courses<br />
					tend to no account being taken of a man here. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt205" href="../../pali/mn/mn.135.pali.bd.htm#pg205"><span class="f2">[205]</span></a> But the person who is of no such jealous disposition,<br />
					either passes at death<br />
					to bliss in heaven;<br />
					or if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then, great account of him is taken<br />
					in whatever station he is reborn into. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such un-jealous courses<br />
					tend to make a man of great account here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who never gives anything -<br />
					food,<br />
					drink,<br />
					clothes,<br />
					carriage,<br />
					garlands,<br />
					scents,<br />
					perfumes,<br />
					bed,<br />
					dwelling-place,<br />
					lamp and oil -<br />
					to recluse or brahmin.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person at death<br />
					to misery and woe or purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then, whatever station he is reborn into,<br />
					he is a poor man.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such refusals to give,<br />
					tend to entail poverty here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if a person is open-handed<br />
					to recluses or brahmins,<br />
					his destiny is either bliss in heaven<br />
					or wealth among men. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Open-handedness tends to wealth here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who, being hard and arrogant,<br />
					refuses salutations<br />
					to one who ought to be saluted,<br />
					does not rise<br />
					for one who <a id="pg271"><span class="f2 g"><b>[271]</b></span></a> should be so received,<br />
					does not give up his seat<br />
					or the road<br />
					to one more worthy,<br />
					shows no respect,<br />
					deference,<br />
					honour<br />
					or worship<br />
					to those who should be shown it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deeds,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person at death<br />
					to misery and woe in purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then, whatever station he is reborn into,<br />
					he is of low and unimportant family.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such arrogant courses<br />
					tend to lowliness here. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But if a person is void of arrogance<br />
					and shows all due regard<br />
					to those who deserve it,<br />
					his destiny is either bliss in heaven<br />
					or high family among men. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such deference<br />
					tends to importance of family.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take the case of anyone - man or woman -<br />
					who, when visiting recluse or brahmin,<br />
					does not question him<br />
					on what is right,<br />
					what is wrong,<br />
					what is faulty,<br />
					what is faultless,<br />
					what should be practised and what not,<br />
					what actions of his<br />
					will conduce to his lasting well-being<br />
					and welfare<br />
					and what to the reverse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such courses,<br />
					if persisted in of deliberate choice,<br />
					either bring that person at death<br />
					to misery and woe in purgatory;<br />
					or, if his rebirth is again among mankind,<br />
					then, whatever station he is reborn into,<br />
					he is ignorant.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such failure to seek information<br />
					tends to ignorance here. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt206" href="../../pali/mn/mn.135.pali.bd.htm#pg206"><span class="f2">[206]</span></a>	But if a person seeks information by such questionings,<br />
					his destiny is either to find bliss in heaven after death<br />
					or to be well-informed here,<br />
					whatever his station. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">An enquiring spirit<br />
					tends to make a man well-informed here.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus, young brahmin,<br />
					it is the courses<br />
					that respectively tend thereto,<br />
					which result in brief life<br />
					or length of days,<br />
					in health or ill-health,<br />
					in ugliness or good looks,<br />
					in being of no account or of great account,<br />
					in being poor or rich,<br />
					of low family or high,<br />
					ignorant or well-informed. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Their deeds are their possessions and heritage,<br />
					their parent and their kindred and their refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is their deeds which divide people into high and low.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the close,<br />
					the young brahmin Subha Todeyya-putta<br />
					said to the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent, Gotama; excellent!</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg272"><span class="f2 g"><b>[272]</b></span></a> Just as a man might set upright again<br />
					what had been cast down,<br />
					or reveal what was hidden away,<br />
					or tell a man who had gone astray<br />
					which was his way,<br />
					or bring a lamp into darkness<br />
					so that those with eyes to see<br />
					might see the things about them, -<br />
					even so, in many a figure, has the reverend Gotama made his Doctrine clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I come to Gotama as my refuge<br />
					and to his Doctrine<br />
					and to his Confraternity;<br />
					I ask him to accept me as a follower<br />
					who has found an abiding refuge<br />
					from this day onward while life shall last.</p>
