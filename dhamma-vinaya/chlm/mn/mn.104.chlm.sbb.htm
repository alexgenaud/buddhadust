					<p class="f4">Once while the Lord was staying among the Sakyans at Sāmagāma,<br />
					Nātaputta the Nigaṇṭha had died recently at Pāvā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At his death the Nigaṇṭhas were broken up;<br />
					they split into two,<br />
					and led lives of quarrels,<br />
					strife and contentions,<br />
					assailing one another with shafts of wounding speech,<br />
					such as -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You know nothing of this Doctrine and Rule;<br />
					I do, though you never will.<br />
					You walk in error,<br />
					but I aright.<br />
					There is sense in what I say;<br />
					none in what you say.<br />
					You end just where you should begin<br />
					<a id="pt244" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg244"><span class="f2">[244]</span></a> and begin where you should end.<br />
					Your elaborate thesis is knocked endwise;<br />
					your argument is floored;<br />
					and you are beaten.<br />
					Go and learn better,<br />
					or else at once get out of your tangle -<br />
					if you can.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Wholesale slaughter, methinks,<br />
					was afoot among Nstaputta's Nigaṇṭhas!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even the white-clad laity who followed Nātaputta<br />
					evinced the disgust and displeasure and <a id="pg140"><span class="f2 g"><b>[140]</b></span></a> repugnance,<br />
					that must result from a Doctrine and Rule<br />
					so inadequately set forth and expounded,<br />
					so lacking in efficacy<br />
					and prospect of peace for the heart,<br />
					a Doctrine and Rule without an All-enlightened founder,<br />
					and now reft of foundations<br />
					and void of consolation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now Cunda, the novice,<br />
					who had spent the rainy months at Pāvā,<br />
					came to the reverend Ānanda at Sāmagāma<br />
					and reported the foregoing to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ānanda said the story<br />
					was one to bring before the Lord, -<br />
					to whom, in company with Cunda,<br />
					he proceeded and to whom, after salutations,<br />
					<a id="pt245" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg245"><span class="f2">[245]</span></a> he related what he had heard from Cunda, -<br />
					adding his hope that,<br />
					when the Lord died,<br />
					no quarrels would arise in the Confraternity,<br />
					to the general grief<br />
					and sorrow and hurt of many folk<br />
					and to the grief and pain alike of gods and men.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What think you, Ānanda?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you observe even a couple of Almsmen<br />
					at variance about the higher lore I have taught you,<br />
					to wit the four Themes,<br />
					the four Bases of psychic power,<br />
					the fivefold Sphere of sense,<br />
					the five Forces,<br />
					the seven Factors of Enlightenment,<br />
					and the Noble Eightfold Path?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But those who are about the Lord might,<br />
					at his death,<br />
					stir up quarrels in the Confraternity<br />
					respecting rigours of the regimen<br />
					or of the Code (<i>pāṭimokkha</i>).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such quarrels would make for the general grief<br />
					and sorrow and hurt of many folk,<br />
					and the grief and pain alike of gods and men.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of little concern, Ānanda,<br />
					are quarrels respecting rigours of regimen<br />
					or of the Code;<br />
					it is possible quarrels in the Confraternity<br />
					about the Path<br />
					or the course of training<br />
					which really matter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are six roots<br />
					from which disputes grow, Ānanda. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take, first, a man of wrath and nasty temper,<br />
					who shows no respect or obedience to the Master<br />
					or the Doctrine<br />
					or the Confraternity,<br />
					and does not carry out his course of training to the full.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the kind of man<br />
					who <a id="pt246" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg246"><span class="f2">[246]</span></a> breeds disputes,<br />
					to the general grief<br />
					and sorrow and hurt of many folk,<br />
					and the grief and pain alike of gods and men;<br />
					and if you detect -<br />
					<a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> within yourself or without -<br />
					such a root of quarrels,<br />
					then strive to extirpate the evil thing;<br />
					for, if you succeed in detecting it,<br />
					that particular root of disputes<br />
					will not sprout into anything<br />
					to trouble your lives thereafter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the same applies<br />
					to the five other roots of disputes,<br />
					in men that are hypocritical and fraudulent;<br />
					envious and jealous;<br />
					guileful and deceitful;<br />
					full of evil desires and wrong views;<br />
					or absorbed in temporal ideas<br />
					which they hug tightly<br />
					and will not loose their hold. -</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt247" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg247"><span class="f2">[247]</span></a> These are the six roots from which disputes grow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are four Adjudications <i>(adhikaraṇa),</i><br />
					relating severally to disputes,<br />
					censure,<br />
					transgressions and obligations;<br />
					and there are seven settlements of Adjudications,<br />
					for settling and deciding Adjudications,<br />
					as they arise from time to time.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A summary verdict<br />
					with parties present<br />
					may be given;<br />
					or an innocence verdict;<br />
					or a verdict of past insanity;<br />
					confession may be admitted;<br />
					a Chapter's decision may be taken;<br />
					also there is specific wickedness;<br />
					and there is covering up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a summary hearing<br />
					come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose there is a dispute between Almsmen<br />
					as to what is and what is not the Doctrine or Rule.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The whole body of Almsmen is to meet<br />
					and thresh the matter out<br />
					in the light of the Doctrine,<br />
					till there is agreement,<br />
					and then to settle it conformably with such agreement.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a summary hearing comes about<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by summary hearing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a Chapter's decision come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If the local Almsmen cannot settle the matter locally,<br />
					they are to go where there are a larger number of Almsmen in residence;<br />
					and there the whole conjoint body is to assemble<br />
					and thresh the matter out<br />
					in the light of the Doctrine,<br />
					till there is agreement<br />
					and then to settle it conformably with such agreement.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a majority agreement comes about<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by a Chapter's decision.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> How does innocence come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose Almsmen charge an Almsman<br />
					with this or that grave transgression<br />
					or offence meriting expulsion<br />
					or bordering on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If when they ask him to remember<br />
					whether he has been guilty of this,<br />
					he says he has no remembrance of it,<br />
					<a id="pt248" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg248"><span class="f2">[248]</span></a> he may be given a verdict of innocence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a protestation of innocence comes into play,<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by a verdict of innocence of conscience.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does a verdict of past insanity come about? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose Almsmen charge an Almsman<br />
					with this or that grave transgression<br />
					or offence meriting expulsion<br />
					or bordering on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If when they ask him to remember<br />
					whether he has been guilty of this,<br />
					he says he has no remembrance of it;<br />
					and suppose that,<br />
					when he denies it,<br />
					the spokesman presses him to say<br />
					whether he is quite sure<br />
					he has no remembrance of it,<br />
					he replies that,<br />
					being distraught,<br />
					he had perpetrated much<br />
					in act and speech which did not beseem a recluse,<br />
					but that he has no remembrance of it<br />
					and that this particular thing<br />
					was done when he was out of his mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In that event<br />
					he must be given a verdict of past insanity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a verdict of past insanity comes about<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by a verdict of past insanity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How does confession come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose an Almsman,<br />
					whether reproved or not,<br />
					remembers his offence,<br />
					discloses it<br />
					and lays it bare.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He must go,<br />
					with his robe over one shoulder only,<br />
					to a senior Almsman,<br />
					bow down at his feet and then,<br />
					squatting humbly down on his heels<br />
					and with folded palms outstretched,<br />
					say that he has been guilty of a specified offence<br />
					and that he acknowledges it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The senior will then ask him<br />
					if he is fully alive to his guilt;<br />
					and, on his replying that he is,<br />
					will ask whether he will keep watch and ward over himself in future,<br />
					and shall receive an assurance that he will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how confession comes about,<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by confession.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt219" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg219"><span class="f2">[219]</span></a> How does specific wickedness come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose Almsmen charge an Almsman with this or that grave transgression<br />
					or offence meriting expulsion<br />
					or bordering on it,<br />
					and ask him to remember <a id="pg143"><span class="f2 g"><b>[143]</b></span></a> whether he has been guilty of this;<br />
					and suppose he says he has no remembrance of it but,<br />
					being pressed by the spokesman<br />
					to say whether he is quite sure he has no remembrance of it,<br />
					replies that,<br />
					without being asked,<br />
					he will acknowledge having committed<br />
					this or that trivial offence;<br />
					and therefore could not conceivably,<br />
					when specifically asked,<br />
					fail to acknowledge so grave a transgression or offence,<br />
					meriting expulsion<br />
					or bordering on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose the spokesman,<br />
					taking note of his acknowledgment of the trivial offence<br />
					and repudiation of the major charge,<br />
					still presses him to remember<br />
					whether he is quite sure<br />
					he has no remembrance of the major charge,<br />
					and now elicits the answer<br />
					that he does remember being guilty of it<br />
					and that his former denials<br />
					were hasty and did not express his meaning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how recalcitrancy comes about<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by extracting admissions from the recalcitrant.</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a id="pt250" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg250"><span class="f2">[250]</span></a> How does covering up come into play? -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose that Almsmen<br />
					living in contentions and strife and disputes<br />
					collectively perpetrate much in act and speech<br />
					which does not beseem recluses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The whole body is to meet<br />
					and a sage Almsman from among one of the two factions<br />
					is to rise up,<br />
					with robe over one shoulder<br />
					and with folded palms extended,<br />
					and to make known to the Confraternity as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I ask to be heard by the Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Living here in contentions and strife and disputes,<br />
					we have perpetrated much in act and speech<br />
					which does not beseem recluses.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If the assembly deems it proper for adoption,<br />
					I, by a covering up motion,<br />
					will, in full conclave,<br />
					set forth,<br />
					both for the others here and for myself,<br />
					their offences and my own, -<br />
					gross sins and mundane offences always excepted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then a sage Almsman from the opposite faction<br />
					is to second the motion in like terms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how the motion for covering-up comes into play<br />
					and this is how some Adjudications are settled,<br />
					namely by covering up (collective shortcomings as with heaped up bracken).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Six in number, Ānanda,<br />
					are the things, in them- <a id="pg144"><span class="f2 g"><b>[144]</b></span></a> selves conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduce to accord,<br />
					harmony,<br />
					concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Firstly,<br />
					an Almsman is instant in acts of love,<br />
					both overtly and in secret,<br />
					to his fellows in the higher life;<br />
					this is a thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Secondly,<br />
					an Almsmen is instant in words of love,<br />
					both overtly and in secret,<br />
					to his fellows in the higher life;<br />
					this is a thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thirdly,<br />
					an Almsman is instant in thoughts of love,<br />
					both overtly and in secret,<br />
					to his fellows in the higher life;<br />
					this is a thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and <a id="pt251" href="../../pali/mn/mn.104.pali.bd.htm#pg251"><span class="f2">[251]</span></a> unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fourthly,<br />
					whatsoever an Almsman receives<br />
					that is lawful and lawfully received,<br />
					this, even to the last crumb in his bowl,<br />
					he shares equally<br />
					and without favour<br />
					among all his virtuous fellows in the higher life;<br />
					this is another thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fifthly,<br />
					an Almsman lives,<br />
					both overtly and in secret,<br />
					in virtue among his fellows<br />
					in the exercise of those virtues<br />
					in their unbroken entirety<br />
					without flaw or blemish,<br />
					which mark the freed man,<br />
					which have been lauded by the wise,<br />
					which are embraced for their own sake<br />
					and lead to rapt concentration; -<br />
					this is another thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sixth,<br />
					an Almsman lives among his fellows,<br />
					both overtly and in secret,<br />
					in the exercise of those Noble views<br />
					which make for salvation<br />
					and lead the man who acts accordingly<br />
					unto the utter destruction of all Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the sixth and last thing,<br />
					in itself conciliatory<br />
					friendly and respectful,<br />
					which conduces to accord<br />
					harmony concord and unity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If, Ānanda,<br />
					you embrace and practise<br />
					these six conciliatory things,<br />
					do you find therein<br />
					anything either small or great<br />
					with which you would not agree?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Therefore, Ānanda,<br />
					embrace and practise<br />
					these six conciliatory things;<br />
					and it will be to your lasting weal and welfare.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverendĀnanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
