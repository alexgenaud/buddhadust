					<p class="f4">Once, when staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#savatthi">Sāvatthī</a> in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce, the Lord,<br />
					early in the morning,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went into the city for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the reverend Ãnanda<br />
					there came a number of Almsmen<br />
					to represent that it was a long time<br />
					since they had heard a discourse on the Doctrine from the Lord<br />
					and that they would like to listen to one from his own lips.</p>

					<p class="f4">In reply, Ānanda told them to repair to the hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka,<br />
					where their wishes might perhaps be gratified;<br />
					and to this they assente'd.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having gone his round for alms in Sāvatthī,<br />
					the Lord, on his return after his meal,<br />
					said to Ãnanda that they would go to the Eastern pleasaunce<br />
					and the mansion of (Visakha) the Mother of Migara.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir, said Ānanda in assent.</p>

					<p class="f4">So thither the Lord went with ḍnanda<br />
					to pass the noontide.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rising towards evening from his meditations,<br />
					the Lord told Ānanda<br />
					they would now go to the Eastern bath to bathe.</p>

					<p class="f4">ḍnanda assenting,<br />
					they went there;<br />
					and, after bathing,<br />
					the Lord came out of the water<br />
					and stood in a single garment<br />
					to dry himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then said Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">The hermitage of the brahmin Rammaka is <a id="pg114"><span class="f2 g"><b>[114]</b></span></a> hard by;<br />
					and a pleasant, agreeable place it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir, be pleased to proceed thither.</p>

					<p class="f4">Silently consenting,<br />
					the Lord went to the hermitage,<br />
					in which a number of Almsmen were then seated,<br />
					discoursing of the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Standing outside the door<br />
					till he knew their discourse was at an end,<br />
					the Lord coughed and tapped on the bar of the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">They opened unto him,<br />
					and he went in,<br />
					seating himself on the seat set for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being seated,<br />
					he asked them what had been their theme<br />
					and what was the topic of their previous talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">They answered that it was on the Lord himself<br />
					that their discourse about the Doctrine had centred, -<br />
					when he arrived in person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Quite right, Almsmen, said he;<br />
					it is meet that you young men<br />
					who have gone forth<br />
					on Pilgrimage from home to homelessness for faith's sake<br />
					should sit talking of the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you meet together,<br />
					you have the choice of two things, -<br />
					either to talk about the Doctrine<br />
					or else to preserve a noble silence.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">There are two quests, Almsmen, -<br />
					the noble and the ignoble.</p>

					<p class="f4">First, what is the ignoble quest?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man who,<br />
					being in himself subject to rebirth,<br />
					pursues what is no less subject thereto;<br />
					who being in himself subject to decay,<br />
					pursues what is no less subject thereto;<br />
					who, being himself subject thereto,<br />
					pursues what is subject to disease - death - sorrow - and impurity.</p>

					<p class="f4">What, you ask, is subject to the round of rebirth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, wives and children,<br />
					bondmen and bondwomen,<br />
					goats and sheep,<br />
					fowls and swine,<br />
					elephants,<br />
					cattle,<br />
					horses and mares,<br />
					together with gold and coins of silver.</p>

					<p class="f4">Although subjection to birth marks all these ties,<br />
					yet a man - himself subject to birth -<br />
					pursues these things with blind and avid appetite.</p>

					<p class="f4">[The same applies<br />
					(i), in full, to decay and impurity and also<br />
					(ii) to disease, death and sorrow,<br />
					with the exception of inanimate gold and coins of silver.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Secondly, what is the noble quest?</p>

					<p class="f4">Take the case of a man who,<br />
					being himself subject to the round of rebirth - decay - disease - death - sorrow - and impurity, <a id="pg115"><span class="f2 g"><b>[115]</b></span></a><br />
					sees peril in what is subject thereto,<br />
					and so pursues after the consummate peace of Nirvana,<br />
					which knows neither rebirth nor decay,<br />
					neither disease nor death,<br />
					neither sorrow nor impurity.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the Noble Quest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, I myself too,<br />
					in the days before my full enlightenment,<br />
					when I was but a Bodhisatta,<br />
					and not yet fully enlightened, -<br />
					I too, being subject in myself to rebirth, decay and the rest of it,<br />
					pursued what was no less subject thereto.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the thought came to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">Why do I pursue what, like myself,<br />
					is subject to rebirth and the rest?</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, being myself subject thereto,<br />
					should I not,<br />
					with my eyes open to the perils which these things entail,<br />
					pursue instead the consummate peace of Nirvana, -<br />
					which knows neither rebirth nor decay,<br />
					neither disease nor death,<br />
					neither sorrow nor impurity?

					<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>There came a time when I,<br />
					being quite young,<br />
					with a wealth of coal-black hair<br />
					untouched by grey<br />
					and in all the beauty of my early prime -<br />
					despite the wishes of my parents,<br />
					who wept and lamented -<br />
					cut off my hair and beard,<br />
					donned the yellow robes<br />
					and went forth from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">A pilgrim now,<br />
					in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Āḷāra Kālāma and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend Kālāma,<br />
					to lead the higher life in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, venerable sir,<br />
					was his answer;<br />
					my Doctrine is such<br />
					that ere long an intelligent man<br />
					can for himself discern,<br />
					realize,<br />
					enter on,<br />
					and abide in,<br />
					the full scope of his master's teaching.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had his Doctrine by heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">So far as regards mere lip-recital<br />
					and oral repetition,<br />
					I could say off the (founder's) original message<br />
					and the elders' exposition of it,<br />
					and <a id="pg116"><span class="f2 g"><b>[116]</b></span></a> could profess,<br />
					with others,<br />
					that I knew and saw it to the full.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then it struck me<br />
					that it was no Doctrine merely accepted by him on trust<br />
					that Āḷāra Kālāma, preached,<br />
					but one which he professed to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after having discerned and realized it for himself;<br />
					and assuredly he had real knowledge and vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to him<br />
					and asked him<br />
					up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized the Doctrine<br />
					he had entered on<br />
					and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of Naught,<br />
					answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Āḷāra Kālāma was not alone in possessing faith,<br />
					perseverance,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					rapt concentration,<br />
					and intellectual insight;<br />
					for, all these were mine too.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why, I asked myself,<br />
					should not I strive to realize the Doctrine<br />
					which he claims to have entered on<br />
					and to abide in<br />
					after discerning and realizing it for himself?</p>

					<p class="f4">Before long,<br />
					indeed very soon,<br />
					I had discerned<br />
					and realized his Doctrine for myself<br />
					and had entered on it<br />
					and abode therein.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I went to him<br />
					and asked him whether this was the point<br />
					up to which he had discerned and realized for himself<br />
					the Doctrine which he professed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He said yes;<br />
					and I said that I had reached the same point for myself.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing, said he,<br />
					a very great thing for us,<br />
					that in you, reverend sir,<br />
					we find such a fellow in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That same Doctrine which I for myself have discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have you for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and abide in;<br />
					and that same Doctrine<br />
					which you have for yourself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on<br />
					and profess, -<br />
					that have I for myself discerned,<br />
					realized,<br />
					entered on,<br />
					and profess.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Doctrine which I know,<br />
					you too know;<br />
					and the Doctrine which you know,<br />
					I too know.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I am,<br />
					so are you;<br />
					and as you are,<br />
					so am I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pray, sir,<br />
					let us be joint wardens of this company!</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did Āḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					being my master,<br />
					set me, his pupil,<br />
					on precisely the same footing as himself<br />
					and show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of Naught<br /> <a id="pg117"><span class="f2 g"><b>[117]</b></span></a> <br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it<br />
					to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came to Uddaka Rāmaputta and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is my wish, reverend sir,<br />
					to lead the higher life<br />
					in this your Doctrine and Rule.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stay with us, ... vision thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I went to Uddaka Rāmaputta<br />
					and asked him up to what point<br />
					he had for himself discerned and realized<br />
					the Doctrine he had entered on and now abode in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Up to the plane of neither perception nor nonperception, answered he.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, I reflected that Uddaka Rāmaputta was not alone<br />
					in possessing faith ... show me great worship.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I bethought me<br />
					that his Doctrine merely led to attaining the plane of neither perception nor non-perception,<br />
					and not to Renunciation,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					cessation,<br />
					peace,<br />
					discernment,<br />
					enlightenment<br />
					and Nirvana, -<br />
					I was not taken with his Doctrine<br />
					but turned away from it to go my way.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still in search of the right,<br />
					and in quest of the excellent road<br />
					to peace beyond compare,<br />
					I came, in the course of an alms-pilgrimage through Magadha,<br />
					to the Camp township at Uruvela<br />
					and there took up my abode.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said I to myself on surveying the place: -</p>

					<p class="f4">Truly a delightful spot,<br />
					with its goodly groves<br />
					and clear flowing river<br />
					with ghats and amenities,<br />
					hard by a village for sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">What more for his striving<br />
					can a young man need<br />
					whose heart is set on striving?</p>

					<p class="f4">So there I sat me down,<br />
					needing nothing further for my striving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Subject in myself to rebirth<br />
					- decay - disease - death - sorrow - and impurity,<br />
					and seeing peril<br />
					in what is subject thereto,<br />
					I sought after the consummate peace of Nirvana,<br />
					which knows neither rebirth nor decay,<br />
					neither disease nor death,<br />
					neither sorrow nor impurity; -<br />
					this I pursued,<br />
					and this I won;<br />
					and there arose within me the conviction,<br />
					the insight,<br />
					that now <a id="pg118"><span class="f2 g"><b>[118]</b></span></a> my Deliverance was assured,<br />
					that this was my last birth,<br />
					nor should I ever be reborn again.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>I have attained, thought I,<br />
					to this Doctrine<br />
					profound,<br />
					recondite,<br />
					hard to comprehend,<br />
					serene,<br />
					excellent,<br />
					beyond dialectic,<br />
					abstruse,<br />
					and only to be perceived by the learned.</p>

					<p class="f4">But mankind delights,<br />
					takes delight,<br />
					and is happy in what it clings on to,<br />
					so that for it,<br />
					being thus minded,<br />
					it is hard to understand casual relations<br />
					and the chain of causation, -<br />
					hard to understand the stilling of all plastic forces,<br />
					or the renunciation of all worldly ties,<br />
					the extirpation of craving,<br />
					passionlessness,<br />
					peace,<br />
					and Nirvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were I to preach the Doctrine,<br />
					and were others not to understand it,<br />
					that would be labour and annoyance to me!</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, and on the instant<br />
					there flashed across my mind these verses,<br />
					which no man had heard before:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Must I now preach what I so hardly won?<br />
							Men sunk in sin and lusts would find it hard<br />
							to plumb this Doctrine, - up stream all the way,<br />
							abstruse, profound, most subtle, hard to grasp.<br />
							Dear lusts will blind them that they shall not see,<br />
							- in densest mists of ignorance befogged.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">As thus I pondered,<br />
					my heart inclined to rest quiet<br />
					and not to preach my Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, Brahma Sahampati's<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> mind<br />
					came to know what thoughts were passing within my mind,<br />
					and he thought to himself: -</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is undone,<br />
					quite undone,<br />
					inasmuch<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> as the heart of the Truth-finder<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					inclines to rest quiet<br />
					and not <a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> to preach his Doctrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his arm<br />
					or might drawback his outstretched arm,<br />
					Brahmā Sahampati vanished from the Brahmā-world<br />
					and appeared before me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Towards me he came with his right shoulder bared,<br />
					and with his clasped hands stretched out to me in reverence,<br />
					saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">May it please the Lord,<br />
					may it please the Blessed One,<br />
					to preach his doctrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">Beings there are<br />
					whose vision is but little dimmed,<br />
					who are perishing because they do not hear the Doctrine; -<br />
					these will understand it!</p>

					<p class="f4">And Brahma Sahampati went on to say:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><i>An unclean Doctrine reigns in Magadha,<br />
							by impure man devised. Ope thou the door<br />
							of Deathless truth. Let all the Doctrine hear<br />
							from his pure lips who first conceived its thought.<br />
							As from a mountains rocky pinnacle<br />
							the folk around are clear to view, so, Sage,<br />
							from thy truth!s palace, from its topmost height,<br />
							survey with eye all-seeing folk beneath,<br />
							- poor thralls of birth and swift decay, whose doom<br />
							is that same sorrow thou no more wilt know.<br />
							So up, great hero, victor in the fight!<br />
							Thy debt is paid. Lead on thy Pilgrim train<br />
							through all the world. Thy Doctrine preach;<br />
							- among thy hearers some will understand.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, Almsmen, heeding Brahmas entreaties<br />
					and moved by compassion for all beings,<br />
					I surveyed the world with the eye of Enlightenment<br />
					and therewith saw beings with vision dimmed little or much,<br />
					beings with acute or dull faculties,<br />
					beings of dispositions good or bad,<br />
					beings docile or indocile,<br />
					with some among <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> them alive to the terrors hereafter,<br />
					of present wrongdoing.</p>

					<p class="f4">As in a pond of lotuses,<br />
					blue or red or white,<br />
					some lotuses of each kind<br />
					are born and grow in the water,<br />
					never rising above the surface<br />
					but flourishing underneath;<br />
					while others, born and growing in the water,<br />
					either rise level with the surface<br />
					or stand right out of the water<br />
					and are not wetted by it; -<br />
					even so with the eye of Enlightenment<br />
					did I see beings with vision dimmed ...<br />
					wrong-doing now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereon, I made answer to Brahma Sahampati in these verses;</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Nirvana!s doors stand open wide to all<br />
							with ears to hear. Discard your outworn creeds!<br />
							The weary task ahead made me forbear<br />
							to preach to men my Doctrines virtues rare.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Mine has it been to secure from the Lord the preaching of the Doctrine!</p>

					<p class="f4">said Brahma Sahampati,<br />
					and, so saying,<br />
					with due obeisance<br />
					and reverently keeping his right side towards me as he passed,<br />
					he vanished there and then.</p>

					<p class="f4">I now asked myself<br />
					to whom first I should preach the Doctrine,<br />
					and who would understand it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought came to me<br />
					that there was Āḷāra Kālāma,<br />
					who was learned, able, and intelligent,<br />
					whose vision had long been but little dimmed;<br />
					suppose I chose him to be my first hearer,<br />
					for he would be quick to understand?</p>

					<p class="f4">Word, however, was brought to me by deities<br />
					that he had died seven days before,<br />
					and insight assured me this was so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Great nobility, thought I, was his!</p>

					<p class="f4">Had he heard my Doctrine,<br />
					he would have understood it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again I asked myself<br />
					to whom first I should preach the Doctrine,<br />
					and who would understand it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought came to me<br />
					that there was Uddaka Rāmaputta, who was learned ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Word, however, was brought me by deities<br />
					that he had died yesterday at midnight,<br />
					and insight ... understood it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Again I asked myself<br />
					to whom first I should preach the Doctrine<br />
					and who would understand it quickly.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought came to me<br />
					that there were the five <a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> Almsmen<br />
					who had served me so well<br />
					in my struggles to purge myself of self;<br />
					suppose I chose them to be my first hearers?</p>

					<p class="f4">Wondering where they were dwelling now,<br />
					I saw with the Eye Celestial -<br />
					which is pure<br />
					and far surpasses the human eye -<br />
					those Five Almsmen<br />
					dwelling at Benares<br />
					in the Isipatana deer-park.</p>

					<p class="f4">So, when I had stayed as long as pleased me at Uruvela,<br />
					I set out on an alms-pilgrimage for Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4">On the highway from the Bo-tree to Gaya,<br />
					Upaka the Mendicant <i>(ājīvika)</i> saw me and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverend sir, your faculties are under control,<br />
					and your complexion is clear and bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">To follow whom<br />
					have you gone forth on pilgrimage?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or who is your teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4">Or whose Doctrine do you profess?</p>

					<p class="f4">Him I answered in these verses:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>All-vanquishing, all-knowing, lo! am I,<br />
							from all wrong thinking wholly purged and free.<br />
							All things discarded' cravings rooted out,<br />
							- whom should I follow? - I have found out all.<br />
							No teacher's mine, no equal. Counterpart<br />
							to me there's none throughout the whole wide world.<br />
							The Arahat am I, teacher supreme,<br />
							utter Enlightenment is mine alone;<br />
							unfever'd calm is mine, Nirvāna's peace.<br />
							I seek the Kāsis' city, there to start<br />
							my Doctrine's wheel, a world purblind to save,<br />
							sounding the tocsin's call to Deathlessness.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">According to your claim, sir, said Upaka,<br />
					you should be the Universal Conqueror.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>Like me, those conquer who the Cankers quell;<br />
							- by conquering bad thoughts, I'm Conqueror.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">When I had thus answered, Upaka<br />
					the Mendicant said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Mebbe,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>	sir,<br />
					and, shaking his head,<br />
					took a different road<br />
					and went his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the course of my alms-pilgrimage,<br />
					I came at last <a id="pg122"><span class="f2 g"><b>[122]</b></span></a> to Benares<br />
					and the Deer Park of Isipatana,<br />
					in which were the Five Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">From afar the five saw me coming<br />
					and agreed among themselves as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">Here come the recluse Gotama,<br />
					the man of surfeits,<br />
					who has abandoned the struggle<br />
					and reverted to surfeiting.</p>

					<p class="f4">We must not welcome him,<br />
					nor rise to receive him,<br />
					nor relieve him of bowl and robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet let us put out a seat;<br />
					he can sit on it if he wants to.</p>

					<p class="f4">But, as I drew nearer and nearer,<br />
					those Five Almsmen proved less and less able<br />
					to abide by their compact; -<br />
					some came forward to relieve me of my bowl and robes;<br />
					others indicated my seat;<br />
					while others brought water<br />
					for me to wash my feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">But they addressed me by my name<br />
					and by the style of reverend.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I said to the Five Almsmen: Almsmen,<br />
					do not address the Truth-finder by his name<br />
					or by the style of reverend.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arahat all enlightened is the Truth-finder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken to me, Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Deathless has been won;<br />
					I teach it;<br />
					I preach the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Live up to what I enjoin,<br />
					and in no long time<br />
					you will come - of yourselves,<br />
					here and now -<br />
					to discern and realize,<br />
					to enter on and to abide in,<br />
					that supreme goal of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which young men go forth<br />
					from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Said the Five Almsmen: -<br />
					Reverend Gotama,<br />
					the life you led,<br />
					the path you trod,<br />
					and the austerities you practised, -<br />
					all failed to make you transcend ordinary human scope<br />
					and rise to special heights<br />
					of discernment of the truly Noble Knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">How now shall you rise to those heights<br />
					when you surfeit,<br />
					abandon the struggle,<br />
					and revert to surfeiting?</p>

					<p class="f4">To which I made answer:</p>

					<p class="f4">Arahat all enlightened is the Truth-finder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken to me, Almsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Deathless has been won;<br />
					I teach it;<br />
					I preach the Doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">Live up to what I enjoin,<br />
					and in no long time you will come -<br />
					of yourselves, here and now -<br />
					to discern and realize,<br />
					to enter on and to abide in,<br />
					that supreme goal of the higher life,<br />
					for the sake of which young men go forth<br />
					from home to homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time did the Five Brethren<br />
					repeat their <a id="pg123"><span class="f2 g"><b>[123]</b></span></a> words to me;<br />
					and a second time did I return them the same answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when they repeated their words yet a third time,<br />
					I asked these Five<br />
					whether they agreed<br />
					that I had never heretofore spoken like that;<br />
					and they admitted that I had not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arahat all enlightened -<br />
					repeated I -<br />
					is the Truth-finder.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearken ... homelessness on Pilgrimage.</p>

					<p class="f4">I succeeded in convincing the Five.</p>

					<p class="f4">I instructed two of their number,<br />
					while the three others went abroad for alms;<br />
					and what those three brought back from their round,<br />
					maintained all six of us.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, I instructed three,<br />
					while two went abroad for alms;<br />
					and what those two brought back from their round,<br />
					maintained all six of us.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the course of receiving<br />
					this teaching and instruction from me,<br />
					those Five Almsmen -<br />
					being themselves subject to rebirth,<br />
					decay,<br />
					disease,<br />
					death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					and impurity -<br />
					saw peril in what is thereto subject,<br />
					and so sought after the consummate peace of Nirvana,<br />
					which knows neither rebirth nor decay,<br />
					neither disease nor death,<br />
					neither sorrow nor impurity;<br />
					and there arose within them<br />
					the conviction,<br />
					the insight,<br />
					that their Deliverance was now assured,<br />
					that this was their last birth,<br />
					nor would they ever be reborn again.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fivefold are the pleasures of sense, Almsmen,<br />
					namely,<br />
					visible shapes apparent to the eye,<br />
					sounds apparent to the ear,<br />
					odours apparent to the nostrils,<br />
					tastes apparent to the tongue,<br />
					touch apparent to the body; -<br />
					all of them pleasant,<br />
					agreeable,<br />
					and delightful,<br />
					all of them bound up with passion and lusts.</p>

					<p class="f4">All recluses or brahmins<br />
					who partake of these pleasures<br />
					with avid greed<br />
					and blind appetite,<br />
					without seeing the perils which dog them<br />
					and without realizing that they afford no refuge, -<br />
					all such people are to be conceived of<br />
					as having fallen into misery<br />
					and into calamity,<br />
					and as being at the mercy of the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a deer of the forest<br />
					in the toils of the baited trap it has found,<br />
					would be conceived of<br />
					as having fallen into misery<br />
					and into calamity,<br />
					as being at the trapper's mercy,<br />
					and as being unable to escape at will<br />
					when the <a id="pg124"><span class="f2 g"><b>[124]</b></span></a> trapper comes, -<br />
					even so are all recluses or brahmins<br />
					who ... mercy of the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">But all those other recluses or brahmins<br />
					who partake of the fivefold pleasures of sense<br />
					without avid greed and blind appetite,<br />
					but with discernment of the perils which dog them<br />
					and with a realization that these things afford no refuge, -<br />
					all these are to be conceived of<br />
					as not having fallen into misery<br />
					or into calamity<br />
					and as not being at the mercy of the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a deer of the forest<br />
					which is not in the toils of the baited trap it has found,<br />
					would be conceived of<br />
					as having fallen into no misery or calamity,<br />
					and as not being at the trapper's mercy,<br />
					but as being able to escape at will<br />
					when the trapper comes; -<br />
					even so all these other recluses or brahmins<br />
					who ... and as not being at the mercy of the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even as a deer of the forest<br />
					roaming the forests fastnesses<br />
					is confident and secure<br />
					as it walks or stands,<br />
					reclines or slumbers, -<br />
					because the trapper cannot get to it,<br />
					even so, divested of pleasures of sense,<br />
					divested of wrong states of mind,<br />
					an Almsman enters on<br />
					and abides in<br />
					the First Ecstasy,<br />
					with all its zest and satisfaction, -<br />
					a state bred of inward aloofness<br />
					but not divorced from observation and reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked Māra ...<br />
					(etc., as at <a href="mn.025.chlm.sbb.htm#pg111">pp. 111-3 of Sutta 25</a>) ...<br />
					the Cankers become eradicated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such an Almsman is said to have hoodwinked Māra<br />
					and to have put Māra's eyes out of gear,<br />
					so as to have passed out of range of vision of the Evil One<br />
					and to have passed<br />
					- here and now -<br />
					beyond desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is confident and secure<br />
					as he walks or stands,<br />
					sits or slumbers, -<br />
					because the Evil One cannot get to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, those Almsmen rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>

The austerities of our <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">12th Sutta</a> presumably preceded his study under Āḷāra Kālāma and Uddaka Rāmaputta; but they may be the austerities practised at Uruvelā with the Five Brethren (see infra, <a href="#pg122">p. 122</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Here the <i>Vinaya</i> (I, 4, translated at <i>S.B.E.</i> XIII, 84) and the <i>Dīgha Nikāya</i> (<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.14.pali.bd.htm#pg36">II, 36,</a> translated at <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.14.rhyt.pts.htm#pg29"><i>Dialogues</i> II, 29</a>) have versions practically identical with this. All agree, as do later compilations like the Introduction to the <i>Jātakas,</i> in recording the initial reluctance of Gotama to preach his new gospel to others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The <i>Dīgha</i> speaks merely of one of the Great Brahmās, - the specific reference to Sahampati being regarded as a later gloss by Rhys Davids (Dialogues II, 70) [?], though there is no justification for assigning seniority here to the <i>Dīgha</i> over the <i>Majjhima</i> and <i>Vinaya</i> versions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This, the first use of the term Tathāgata in the Buddha's life-history, follows immediately on his attaining Buddhahood and is designedly put into the mouth of Mahā-Brahmā himself, the supreme deity of the superseded cosmology.</p>
