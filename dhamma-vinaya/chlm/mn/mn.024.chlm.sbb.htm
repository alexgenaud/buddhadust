					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo grove where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					there came to the Lord<br />
					many Almsmen of the locality<br />
					who had been passing the rainy season there;<br />
					and these, after due obeisance,<br />
					seated themselves to one side,<br />
					and were thus addressed by the Lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">Who among the Almsmen from hereabouts<br />
					is by his fellows in the higher life<br />
					who come also from here,<br />
					esteemed - as wanting little himself<br />
					and as urging Almsmen too to want but little;<br />
					as being contented in himself<br />
					and also preaching contentment to Almsmen;<br />
					as living aloof in the inner life himself<br />
					and also preaching it to Almsmen;<br />
					as eschewing mundane society<br />
					and also urging Almsmen to eschew it;<br />
					as being strenuous himself<br />
					and also inciting Almsmen to be strenuous;<br />
					as leading a virtuous life himself<br />
					and also inciting Almsmen to virtue;<br />
					as having won rapt concentration for himself<br />
					and also exhorting Almsmen thereto;<br />
					as having won wisdom for himself<br />
					and also exhorting Almsmen thereto;<br />
					as having found Deliverance for himself<br />
					and also encouraging Almsmen thereto;<br />
					as having himself attained to the full Vision of Deliverance<br />
					and also urging Almsmen thereto;<br />
					as one who exhorts,<br />
					informs,<br />
					instructs,<br />
					enlightens,<br />
					cheers onward,<br />
					and helps forward<br />
					his fellows on the higher life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa, sir, was the answer;<br />
					the venerable Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta; -<br />
					he is esteemed as being all this<br />
					by his fellows in the higher life<br />
					who come, like him, from round here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, at that time,<br />
					near the Lord there was sitting the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					to whom the thought came how <a id="pg0"><span class="f2 g"><b>[104]</b></span></a> great a thing,<br />
					how very great a thing,<br />
					it was for the reverend Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta<br />
					that, in the presence of the Master,<br />
					his well-informed fellows in the higher life<br />
					should thus extol him,<br />
					point after point,<br />
					and that the Master should so appreciate him;<br />
					it would be good to meet Puṇṇa somewhere<br />
					some day<br />
					and have a talk with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Lord had stayed at Rājagaha as long as he wished to,<br />
					he set out on an alms-pilgrimage for Sāvatthī and,<br />
					arriving there in due course,<br />
					stayed in Jeta's grove in Anāthapiṇḍika's pleasaunce.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing of the Lord's movements,<br />
					Puṇṇa packed away his bedding,<br />
					took his bowl and robes,<br />
					and set out on an alms-pilgrimage for Sāvatthī,<br />
					and in the pleasaunce found the Lord,<br />
					by whom he seated himself after due obeisance.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sat there,<br />
					the Lord discoursed to him on the Doctrine,<br />
					informing,<br />
					enlightening,<br />
					cheering him forward<br />
					and helping him onwards,<br />
					after which Puṇṇa,<br />
					rejoicing greatly in what he had heard from the Lord,<br />
					rose up and with deep obeisance<br />
					withdrew to Andha grove,<br />
					there to stay during the noontide heat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, an Almsman went and told Sāriputta<br />
					that Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta,<br />
					of whom he was always speaking so highly,<br />
					had just left the Lord<br />
					after a heartening discourse on the Doctrine<br />
					and was off to Andha grove<br />
					there to stay during the noontide heat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Snatching up his mat hurriedly,<br />
					Sāriputta followed Puṇṇa up closely from behind,<br />
					never letting him get out of sight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering the grove,<br />
					Puṇṇa sat down under a tree for the noontide;<br />
					and Sāriputta found a tree for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">When at even Sāriputta rose up from his meditations,<br />
					he moved towards Puṇṇa<br />
					and after exchange of greetings<br />
					took his seat to one side, saying -</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you, reverend sir,<br />
					lead the higher life with our Lord?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, reverend sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this in order to purify your life?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it to purify your heart?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it to purify your views?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it to ensure purity by dispelling doubts?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it to ensure purity<br />
					by fullest insight into paths right and wrong?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it to ensure by fullest insight<br />
					<a id="pg105"><span class="f2 g"><b>[105]</b></span></a> into the way by which to walk?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is it for then,<br />
					as you answer no to all these questions?</p>

					<p class="f4">To attain absolute Nirvana, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is that purity of life?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it purity of heart?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it purity of view?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it the purity which comes from dispelling doubts?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it the purity which comes from fullest insight into paths right and wrong?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it the purity which comes from fullest insight into the way by which to walk?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Is it the purity which insight gives?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Does absolute Nirvana lack these states of mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">No, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">As you answer no to all these questions,<br />
					pray how is the meaning of your words to be understood?</p>

					<p class="f4">If, sir, the Lord were to explain absolute Nirvana as purity of life<br />
					or as any other of the purities you name,<br />
					then he would make it contingent<br />
					and not absolute;<br />
					and if absolute Nirvana simply meant the lack of those states of mind,<br />
					then the ordinary man would have Nirvana, -<br />
					for, he has none of those states of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consequently, sir, I will give you an illustration; -<br />
					by an illustration some men of understanding<br />
					apprehend the meaning of a statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is just as if,<br />
					while King Pasenadi of Kosala was in residence here in Sāvatthī,<br />
					some emergency were to arise in Sāketa<br />
					and his people were to arrange seven carriages for him<br />
					in relays along the road<br />
					between Sāvatthī and Sāketa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose now the King were to get into the first carriage at the palace door<br />
					and to drive along in it till he came to the second carriage,<br />
					and were then to dismiss the first<br />
					and get into the second carriage,<br />
					and so on until the seventh carriage<br />
					brought him to the door of his palace in Sāketa;<br />
					and suppose within the palace<br />
					he were asked by his entourage and kinsfolk<br />
					whether it was in that last relay<br />
					he had come from Sāvatthī to the door of his palace in Sāketa, -<br />
					what would be the correct answer for his majesty to give?</p>

					<p class="f4">His correct answer would be that,<br />
					on an emergency requiring him to leave for Sāketa,<br />
					his people arranged seven carriages<br />
					in relays for him along the road;<br />
					that <a id="pg106"><span class="f2 g"><b>[106]</b></span></a> at the door of his palace in Sāvatthī<br />
					he got into the first carriage,<br />
					in which he drove along till he came to the second carriage into which he changed,<br />
					and so on till at last the seventh carriage brought him to the door of his palace in Sāketa.</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way, sir,<br />
					purity of life takes a man as far as purity of heart<br />
					and no further;<br />
					purity of heart takes him only up to purity of views;<br />
					and so on till fullest insight<br />
					carries him on to absolute Nirvana, -<br />
					for which it is that I lead the higher life with the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hereupon, the reverend Sāriputta said to the reverend Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta:</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your reverence's name,<br />
					and how are you known<br />
					to your fellows in the higher life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Puṇṇa, reverend sir;<br />
					is my name;<br />
					and as Mantāṇi-putta (son of the brahmin lady, Mantāṇī)<br />
					am I known to my fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">How like a well-instructed disciple<br />
					who understands the Master's teaching to the full,<br />
					has the reverend Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta answered,<br />
					point by point,<br />
					questions deep and profound!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					that his fellows in the higher life<br />
					have the reverend Puṇṇa<br />
					to see and to consort with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it would be a great thing for them,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					to see and to consort with him,<br />
					even if they had to carry him about<br />
					upon a cushion on their heads.</p>

					<p class="f4">A great thing too,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					is it for me<br />
					that it has been mine<br />
					to see and to consort with the reverend Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon, the reverend Puṇṇa Mantāṇi-putta said to the reverend Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">W'hat is your reverence's name,<br />
					and how are you known<br />
					to your fellows in the higher life?</p>

					<p class="f4">Upatissa, reverend sir, is my name;<br />
					and as Sāriputta (son of the brahmin lady Sāri)<br />
					am I known<br />
					to my fellows in the higher life.</p>

					<p class="f4">And here have I been talking,<br />
					without knowing it was Sāriputta,<br />
					to the disciple whom men liken to the <a id="pg107"><span class="f2 g"><b>[107]</b></span></a> Master himself!</p>

					<p class="f4">Had I but known it was Sāriputta,<br />
					I should certainly not have presumed<br />
					to answer him at such length.</p>

					<p class="f4">Wonderful, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Marvellous, sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">How like a well-instructed disciple<br />
					who understands the Master's teaching to the full,<br />
					has the reverend Sāriputta,<br />
					point by point,<br />
					put questions deep and profound!</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a great thing,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					that his fellows in the higher life<br />
					have the reverend Sāriputta<br />
					to see and consort with.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, it would be a great thing for them,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					to see and to consort with him,<br />
					even if they had to carry him about<br />
					on a cushion on their heads.</p>

					<p class="f4">A great thing too,<br />
					a very great thing,<br />
					is it for me<br />
					that it has been mine<br />
					to see and to consort with the reverend Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such wise did each of that noble pair of Arahats<br />
					<i>(mahā-nāga)</i> applaud what the other had said so well.</p>
