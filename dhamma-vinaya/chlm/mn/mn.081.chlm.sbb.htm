					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord<br />
					with a large train of Almsmen<br />
					was on an alms-pilgrimage in Kosala,<br />
					he turned off the road<br />
					and at a certain spot smiled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the reverend Ānanda: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the cause,<br />
					what are the reasons<br />
					for the Lord's smiling;<br />
					for, Truth-finders never smile<br />
					without cause and reason.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So, with one shoulder respectfully bared<br />
					and with folded palms reverently extended towards <a id="pg24"><span class="f2 g"><b>[24]</b></span></a> the Lord,<br />
					Ānanda asked what made him smile,<br />
					seeing that Truth-finaers never smile<br />
					without cause and reason.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In bygone times, Ānanda,<br />
					a market-town stood here, named Vehalinga,<br />
					opulent and wealthy,<br />
					populous and thronged with folk;<br />
					and hard by<br />
					lived Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just here was his pleasaunce;<br />
					and on this very spot<br />
					he sat preaching to is Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Spreading out his robe folded in four,<br />
					Ānanda said: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I beg the Lord to seat himself here,<br />
					and then this spot will have been frequented<br />
					by two Arahats all-enlightened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seating himself accordingly,<br />
					the Lord addressedĀnanda as follows: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					lived near the market-town of Vehalinga,<br />
					and on this very spot he sat <a id="pt46" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg46"><span class="f2">[46]</span></a> preaching to his Confraternity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the town there was a potter named Ghaṭīkara<br />
					who ministered, more than anyone,<br />
					to Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened;<br />
					and Ghaṭīkara had<br />
					as his bosom-friend<br />
					a young brahmin named Jotipāla,<br />
					whom he wanted to take to see<br />
					Kassapa the Lord, Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					as he much valued going there himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A truce to this,<br />
					my dear Ghaṭīkara,<br />
					was the answer;<br />
					what is the good of seeing that shaveling of a recluse?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A second time<br />
					and yet a third time<br />
					did Ghaṭīkara renew his appeal,<br />
					but only to get the same answer.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he then invited Jotipāla<br />
					to come with him to the river to bathe,<br />
					taking with them their strings of red bath-balls<br />
					to shampoo themselves with.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Jotipāla readily assenting,<br />
					down the two went to the river to bathe,<br />
					and here Ghaṭīkara,<br />
					after mentioning that the Lord Kassapa's pleasaunce was hard by,<br />
					renewed his appeal to Jotipāla,<br />
					<a id="pt47" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg47"><span class="f2">[47]</span></a> repeating it thrice<br />
					and thrice receiving the same refusal as before.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, he made his appeal again,<br />
					this time with a grip on Jotipāla's girdle;<br />
					but Jotipāla shook his girdle free<br />
					and again refused to come.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At last, Ghaṭīkara seized Jotipāla -<br />
					whose hair was down after bathing -<br />
					by the hair of his head<br />
					and made a final appeal to him to <a id="pg25"><span class="f2 g"><b>[25]</b></span></a> come.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thought the young brahmin: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is wonderful indeed and marvellous that this potter,<br />
					my inferior in birth,<br />
					should be impelled to seize me by the hair;<br />
					methinks this presages great things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he said to the potter: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To this length do you go,<br />
					friend Ghaṭīkara?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes, to this length, friend Jotipāla,<br />
					so highly <a id="pt48" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg48"><span class="f2">[48]</span></a> do I value<br />
					going to see Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let go then, and we will start now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So to Kassapa the Lord the two went.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On arrival, the potter<br />
					after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side,<br />
					as also did the young brahmin<br />
					after exchange of civil greetings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ghaṭīkara then presented his friend the young brahmin Jotipāla,<br />
					with the request that the Lord would instruct him in the Doctrine.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon, by a discourse on the Doctrine,<br />
					the Lord Kassapa instructed,<br />
					roused,<br />
					fired,<br />
					and cheered them onwards, -<br />
					after which the two thanked him with glad hearts,<br />
					rose up,<br />
					and took their leave with deep reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said Jotipāla to Ghaṭīkara: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Hearing this Doctrine,<br />
					are you not for becoming a Pilgrim?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do you not know,<br />
					my dear Jotipāla,<br />
					that I have aged,<br />
					blind parents to support?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Well, then, I will go from home to homelessness as a Pilgrim.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So back the two went to Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					<a id="pt49" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg49"><span class="f2">[49]</span></a> to whom,<br />
					when after salutations they were both seated,<br />
					Ghaṭīkara presented his friend for admission to the Order;<br />
					and Jotipāla was admitted and confirmed<br />
					of the following of Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Soon -<br />
					about a fortnight after Jotipālas confirmation -<br />
					the Lord Kassapa,<br />
					having stayed as long as he wanted at Vehalinga,<br />
					proceeded on his tour towards Benares,<br />
					where he resided in the Sages' grove in the deer-park.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When it reached the ears of Kikī,<br />
					king of Kāsi,<br />
					that the Lord Kassapa had arrived there,<br />
					he ordered his chariots so fair, so fair,<br />
					to be got ready<br />
					and in one of these<br />
					drove in procession out of Benares<br />
					in royal state<br />
					to visit the Lord Kassapa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After riding in his chariot<br />
					as far as the ground permitted,<br />
					and then con- <a id="pg26"><span class="f2 g"><b>[26]</b></span></a> tinuing his way on foot,<br />
					the king came to the Lord,<br />
					whom he first saluted<br />
					and then took a seat to one side,<br />
					there to be instructed,<br />
					roused,<br />
					fired<br />
					and cheered onwards<br />
					by a discourse from the Lord Kassapa.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The instruction over,<br />
					the king invited the Lord,<br />
					<a id="pt50" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg50"><span class="f2">[50]</span></a> with the Confraternity,<br />
					to take his meal with him on the morrow.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By silence the Lord gave assent,<br />
					whereon the king rose<br />
					and withdrew with deep reverence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When night was gone,<br />
					the king ordered an excellent meal in his palace<br />
					of food, both hard and soft,<br />
					made of specially dried golden-rice without speck,<br />
					and divers sauces and curries therewith.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he ordered announcement to be made to Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					that all was ready;<br />
					and in the forenoon,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					the Lord came to the palace<br />
					and sat down on the seat set for him,<br />
					with his Confraternity round him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thereupon, with his own royal hands<br />
					the king served that excellent meal to the Confraternity<br />
					with the Buddha at its head, -<br />
					without stint,<br />
					till all had had their fill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Lord's meal over,<br />
					the king took a low seat to one side<br />
					and invited the Lord to spend the rainy season at Benares,<br />
					where the Confraternity would be ministered to<br />
					as they had been that day.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Stay, sire;<br />
					I have already promised to be elsewhere for the rains.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After repeating his invitation<br />
					a second and yet a third time,<br />
					and still being met by the same answer,<br />
					the king <a id="pt51" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg51"><span class="f2">[51]</span></a>,<br />
					upset and pained by this refusal,<br />
					asked the Lord whether there was anyone<br />
					who ministered more than himself.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yes sire;	at Vehalinga there is a potter named Ghaṭīkara<br />
					who in his ministrations<br />
					surpasses all others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your Majesty was upset<br />
					and pained by my refusal; -<br />
					not so Ghaṭīkara<br />
					either now or any future time.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has found his refuge in the Buddha,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and the Confraternity;<br />
					he slays not;<br />
					he steals not;<br />
					no sensual misconduct is his;<br />
					he lies not;<br />
					he indulges not in arrack or spirits or strong drink;<br />
					perfect faith is his in the Buddha,<br />
					the Doctrine,<br />
					and the Confra- <a id="pg27"><span class="f2 g"><b>[27]</b></span></a> ternity;<br />
					his are the virtues dear to the Noble.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No doubts cloud his beliefs concerning Ill,<br />
					the origin of Ill,<br />
					the cessation of Ill,<br />
					and the course which leads to the cessation of Ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eating only one meal a day,<br />
					he lives the higher life<br />
					in virtue and goodness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He has flung aside<br />
					all jewels and golden ornaments;<br />
					no gold or silver has he.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither with tool nor hand<br />
					does he dig up<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> ground,<br />
					resting content for his material<br />
					with the crumbling soil of a bank<br />
					or with the earth scratched out by rats and dogs.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Of his pots made therewith<br />
					he bids folk take what they like<br />
					in barter for rice or beans or pulse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He supports <a id="pt52" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg52"><span class="f2">[52]</span></a> his blind and aged parents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By destruction of the five bonds<br />
					which tie men to this lower world,<br />
					Ghaṭīkara is destined to translation hereafter<br />
					to realms above,<br />
					never to return thence to this world any more.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Once, sire,<br />
					when I was at Vehalinga,<br />
					I, early in the day,<br />
					duly robed and bowl in hand,<br />
					went to Ghaṭīkara's parents<br />
					and asked where their son was.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your ministrant, said they, is out;<br />
					take the rice from the pot<br />
					and the curry from the dish.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I did so<br />
					and afterwards left.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When Ghaṭīkara returned,<br />
					and asked his parents<br />
					who had gone off with the food,<br />
					and was told that it was Kassapa the Lord,<br />
					Arahat all-enlightened,<br />
					his only thought was how great a thing,<br />
					how very great a thing,<br />
					that the Lord should repose such confidence in him!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And gladness and satisfaction<br />
					lasted on for a fortnight for him,<br />
					and for a week for his parents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Precisely the same thing<br />
					happened another time<br />
					when I had the junket from a pan<br />
					with the curry from the dish</p>
					
					<p class="f4">... <a id="pt58" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg58"><span class="f2">[58]</span></a> week for his parents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Another time,<br />
					when I was at this same Vehalinga,<br />
					my hut let the rain in,<br />
					and I told the Almsmen to go and see<br />
					if there was any thatching material<br />
					at Ghaṭīkara's dwelling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">No, was their answer;<br />
					there is only the thatch on his own roof.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then go and strip it off, said I;<br />
					and they did so.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The parents asked who was stripping their thatch off<br />
					<a id="pg28"><span class="f2 g"><b>[28]</b></span></a> and received the answer<br />
					that the hut of the Lord Kassapa<br />
					was letting the rain in.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Take it, sirs, said they;<br />
					take it, dear people.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the potter returned<br />
					and on enquiry was told of all this,<br />
					his only thought was how great</p>
					
					<p class="f4">... <a id="pt54" href="../../pali/mn/mn.077.pali.bd.htm#pg54"><span class="f2">[54]</span></a> week for his parents.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For three whole months<br />
					the dwelling stood bare to the heavens,<br />
					and yet not a drop of rain came through! -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such, sire, is Ghaṭīkara the potter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Said the king: -</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is a great thing, sir,<br />
					a very great thing indeed,<br />
					for this potter to have such confidence<br />
					reposed in him by the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, Ānanda,<br />
					Kikī, king of Kāsi,<br />
					ordered five hundred cartloads<br />
					of the choicest golden-rice,<br />
					with curry-stuffs to match,<br />
					to be despatched to the potter,<br />
					to whom the king's servants came<br />
					with the royal present<br />
					for acceptance accordingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The king, was his response,<br />
					has much to do and look after;<br />
					I have nothing to do with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But, if you were to imagine, Ānanda,<br />
					that the young brahmin,<br />
					Jotipāla, of those days<br />
					was someone else,<br />
					that would be erroneous; -<br />
					it was I myself who was Jotipāla then.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Glad at heart,<br />
					the reverend Ānanda rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
