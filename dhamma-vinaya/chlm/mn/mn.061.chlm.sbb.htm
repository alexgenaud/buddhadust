					<p class="f4">Once when the Lord was staying at <a href="../../../backmatter/appendixes/buddhas_india/buddhas_india.htm#rajagaha">Rājagaha</a><br />
					in the Bamboo-grove<br />
					where the squirrels were fed,<br />
					and the reverend Rāhula was staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā,<br />
					the Lord, arising towards eventide from his meditations,<br />
					went over to Rāhula,<br />
					who, seeing the Lord some way off,<br />
					set a seat for him <a id="pg298"><span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span></a> and water to wash his feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seating himself on the seat set for him,<br />
					the Lord poured water over his feet,<br />
					while Rāhula after salutations<br />
					took his seat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having still a minute drain of water in the water-jar,<br />
					the Lord said to Rāhula:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you see this minute drain of water?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Minute, likewise, is the recluse-ship<br />
					of those who shrink not from deliberate lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then throwing away the water,<br />
					the Lord said to Rāhula:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you see this minute drain of water<br />
					now thrown away?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thrown away, likewise, is the recluse-ship<br />
					of those who shrink not from deliberate lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Upsetting the jar,<br />
					the Lord said to Rāhula:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you see this jar upset?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Upset, likewise, is the recluse-ship<br />
					of those who shrink not from deliberate lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">Setting the jar upright again,<br />
					the Lord said to Rāhula:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you see this jar empty and void?</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Empty and void, likewise, is the recluse-ship<br />
					of those who shrink not from deliberate lying.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is like, Rāhula, a kings elephant<br />
					with tusks as long as the pole of a plough,<br />
					a vast beast of noble lineage,<br />
					which has seen many battles<br />
					and, when it comes into battle,<br />
					goes to work with its fore feet<br />
					and its hind feet,<br />
					with its fore-quarters<br />
					and its hind-quarters,<br />
					with its head<br />
					and its ears<br />
					and its tail, -<br />
					but <a id="pt415" href="../../pali/mn/mn.061.pali.bd.htm#pg415"><span class="f2">[415]</span></a> keeps-its trunk out of danger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Noting this, the mahout feels the elephant's life is not lost.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the elephant goes to work with its trunk too,<br />
					then the mahout feels the elephant's life is lost,<br />
					for it has left undone<br />
					nothing it could do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just in the same way, Rāhula,<br />
					he who does not shrink from deliberate lying<br />
					has not - say I - left undone<br />
					any evil thing which he could do.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, you must school yourself<br />
					never to lie<br />
					even in jest.</p>

					<p class="f4">What think you, Rapula?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is a mirror for?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> To reflect, sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">In just the same way<br />
					you must reflect again and again<br />
					in doing every act,<br />
					in speaking every word<br />
					and in thinking every thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you want to do anything,<br />
					you must reflect whether it would conduce<br />
					to your or others' harm<br />
					or to both,<br />
					and so is a wrong act,<br />
					productive of woe<br />
					and ripening unto woe.</p>

					<p class="f4">If reflection tells you<br />
					this is the nature of that contemplated fact,<br />
					assuredly you should not do it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt416" href="../../pali/mn/mn.061.pali.bd.htm#pg416"><span class="f2">[416]</span></a> But if reflection assures you<br />
					there is not harm but good in it,<br />
					then you may do it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If while you are doing that act,<br />
					reflection tells you<br />
					it is harmful to you or to others<br />
					or to both<br />
					and is a wrong act<br />
					productive of woe<br />
					and ripening unto woe,<br />
					abandon it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if reflection assures you<br />
					there is not harm but good in it,<br />
					then you may go forward with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If when you have done that act,<br />
					reflection assures you<br />
					that it has conduced to your or others' harm<br />
					or to both<br />
					and is a wrong act<br />
					productive of woe<br />
					and ripening unto woe,<br />
					then you should declare<br />
					and disclose<br />
					and unfold it<br />
					to your master<br />
					or to the discreet among your fellows in the higher life,<br />
					and you should henceforth develop self-control.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt417" href="../../pali/mn/mn.061.pali.bd.htm#pg417"><span class="f2">[417]</span></a> But if reflection assures you<br />
					there is not harm but good in it,<br />
					then joy and gladness shall be yours<br />
					as you school yourself by day and by night<br />
					in the things that are right.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the same holds good for speech<br />
					and <a id="pt418" href="../../pali/mn/mn.061.pali.bd.htm#pg418"><span class="f2">[418-9]</span></a> for thoughts also.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pt420" href="../../pali/mn/mn.061.pali.bd.htm#pg420"><span class="f2">[420]</span></a> All recluses and brahmins, Rāhula,<br />
					who in past ages were pure in deed, word and thought,<br />
					won that purity by constant reflection.</p>

					<p class="f4">So in ages to come<br />
					will their successors win their purity,<br />
					even as it is won by recluses and brahmins to-day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, school yourselves<br />
					by constant reflection<br />
					to win purity in deed, word and thought.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Glad at heart, the reverend Rāhula rejoiced in what the Lord had said.</p>
