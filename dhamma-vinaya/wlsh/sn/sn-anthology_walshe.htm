					<h4><a id='preface'>Preface</a></h4>
					
					<p class="f4">Unlike the anthology of the Aṇguttara Nikāya in this series by the Ven. Nyānaponika, this selection from the Saṃyutta is by three different hands: <a href="../../../resources/pdf/sn-anthology/ireland-sn-anthology-1.pdf">Part I</a> by John D. Ireland, <a href="../../../resources/pdf/sn-anthology/nyananada-sn-anthology-2.pdf">Part II</a> by the Ven. ñāṇananda, and Part III by the undersigned. Since the choice of each translator ranged over the entire Nikāya, the three parts do not present the whole material in canonical order. Accordingly an index has been provided showing all extracts in that order. A certain lack of terminological consistency was another unavoidable disadvantage, though this is in practice probably not very serious. It should further be noted that the Anthology does not include three important items' — the Buddha's first three sermons' — since these have already appeared in No. 17 of the Wheel series. With one small exception, too, the important Vedana Saṃyutta (SN 36) is not represented, because a separate translation of it has meanwhile been published WH 303-304).</p>
					
					<p class="f4"><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm#SN">The full translation</a> of the Saṃyutta Nikāya published by the Pali Text Society runs to five volumes, the first two by Mrs C.A.F Rhys Davids (who edited the whole), and the last three by F.L. Woodward. In the preface to Vol. I Mrs Rhys Davids wrote: "It has been more than once suggested that a volume of selections would be of more instant service than would be afforded by the long drawn out appearance of the whole work in its original order ... it will be for a later generation to exercise private judgment in compiling eclectic extracts." And indeed anyone familiar with that translation, or with the original will, be likely to agree that a version drastically pruned of much repetitive material is desirable. This selection may be regarded as a contribution towards such a version, which is to be wished for not only in the interests of concision, but because, despite the eminence and the devotion of the original translators, their version has many shortcomings. A certain number of actual mistakes have here been corrected by all three translators, but also many stylistic changes have been deemed necessary. The prose (and the verse!) of the earlier version is often intolerably stilted, sometimes to a point where it is almost unreadable, indeed, scarcely perhaps intelligible, to some present-day readers. Another difference is that whereas the PTS version was intended for a limited, fairly scholarly and largely non-Buddhist public, the present rendering will doubtless be used mainly by practicing Buddhists all over the world, to many of whom English is not their mother tongue but the language of international discourse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It may safely be claimed that, by presenting their version in good modern English, free from archaic frills, the translators will have succeeded in bringing the message of the Buddha, as found in this Saṃyutta, closer to the reader. It is also safe to say that many will be surprised and delighted at the wealth that it contains, by its vivid similes and occasional humor. Thus in the present volume the reader will find the delightful story of the female deva who tried to tempt a young and handsome bhikkhu, and of how the Buddha dealt with the situation; of how the Buddha persuaded King Pasenadi not to over-eat; we hear how Nanda, the Buddha's cousin, paraded before the Teacher with well-pressed robes and painted eyes; of how the Buddha coped with angry Brahmans and how the Ven. Udāyī taught a Brahman lady to show proper respect for the Sangha; from the Ven. Khemaka we even learn something of what it feels like to be an <i>anāgāmin</i>. There is comfort and hope, too, for those who may feel their human weaknesses debar them from progress, and besides mindfulness we are reminded of the value of faith (not of course blind faith, but a reasoned confidence in the Teacher).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Saṃyutta Nikāya deserves to be better known among Western Buddhists than it appears to be, and it is to be hoped that this anthology will help to bring its many treasures to a wider readership.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c">The Doomed</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī, at Jeta Grove, in Anāthapiṇ.dika's park. Now a certain deva,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> as the night was passing away, lighting up the whole Jeta Grove with his effulgent beauty, approached the Blessed One and, having approached, stood on one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Standing thus on one side, the deva spoke this verse before the Blessed One:</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c">Samiddhi</h4>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying at Rājagaha in the Tapodā Park. Now the Venerable Samiddhi, as dawn approached, arose and went to the Hot Springs<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> to bathe. Having bathed, he came out of the Hot Springs and stood, clad in a single garment, drying his limbs. Then a certain she-deva,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> as the night was passing away, lighting up the entire Hot Springs lake with her effulgent beauty, approached the Venerable Samiddhi and, hovering in the air, addressed him thus in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having had no sport, monk seeing alms,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span><br /> 
					Having none today, just seeking alms,<br />
					Why not get your fill, monk, then seek alms,<br />
					Lest your fleeting hour should slip away?<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">[Samiddhi replied:]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Hour" you say, but I know not the hour.<br />
					Hidden is my hour, and not revealed:<br />
					Therefore, self-restrained, I just seek alms,<br />
					Lest my fleeting hour should slip away.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the she-deva came down to earth and said to Samiddhi: "You are young, bhikkhu, to have left the world, black-haired, with the bloom of youth. In your youthful prime you do not enjoy the pleasures of the senses. Get your fill, bhikkhu, of human pleasures. Don't reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring."<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, do not reject the present moment to pursue what time will bring. I reject what time will bring to pursue the present moment. Time's pleasures, friend, as the Blessed One has said, are fraught with pain, fraught with tribulation, leading to greater danger. This Dhamma is here-present, out of time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realized by the wise each for himself."<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"In what way, bhikkhu, has the Blessed One said that time's pleasures are fraught with pain, fraught with tribulation and leading to greater danger? In what way is this Dhamma here-present, out of time, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realized by the wise each for himself?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, friend, am fresh, having not long left the world, a newcomer. I am not able to explain in detail this Dhamma and discipline. But the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One is staying at Rājagaha in the Tapodā Park. Go to the Blessed One and ask him about the matter. Then bear in the mind the explanation he gives to you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not easy for us, bhikkhu, to approach the Blessed One. He is surrounded by other devas of great power. If you, bhikkhu, will approach the Blessed One and ask him about the matter, then perhaps we can come to hear the teaching."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend," the Venerable Samiddhi replied to her, and he went to the Blessed One, made his obeisance and sat down to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">[<i>He then told the whole story in identical words to the Buddha.</i>]</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, Lord, that deva was telling the truth, she is right here, not far away."</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had said this, the deva said to the Venerable Samiddhi: "Ask him, bhikkhu, ask him! I've managed to get here!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the deva in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those who go by names, who go by concepts,<br />
					Making their abode in names and concepts,<br />

					<h4 class="ctr c">Dhanañjāni</h4>

					<p class="f4">Thus have I heard. At one time the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> at the Squirrels' Feeding-Place. Now at that time the Brahman lady Dhanañjāni, wife of a certain Brahman of the Bhāradvāja family, was a fervent supporter of the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha. And this lady, while serving the Bhāradvāja Brahman with his dinner, came before him and burst out with this triple inspired utterance: "Praise to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One! Praise to the Dhamma! Praise to the Sangha!"</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Brahman said to her ṇow then, now then! Every chance she gets this wretched woman has to sing the praises of that shaveling recluse! Now, woman, I'm going to tell that teacher of yours what I think of him!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh, Brahman, I know of nobody in this world with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, with its recluses and brahmans, whether they be divine or human, who could thus rebuke the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Fully Self-Enlightened One. But go on, Brahman, go and you will find out."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brahman, angry and displeased, went to see the Blessed One. After exchanging greetings and compliments with the Blessed One in a friendly and courteous manner, he sat down to one side. So seated, he addressed the Blessed One thus in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What must we slay to live in happiness?<br />
					What must we slay if we would weep no more?<br />
					Is there any single thing of which,<br />
					You'd approve the killing, Gotama?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[The Blessed One replied:]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">By slaying wrath you'll live in happiness<br />
					Slaying wrath, you'll no more need to weep.<br />
					Kill the poisoned root of anger, Brahman,<br />
					Which with sweetness leads to fevered rage.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Killing this the Noble Ones commend:<br />
					Slaying this, you'll no more need to weep.</p>

					<p class="f4">At these words the Brahman said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, good Gotama,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> most excellent! It is, good Gotama, as if someone were to set up something that had been knocked down, or to reveal what had been hidden, or to point out the right path to a man who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place so that those with eyes could see what was there' — just so has the good Gotama shown me the truth<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span> in various ways! I declare<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> that I go to the Lord Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha of monks, I wish to embrace the homeless life<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span> under the Lord Gotama, I wish to receive ordination."<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">So the Bhāradvāja Brahman was received into the homeless life under the Blessed One, and received ordination. And not so long after his ordination the Venerable Bhāradvāja, remaining alone and secluded, heedful, ardent and resolute, quickly attained that for which young men of good birth rightly go forth from home into the homeless life, coming to realize for himself, in this present life, the unsurpassed goal of the holy life, realizing that "birth is destroyed, the holy life has been accomplished, what was to be done is done! There is no further life in this world."<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span></p>

At these words the Blessed One said: "What do you think, brahman? Do you receive visits from friends and colleagues, blood-relations and others?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, good Gotama, sometimes such people come."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think? Do you serve them with solid food, soft food and savories?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, good Gotama, sometimes."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But supposing, brahman, they do not accept what you offer, whose is it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If they do not accept, good Gotama, then it belongs to us."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is here, brahman. The abuse, the scolding, the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile, we do not accept from you. It all belongs to you, brahman, it all belongs to you! If a man replies to abuse with abuse, to scolding with scolding, to reviling with reviling, brahman, that is like you joining your guests for dinner. But we are not joining you for dinner. It is all yours, brahman, it is all yours!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The king and his court believe that Gotama the recluse is an Arahant. And yet the good Gotama can get angry!"<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">[The Blessed One said in verse:]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could anger rise in him who's free,<br />
					Wrathless, all his passions tamed, at peace,<br />
					Freed by highest insight, by himself,<br />
					So abiding, perfectly serene?<br />
					If a man's abused and answers back,<br />
					Of the two he shows himself the worse.<br />
					He who does not answer back in kind,<br />
					Celebrates a double victory.<br />
					From his action both sides benefit,<br />

[<i>Returning he went to the Blessed One and said:</i>] "It would be well, Lord, if the Blessed One were to visit the dwelling of Sangārava the Brahman, out of compassion for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One silently consented. [<i>Having visited him, the Blessed One said:</i>] "Is it true, brahman, that you are a 'purity-by-water' man ... that you go down to the water every evening and morning?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, good Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What benefit do you expect from [<i>this practice</i>]?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is like this, good Gotama. The evil deeds that I do in the day I cause to be borne away in the evening, and the evil deeds that I do in the night I cause to be borne away in the morning. That is the benefit I expect from [<i>this practice.</i>]"</p>

					<p class="f4">[<i>The same is repeated for</i> 'without taking care']</p>

[<i>As before but after each thought</i>: 'and he arouses ardor']' — this, friend, is arousing ardor. [<i>The same repeated with:</i> 'taking care'].

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, if some monk is overwhelmed with gains, favors and fame so that his head is turned, so, having risen early and taken his robe and bowl and gone for alms to the village or market town, he eats his fill, gets invited again for next day, and has a full bowl.

Thus this bhikkhu, who is so overwhelmed with gains, favors and fame that his head is turned, despises other well-behaved bhikkhus. But this will bring harm and sorrow to that wretched man for many a long day. That shows you, monks, how disastrous gains, favors and fame are, what a bitter, harsh impediment to the attainment of the unsurpassed freedom from bondage.

					<p class="f4">"Here, monks, the uninstructed worldling ... regards body as the self, the self as having body, body as being in the self, or the self as being in the body.

					<h4 class="ctr c">Going Begging: A Stern Admonition (<i>part</i>)</h4>

					<p class="f4">"This, monks, is the meanest<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn148" href="#n148">148</a>]</sup></span> of callings' — that of one who goes begging! It is a term of abuse in the world to say: 'You scrap-gatherer, wandering about bowl in hand!' This is the life undertaken by young men of good family seeking their own good because it is good, not compelled by rulers, not compelled by robbers, not on account of debts, not through fear, not for a livelihood,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn149" href="#n149">149</a>]</sup></span> but with the thought: 'Here I am, plunged into birth, decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair, thrown into suffering, overcome with suffering! Surely there must be a way of bringing this entire mass of suffering to an end!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, monks, a young man of good family leaves the world, but he is greedy for sense pleasures, with fierce passions, with hate in his heart, corruptly motivated,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn150" href="#n150">150</a>]</sup></span> lacking in mindfulness, inattentive, unconcentrated, scatter-brained, his faculties uncontrolled.

There are, monks, three unskilled ways of thought: thoughts of lust, thoughts of ill-will, thoughts of hurting.

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, monks, this concentration on the signless is greatly to be commended; the concentration on the signless, if developed and frequently practiced, is of great fruit, of great profit.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, monks, these two views: the existence view and the non-existence view. And the well-taught Ariyan disciple deliberates: 'Is there anything in the world that I can cling to without being at fault?' And he realizes: 'There is nothing in the world that I can cling to without being at fault. Suppose I were to grasp and cling to the body, ... to feelings, ... perceptions, ... the mental formations, ... consciousness. Conditioned by my clinging, becoming would arise; conditioned by becoming, birth; conditioned by birth; decay-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair.

					<p class="f4">"I have made this parable, Tissa, to help you to understand. This is the explanation.

Sometimes when a man thinks, 'I will regard this as repulsive,' he comes to think of it as attractive. Is there any other cause, any other reason whereby those young monks ... can practice the holy life ... to the end of their days?"</p>

Is mind the fetter of thoughts,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn218" href="#n218">218</a>]</sup></span> or are thoughts, the fetter of mind?"</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c">Things Productive of Suffering (<i>extracts</i>)<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn223" href="#n223">223</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when a monk knows as they really are both the arising and the destruction of states productive of suffering, then indeed the sense-pleasures are truly seen by him. When he sees the sense-pleasures, the desire and love for sense-pleasures, the infatuation and feverish longing for sense-pleasures that is inherent in them, all this does not obsess him. His life and practice<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn224" href="#n224">224</a>]</sup></span> are so informed with wisdom<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn225" href="#n225">225</a>]</sup></span> that, living thus, he is not assailed by longing and depression,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn226" href="#n226">226</a>]</sup></span> which are evil and unskilled states.</p>

					<p class="f4"> ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, monks, a monk lives and practices like this, it occasionally happens that, through a lapse of mindfulness, evil and unskilled states arise, memories and thoughts<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn227" href="#n227">227</a>]</sup></span> pertaining to the fetters. His mindfulness is aroused only slowly,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn228" href="#n228">228</a>]</sup></span> but then he soon abandons that state, drives it out, abolishes it, puts an end to it. Just as if, monks, a man were to let fall two or three drops of water into an iron pot that had been heated all day, those few drops would soon be wiped out and vanish' — in the same way it occasionally happens to a monk living and practicing like this ... but he soon puts an end to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, if a monk's life and practice are so informed with wisdom that, living thus, he is not assailed by longing and depression, which are evil states, then, monks, if a king's ministers, friends, favorites, kinsmen or blood-relations should come and offer him wealth, saying: 'Come, good master! Why let these yellow robes torment you? Why go around with shaven head and bowl? Come on, return to the lower life, enjoy possessions and do works of merit!'' — monks, for a monk so living and practicing to reject the training and revert to the lower life would just be impossible."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, when a monk fully comprehends as they really are the arising and passing away of the five groups of clinging,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn231" href="#n231">231</a>]</sup></span> to that extent his vision becomes fully purified."</p>

					<p class="f4">But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer, and he went to another monk ...</p>

					<p class="f4">But that monk was dissatisfied with the other's answer, and he went to the Blessed One ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monk, a man had never seen a 'what's it' tree. So he went to someone who had seen one,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn234" href="#n234">234</a>]</sup></span> and said: 'Tell me, good sir, what does a "what's it" tree look like?'

'Well now, a "what's it" tree is sort of reddish, like a lump of meat.' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer, so he went to another man ... 'Well now, a "what's it" tree is stripped of its bark, with burst pods, rather like an acacia.' But that man was not long satisfied with this answer, so he went to another man ... 'Well now, a "what's it" tree has very thick leaves. It gives close shade like a banyan.' So for a while he sees the 'what's it' tree as that man sees it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monk, according to the way the vision of these wise monks<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn235" href="#n235">235</a>]</sup></span> has become purified, so they explain it, each according to his disposition.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, monk, just like some king's border-city, with strong walls and arches, and with six gates.

Then the two messengers take a truthful report to the lord of the city, and return the way they came. [<i>Likewise from the west, south, north.</i>]</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have given you a parable, monk, and so that you can understand it, this is the explanation: 'The city' is a name for the body, composed of the four great elements, born of mother and father, an accumulation of rice and gruel, impermanent, subject to abrasion, dissolution and disintegration. 'The six gates' denote the six internal sense-spheres.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn236" href="#n236">236</a>]</sup></span> 'The gatekeeper' denotes mindfulness.

'The cross-roads at the center' denotes the four great elements: the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element. 'The truthful report' denotes Nibbāna.

Having tethered them with a stout rope, he fastens the ropes together in the middle, he lets them go. Now, monks, these six animals of different domains and feeding habits would swing around struggle, each trying to get to his natural domain. The snake would struggle, thinking 'I'll get to the ant-hill'; the crocodile: 'I'll get into the water'; the bird: 'I'll fly up in the air'' the dog: 'I'll make for the village'; the jackal: 'I'll make for the charnel-ground'; the monkey: 'I'll head for the forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, monks, when those six hungry animals grew weary, they would yield to the one that was the strongest, go his way and be under his power. In the same way, monks, whenever a monk fails to practice and develop mindfulness as to body, the eye struggles to draw him towards attractive objects, while unattractive objects are repellent to him ... The mind struggles to draw him towards attractive objects of thought, while unattractive objects of thought are repellent to him. This, monks, is lack of restraint. Ant what, monks, is restraint? In this, a monk, seeing objects with the eye, is not drawn to attractive objects, is not repelled by unattractive objects. He remains with firmly established mindfulness as to body, his mind being unrestricted.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn241" href="#n241">241</a>]</sup></span> He knows in truth that liberation of the heart, that liberation by wisdom,<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn242" href="#n242">242</a>]</sup></span> through which those evil, unskilled states that have arisen pass away without remainder ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man catches six animals (<i>as before</i>), and he fastens the rope together to a stout post or pillar ... Then, when those six animals grow weary, they would have to stand, crouch or lie down by the stout post or pillar.

This, monks, is restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Tethered to a stout post or pillar,' monks, denotes mindfulness as to body. Therefore, monks, this is how you must train yourselves: 'We shall practice mindfulness as to body, develop it, make it our vehicle, our dwelling-place our resort, we will build it up and undertake it thoroughly.'

					<h4 class="ctr c">The Siṃsapā Leaves<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn313" href="#n313">313</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<p class="f4">At one time the Blessed One was staying at Kosambi in Siṃsapā Grove. Then the Blessed One, taking a few Siṃsapā leaves in his hand, said to the monks: "What do you think, monks? Which are the more numerous, the few leaves I have here in my hand, or those up in the trees of the grove?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the Blessed One is holding only a few leaves: those up in the trees are far more numerous."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, there are many more things that I have found out, but not revealed to you.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn314" href="#n314">314</a>]</sup></span> What I have revealed to you is only a little. And why, monks, have I not revealed it?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, monks, it is not related to the goal, it is not fundamental to the holy life, does not conduce to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquillity, higher knowledge, enlightenment or Nibbāna. That is why I have not revealed it. And what, monks, have I revealed?</p>

					<p class="f4">"What I have revealed is: 'This is Suffering, this is the Arising of Suffering, this is the Cessation of Suffering, and this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering.' And why, monks, have I revealed it?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because this is related to the goal, fundamental to the holy life, conduces to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquillity, higher knowledge, enlightenment and Nibbāna, therefore I have revealed it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, monks, your task is to learn: 'This is Suffering, this is the Arising of Suffering, this is the Cessation of Suffering, this is the Path that leads to the Cessation of Suffering.' That is your task."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> These words are repeated from the beginning of the whole work (SN 1.1), translated in Vol. I and Vol. II with slight differences. I render <i>Bhagavā</i> literally as "the Blessed One" (Vol. I: "the Lord," Vol. II with KS "the Exalted One"). For the meaning of <i>deva</i> (or <i>devatā</i>) see Vol. I, n.1. In general, information given in the notes to Vols. I and II will not be repeated here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Buddha here makes a vital distinction which is valid to this day as marking the difference between the aims of "popular Buddhism" and the serious treading of the Path. "Merit" (<i>puñña</i>) can lead to a happier rebirth, perhaps in one of the <i>deva</i>-worlds, but this too will come to an end. The proper course is to tread the Noble Eightfold Path and gain the "final peace" of Nibbāna. Note, however, the remarks of the Ven. Khantipalo in <i>The Buddhist Monk's Discipline</i> (WH 130/131, p.7): "<i>Puñña</i> is the benefit of increasing purity of mind derived from skillful actions such as generosity, virtue, helpfulness, etc. 'Merit' is an inadequate rendering."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Mānakāma:</i> "conceit and lust."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Citta:</i> "mind," but often like the metaphorical use of "heart" in English.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> He will pass "beyond death" to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Cf. <i>Bhagavadgītā</i> ī, 58: "He who withdraws his senses on all sides from sense-objects as the tortoise draws in his limbs, is firmly established in wisdom." The same image occurs in SN 35.199 (not included in this Anthology).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This is the meaning of Tapodā. Cf. place-names such as Teplā, Teplice in Czecho-Slovakia, all associated with hot springs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Strictly speaking, "she-deva" is ungrammatical, since deva (<a href="#n1">n.1</a>) is masculine (the fem. <i>devī</i> usually means "queen." In all of these little stories the Pali text has the abstract noun <i>devatā</i> which, like our "deity," covers both sexes. It is clear from the context as well as the pronouns used later in some (but not all) manuscripts that this one is female. In its anglicized form, "deva" can perhaps legitimately be taken to denote either sex.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> In Pali there is an untranslatable play here on the two meanings of <i>bhutvā,</i> "having eaten," and "having enjoyed oneself." Such puns and similar ambiguities are not infrequent in the texts, and are often difficult to bring out in translation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> As will be seen, the devas, (none of whom, of course, are enlightened) are at various stages of spiritual development. This one is clearly not very advanced!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The hour Samiddhi means is that of his death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Kālika:</i> "concerned with time" ("time-ish": Mrs. Rhys Davids). The deva probably means "there is time for all that as you are young," but the word is no doubt introduced together with <i>sandiṭṭhika</i> (here rendered "the present moment") to enable Samiddhi to quote the standard formula on the Dhamma (<a href="#n13">n. 13</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Sandiṭṭhiko akāliko ehipassiko opanayiko paccataṃ veditabbo viññuuhi. Sandiṭṭhiko</i> lit means "visible" but has the sense of "present, at the present time, in this life"; <i>akāliko</i> "timeless" can mean both "immediate" and ṇot involving time, outside of time," <i>ehi-passiko</i> = "come-and-see-ish"; <i>opanayiko</i> (from <i>upa-neti</i> "leads towards") means "leading to the goal." The Dhamma as Truth can only be realized individually by insight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Mrs Rhys Davids says "The Buddha rebukes the fairy [see below, <a href="#n16">n. 16</a>] for her suggestive ambiguities." But the real ambiguity lies deeper than such frivolity, being concerned with the difference between conventional truth (<i>sammuti-sacca</i>) which takes beings, etc., as being real, and the ultimate truth (<i>paramattha-sacca</i>) which does not (see also <a href="#p5">&sect; 5</a>, <i>The Arahant</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Sace vijānāsi</i>: Mrs. Rhys Davids renders "If thou knowest [such a man]." But the clear meaning is "if you can grasp this distinction," which is how the she-deva takes it, admitting that she cannot.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> "Fairy": <i>yakkhī,</i> a female <i>yakkha</i>. These (Sanskrit <i>yak.sa</i>) are somewhat ambiguous creatures, sometimes helpful, sometimes harmful to man, though later they are thought of as demons (see PED). There is doubtless an implied rebuke in the Buddha's choice of this form of address. "Fairy" (also an ambivalent expression) is probably the best word here (as used by Mrs. Rhys Davids).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The three forms of conceit (<i>māna</i>) are to think one is equal to, less than, or better than another. All three are due to the ego-illusion (see <a href="#p30">&sect; 30</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Nāma-ruupa.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> He has passed into Nibbāna, and therefore cannot be found anywhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> She has, according to SA, rightly discerned the Middle Way between self-indulgence and self-torture. In fact, it looks as if her understanding is still somewhat limited: she has, however, grasped the fact that she was indulging in wrong speech at the ethical, if not the ontological level referred to by the Buddha, and she has also understood that one should "leave desires." If she has been cured of her frivolity, that at least is a good start!</p>

Used in everyday speech this word most often simply means "myself, yourself," etc. with absolutely no "metaphysical" implications' — a point frequently overlooked by those who wish at all costs to prove that Buddhism teaches the existence of some kind of "self."

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> <i>Tittha</i> "ford" also means "bathing-place." There is an intentional play on both meanings of the word here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> <i>Sakyamuni</i>. The designation is found here only in the superscription, and is rare in the Pali Canon (Childers in his dictionary deprecates its use in Western writings), though later frequently used in Mahāyāna writings to distinguish the Buddha Gotama (Sanskrit <i>Gautama</i>) from other Buddhas there referred to. Here too, other Buddhas have just been mentioned (see <a href="#n50">n. 50</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Preceding sections have told the same story about Gotama's predecessors, the Buddhas Vipassī, Sikhī, Vessabhu, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamma, and Kassapa. All those who attain Buddhahood are assumed to undergo the same basic experiences, at immense intervals of time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> This term, in Theravāda Buddhism, is applied to one who is on his way to becoming a Buddha, thus normally to Gotama before his enlightenment (but also to the previous Buddhas mentioned in <a href="#n50">n. 50</a>, before their enlightenment). The more famous Sanskrit term <i>Bodhi-sattva</i> means literally "Enlightenment-Being." It may however be a false Sanskritization for <i>Bodhi-sakta</i> (which would also be <i>Bodhi-satta</i> in Pali) "one who is attached to or desires to gain Enlightenment." See relevant article in EB, and Har Dayal, <i>The Bodhisattva Doctrine in Buddhist Sanskrit Literature</i>, London 1932. For an instance of Mahāyāna influence on the Theravāda commentarial tradition see also Bhikkhu Bodhi, <i>The All-Embracing Net of Views</i> (BPS 1978), pp. 49f, 254-330.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> <i>Yoniso manasikārā</i>: a frequent expression. <i>Yoni</i> (lit. "womb") means "source, foundation," etc. The modern idiom might be "investigation in depth."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> <i>Samma Diṭṭhi</i>: the first step of the Noble Eightfold Path, lit. "Right Seeing." It is also rendered "Right Understanding," but the connotations of this are too exclusively intellectual. The rendering "Right Views" (plural) is to be rejected, since it is not a matter of holding "views" (opinions) but of "seeing things as they really are."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> <i>Atthitā:</i> "is-ness." The theory of "Eternalism" (<i>sassatavāda</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> <i>Natthitā</i>: "is-not-ness." The theory of "Annihilationism" (<i>ucchedavāda</i>). All forms of materialism come under this heading. See the discussion in Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation of DN 1, <i>The All-Embracing Net of Views</i> (cf. n. 51, pp. 30-33.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> I take this to mean the man who sees "with the highest wisdom" mentioned above. Mrs Rhys Davids seems to have gone slightly astray here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Cf. <a href="#n32">n. 32</a>. Feer's edition of SN reads here <i>attā na me ti</i> "this is not myself," which would also make sense but is contradicted, not only in SA, but also when the story is repeated at īI, 90.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> The usual translation "suffering," always a makeshift, is inappropriate here<br />
					<i>Dukkha</i> in Buddhist usage refers to the inherent unsatisfactoriness and general insecurity of all conditioned existence.</p>
				
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> <i>Sabbam atthi</i>. From the Sanskrit form of this expression, <i>sarvam asti</i> (though used in a slightly different sense) the Sarvāstivādin school got their name. They held that <i>dharmas</i> existed in "three times," past, present and future. It was mainly to this early school that the label "Hīnayāna" ("Lesser Career <i>or</i> Vehicle") was applied and later illegitimately applied to the Theravāda (see <a href="#n77">n. 77</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Lit. probably either "Thus come" <i>tathā-āgata</i> or "Thus gone (beyond)" (<i>tathā-gata</i>): the Buddha's usual way of referring to himself. For other meanings cf. <i>The All-Embracing Net of Views</i> (n. 51), pp. 50-53, pp. 331-344.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> <i>Nibbidā</i>: sometimes rendered "revulsion," but this suffers from the defect of suggesting too strong an <i>emotional</i> reaction. "Disenchantment" covers it better.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> <i>Virāga</i> is quite literally "dis-passion." The syntax of this sentence is rather curious, but the meaning is clear enough.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> This gives a clear indication of the minimum standard required for anyone (today, in the West, often a lay person) setting up as a teacher of Buddhism. It denotes a "worldling" (<i>puthujjana</i>, i.e., one who has not "entered the stream") who has the basic intellectual knowledge mentioned here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> This one is a <i>sekha</i> "trainee," i.e., one who has at least "entered the stream" (and thus knows in part from experience), but is not an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> His training is proceeding along the right path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> He is an <i>asekha</i> (ṇon-trainee," i.e., one who has finished his training), an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> Not caused by any conditions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Kassapa here switches from the familiar <i>bho Gotama</i> to the more respectable form. He is now ready to accept instruction.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> <i>Ucchedavāda</i> (<a href="#n59">n. 59</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> <i>Hīnaṃ:</i> This is the adjective used in the term "Hīnayāna," as contrasted with the designation "Mahāyāna," for the developed or expanded Buddhism of the Northern schools. Curiously enough, it is often adopted today by Oriental Theravāda Buddhists themselves, despite the fact that it is both offensive and erroneous. The facts are set out succinctly in E. J. Thomas, <i>History of Buddhist Thought</i> (London 1933), 177f. According to Thomas, <i>yāna</i> in this context means not "vehicle," as usually translated, but "career." Thus Mahāyāna designates the "great career" of the Bodhisattva (cf. <a href="#n51">n. 51</a>) as distinct from the "disciples career" (<i>srāvaka-yāna;</i> Pali <i>sāvaka-yāna</i>) and the career culminating in the status of "solitary Buddha" (<i>Pratyeka-Buddha;</i> Pali <i>Pacceka-Buddha</i>), who is enlightened but does not teach. The word <i>hīnayāna</i> "low or base career" is "a term which has become popularized as the translation of a phrase used by Chinese pilgrims, who seem to have known it as a convenient name for all schools which were not Mahāyāna. But this is not the way the term is used in the Sanskrit texts" (Thomas). It is time the opprobrious term was dropped altogether, and especially with regard to Theravāda, a school almost certainly unknown to those who coined it. It mainly referred to the long-extinct Sarvāstivādins (cf. n 65).</p>
						
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> <i>Maṇ.dapeyyaṃ:</i> lit. "to be drunk like cream."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> A rare case in which the Buddha associates himself with his disciples in order to encourage them. For him, his "leaving the world" has already produced the highest results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> The standard list of "requisites" permitted to a bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> The benefit to himself (<i>attā</i>). Here, as elsewhere, the Buddha does not hesitate to refer to "self" in the relative, conventional sense (cf. <a href="#n32">n. 32</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> <i>Alaṃ ... appamādena sampādetuṃ:</i> cf. the Buddha's last words as given in the <i>Mahāparinibbāna Sutta</i> (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">DN 16</a>). The Rhys Davids translation there (DN 16, vi, 7 [ī, 156]) "Work out your salvation with diligence"; has become altogether too popular.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> This provides one of the two main answers to ignorant suggestions that Buddhism is "selfish": (<i>a</i>) since, in terms of absolute truth (cf. <a href="#n14">n. 14</a>), all things are "self-less" (<i>anattā</i>), there is no real basis for selfishness; and (<i>b</i>), as here, since in the relative sense according to which "selves" can be said to exist, the Dhamma is of benefit both to oneself and to others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> The final part of this very important sutta is translated as No. 19 in Vol. I of this anthology. See now also Bhikkhu Bodhi, <i>Transcendental Dependent Arising</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> <i>āsavā</i> From <i>ā-savati</i> "flows towards" (i.e., either "into" or "out" towards the observer), thus lit. either "influx" or "secretion." The most generally accepted translation today is "cankers." [Another meaning is "fermentation," hence "intoxicants" is a possible alternative rendering.] The four cankers are those of (1) sense-desire (<i>kāmāsava</i>) (2) desire for continued existence (<i>bhavāsava</i>) (3) wrong views (<i>diṭṭhiāsava:</i> cf. <a href="#n57">n. 57</a>): and (4) ignorance (<i>avijjāsava</i>) though (3) is often omitted, being doubtless included in (4). The destruction of the cankers is equivalent to Arahantship, and an Arahant is sometimes called <i>khīnāsava</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> <i>Upanisā:</i> a word of various meanings: "support, cause, means," etc. Formally it looks like the Pali equivalent of <i>upani.sad</i>, but it may be a contraction of <i>upanissaya</i> "decisive support" in the list of the 24 Conditions (see BD, s.v. <i>Paccaya</i>). It is glossed in SA as <i>kāraṇa</i> "cause," <i>paccaya</i> "condition."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> <i>Pīti</i>. A particularly difficult word to translate. Like <i>passadhi</i> "tranquillity," but unlike <i>sukha</i> "happiness," it belongs to a group of mental formations (<i>sankhārakhandha</i>), and ranges from "interest" through "zest" to "rapture." The five degrees of <i>pīti</i> are described in VM IV, 94-99 (in Ven. ñāṇamoli's translation of the text <i>pīti</i> is rendered "happiness" and <i>sukha</i> "bliss").</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> <i>Saddhā</i>. This is not blind faith but confidence in the Buddha and his teaching.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> <i>Dukkha</i> stands here for the usual "decay-and-death" (<i>Jarā-maraṇa</i>) or, in full, "decay, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and despair" (<i>jarā-maraṇa-soka-parideva-dukkha-domanassupāyāsa</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> <i>Jāti</i>. All the rest, down to "ignorance" as in the usual formula of Dependent Origination. See Vol. I, nn. 29-30.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> <i>Tathatta:</i> "the state of thusness," Nibbāna. With a different suffix there is the almost equivalent term <i>tathatā</i>, found mainly in Mahāyāna texts, but also occurring in VM XVī, 6, etc., where it means "the state of being really so."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> <i>Anottāpī:</i> "without moral dread (<i>ottappa</i>)." <i>Ottappa</i> is fear of wrongdoing (and its consequences). It is usually coupled with <i>hiri</i> "moral shame," i.e., fear of doing what one would be ashamed of. These two are known as the "guardians of the world" (<i>Loka-pālā</i>), and together may be regarded as the objective and subjective aspects of what Christians call conscience. Here, <i>anātāpī</i> and <i>anottāpī</i> are linked together by rhyme. If this translation were more concerned with literary effect than with meaning, this could be to a certain extent imitated by a rendering such as "without fire and without care."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> <i>Yogakkhema</i>: <i>Yoga</i> (etymologically related to English <i>yoke</i>), is sometimes used in Buddhism with positive connotations of religious discipline, etc., but more usually has the negative sense as here. Specifically the "yokes" are synonymous with the cankers (<i>āsavā</i>, cf. <a href="#n85">n. 85</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> The meaning (and indeed the form) of this word is doubtful. Feer's text has "<i>Pi.lhika</i> (or <i>Mi.lhaka</i>?)" in the heading, and the word is translated in KS (as here) "dung-beetle." The PED says the reading should be <i>mi.lhakā</i> and renders it "cess-pool," which is obvious nonsense, since a creature of some kind is required. Under <i>pi.lhaka</i> the PED quotes SA as "incorrectly" explaining it by a low insect "breeding in excrements." While "dung-beetle" may conceivably not be entomologically quite correct (a point about which this translator can offer no opinion), there can be no doubt that some such creature is intended, and the PED remarks can only be described as perverse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> <i>ārāma</i>. From the meaning of "pleasure" (<i>ā</i>+<i>ramati</i> "enjoys") this word developed the sense of "pleasure-park" and, after the donation of such parks to the Buddha by Anāthapiṇ.dika and Ambapālī, specifically such a park for the use of bhikkhus. Now also used for a monastery complex.</p>

Pacceka Buddhas (cf. <a href="#n77">n. 77</a>) and disciples (<i>sāvakā</i>). "With no regard..." means not seeing with knowledge (<i>ñānena adassāvī</i>), i.e., seeing them with physical eye but not knowing them for what they are. See <i>The Discourses on the Root of Existence</i> [= MN 1], translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi (BPS 1980), p. 42.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> <i>Sappurisā</i>: MA (as in <a href="#n117">n. 117</a>) says these are Pacceka Buddhas and disciples. Alternatively it is stated that the ṇoble Ones" may refer to Buddhas alone, or that both terms may refer to all the classes</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> <i>Apekhavā ca upādāya ca</i>. KS has "owing to vexation and clinging," but <i>apekhavā</i> = "full of longing or desire" (PED s.v. <i>apekhavant</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> This sutta, as E.J. Thomas (<i>Early Buddhist Scriptures</i>, London 1935, p. 123) says, "has been appealed to both by those who would find in Buddhism the doctrine of something permanent in addition to the five groups [i.e., the <i>sankhāras</i>], and also by those who deny it." To the former party belong, e.g., H.C. Warren, who included it in his <i>Buddhism in Translations</i> (Harvard 1896, rep. 1963), and Erich Frauwallner, who prints in his <i>Philosophie des Buddhismus</i> [East] Berlin 1956, p. 25f. a German translation from the Chinese version of Tsa Ahan (Taisho 99, k. 3) which he entitles "Das Sutra vom Lasttrager" ("The Sutra of the Burden-Bearer") with the Sanskrit heading (retranslated from the Chinese!) <i>Bhārahārasuutram</i>. But Woodward in KS, countering a similar view expressed by A.B. Keith, says: ṇo bearer of the burden is mentioned at all, but a bearing. <i>Hāro</i> is "a taking." <i>The puggalo ["person"] is the taking hold of the fivefold mass</i>." (Woodward's italics). Woodward's view is expressly supported by Mrs Rhys Davids, as editor, in a note of her own, though she doubtless changed her mind about this later, having subsequently (as is well known) drifted into wrong views! The sutta is discussed briefly twice in EB, and, curiously, different opinions are expressed on this point. Under <i>Bhāra</i>, U. K[arunaratana] says: "the burden-bearer (<i>bhārahāra</i>) is the person (<i>puggala</i>)," while under <i>Bhāra Sutta</i> L[akshmi] R. G[oonesekere] writes: "the 'laying hold of the burden' [=<i>bharahara</i>] is the individual." Grammar would seem to be on the side of the latter view, and while I am unable to say whether Frauwallner has translated from the Chinese correctly or not, the same would apply to the Sanskrit title he quotes. It is further noteworthy that in Frauwallner's text the four things are given in a different order from the Pali as: "The Burden," "the taking up of the burden" (but see <a href="#n121">n. 121</a>), "the laying down of the burden," and "the bearer of the burden" [=<i>bhārahāra.</i>] The last of these three is said to be "the person," etc., but with a somewhat expanded description. The final verses are also somewhat different. In any case the Sanskrit text (on which the Chinese version is based) is clearly secondary.</p>
					<p class="f4">It is easy to understand how this sutta could be misunderstood, both in ancient and in modern times, since (doctrinal issues apart!) one would expect the "person" to be described as the bearer rather than the "bearing." The explanation is that the "person" is in terms of relative truth what the <i>khandhas</i> are according to ultimate truth (cf. <a href="#n14">n. 14</a>).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One is tempted to think that this sutta was originally delivered for the benefit of one or other of the Bhāradvājas (see Nos 10, 11, 42), whose name appears to mean "twice-born burden"!</p>
									
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> <i>Bhārādāna</i>: generally translated as "taking up the burden," etc., but <i>ādāna</i>, like <i>upādāna</i>, can also mean "clinging," which gives a more pregnant meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> See Vol. I, n. 49.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> <i>Puggala</i>. A term of relative truth, as pointed out in  <a href="#n120">n. 120</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a>]</sup> <i>Kāmataṇhā:</i> "sensual craving," the first and crudest of three kinds of craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a>]</sup> <i>Bhavataṇhā</i>, the desire for continued existence connected with "Eternalism" (see  <a href="#n58">n. 58</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> <i>Vibhavataṇhā</i>, the desire for non-existence or the "death-wish," connected with "Annihilationism" (see  <a href="#n59">n. 59</a>). In older works sometimes mistranslated as "desire for wealth" (also <i>vibhava</i> but a different word).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> The formula is that for the Second Noble Truth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> The formula is that for the Third Noble Truth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> <i>Sugato</i> lit. "well-gone." All three designations refer, of course, to the Buddha. It is difficult to render the whole phrase into English without awkwardness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> Lit. "he is sated and brought to peace (<i>or</i> 'cooled')."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> <i>Atta-dīpā</i>. <i>Dīpa</i> means both "island" (Sanskrit <i>dvipa</i>) and "lamp" (Sanskrit <i>dīpa</i>), but the meaning "island" is well-established here. The "self" referred to is of course the unmetaphysical pronoun "oneself": cf.  <a href="#n32">n. 32</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> It is necessary to withdraw, to be "an island to unto oneself," at least for a time (as any meditator knows), not for any "selfish" reasons but precisely in order to make this profound introspective investigation. In another sense, Buddhists would of course agree with John Donne that ṇo man is an island."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> As Woodward remarks in KS, one would expect to find here the words which he inserts in the text: "The well-taught Ariyan disciple," as in many passages. If one in fact sees these things and reflects as said in the text, one will cease to be a "worldling."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> <i>Virāga</i>. Elsewhere translated as "dispassion" (<a href="#n68">n. 68</a>), also has this meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> <i>Tadanganibbuto</i> means rather more than Woodward's "one who is rid of all that.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> The too famous "discovery" of Descartes, <i>Cogito, ergo sum</i> ("I think, therefore I am"), comes precisely under this heading. Descartes identified himself with, in Buddhist terms, <i>vicāra</i> "discursive thought," which belongs to the "mental formations" group (<i>sankhārakkhandha</i>). When Goethe (whom many would consider a greater thinker than Descartes) said "Gefuhl ist alles" ("Feeling is everything"), it might be thought that (at that moment) he was identifying himself with the "feeling" group (<i>vedanākhandha</i>). But these are sensations, physical and mental, and what Goethe meant corresponds more probably to <i>pīti</i> (<a href="#n87">n. 87</a>), which also belongs to the mental formations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> <i>Indriya</i>. The standard translation for this word is "faculty" which, though rather vague, is convenient. For the full list of the 22 <i>Indriyas</i>, see BD. These first five are associated with the five (bodily) senses also recognized in the West, to which Buddhism adds mind as the sixth. See also  <a href="#n138">n. 138</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> <i>Avakkanti hoti</i> lit. "there is a descent" (into the womb): they are "born." The meaning is that they exert their influence. The word <i>indriya</i> comes from <i>ind</i>[<i>r</i>]<i>a</i> "lord" (cf. the god Indra) and implies "control": hence they are sometimes referred to as the "controlling faculties."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> <i>Atthi bhikkhave mano</i>. Woodward badly mistranslates this as "Mind is the result," which would render <i>hoti</i> "comes to be," not <i>atthi</i> "is, exists." To say that mind is the "result" of bodily factors is certainly not the Buddhist view and smacks of modern materialistic theories. Mind, even ignorant mind, is not <i>derived</i> from matter. Cf. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/dhp/idx_dhp.htm#ch1">Dhp 1-2</a>: <i>Manopubbanagoma dhamma</i> "Mind precedes all states."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammā</i> (plural). This is one of the regular meanings of this multivalent word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> <i>Avijjadhātu</i>, an unusual combination. Probably in the sense of the (ignorant) <i>manodhātu</i> "mind-element," which "performs the function of Advertence (<i>āvajjana</i>) towards the object of inception of a process of sensuous consciousness" (BD, s. v. <i>dhātu</i>). The reading <i>vijjadhātu</i> "element of knowledge" in Feer's text must, as Woodward recognizes, be wrong here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> <i>Vedayitena</i> "by what is felt." A variant reading is <i>cetasikena</i> "by the mental factor." In the Abhidhamma the <i>cetasikas</i> are the (conventionally 50) "mental formations" comprising the <i>sankhārakkhandha</i> plus the <i>khandhas</i> of feeling (<i>vedanā</i>) and perception (<i>saññā</i>), thus making a total of 52. See BD.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> According to SA, these are the Eternalist and Annihilationist views (nn. 58, 59) respectively: i.e., he believes that he will, or will not, survive after death as a continuing entity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> <i>Ruupī:</i> lit. "having a body." This and the next term refer to the lower and higher <i>jhānas</i> ("absorptions") associated respectively with the "world of form" (<i>or</i> "fine-material world": BD) (<i>ruupaloka</i>) and the "formless world" (<i>or</i> "immaterial world": BD) (<i>aruupaloka</i>), and to the types of rebirth dependent on the attainment of these. See  <a href="#n244">n. 244</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> <i>Nevasaññīnāsaññī</i>, associated with the state of ṇeither-perception-nor-non-perception," the very subtle state of the fourth "formless" (<i>or</i> "immaterial") <i>jhāna</i>. This can still be attained by a "worldling," as was done by Gotama's second teacher, Uddaka Ramaputta, before the Bodhisatta (<a href="#n51">n. 51</a>) decided to "go it alone." Uddaka had thus progressed as far as it is possible to go without "breaking through" to the path of enlightenment.</p>

The rendering "many-folk" favored by earlier translators is literal but not natural English, and also implies a plural. The meaning is one who has not "entered the stream"; cf  <a href="#n176">n. 176</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n156" href="#fn156">156</a>]</sup> <i>Kāmā:</i> "sense-desires." Like the Biblical "lusts of the flesh," it certainly means more than sexual desire, with which it is often exclusively identified, even in the plural form as here.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup> Here, as in other similar passages, SA glosses <i>Tathāgata</i> (<a href="#n66">n. 66</a>) with <i>satta</i> "a being," to the confusion of scholars. The point seems to be that even in this life any "being," and not merely the Tathāgata, is only real in terms of conventional, not of ultimate truth (see  <a href="#n14">n. 14</a>). The difference lies in what happens after death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup> The identification of a person with "consciousness" is strongly condemned by the Buddha's rebuke to "Sāti the fisherman's son" in MN 38.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n161" href="#fn161">161</a>]</sup> Anurādha was of course wrong to say that a Tathāgata can be <i>described</i> otherwise than in one of these four ways, since he cannot after death be described at all. He would have been right to deny that any one of the four ways of description (<a href="#n157">n. 157</a>) was correct, but not to suggest that there is any other possible description. We may note that the "wanderers of another sect" were obviously extremely well informed about the Buddha's teaching (even though they did not really understand it!), and laid a careful trap for Anurādha. They had the terminology off pat, and were only too ready to pounce on a seeming weakness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> "Stirred on his bed" (Woodward). "Tried to get up" ("out of reverence": SA) is the obvious sense.</p>

At this stage, wrong views would have been eliminated, but the other factors would still be residually present. Attention is drawn to this significant passage by the Ven. Dr W.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n197" href="#fn197">197</a>]</sup> <i>Vaṇṇā</i>, lit. "colors." This is the word rendered "caste" in English (from Portuguese <i>casta</i> "breed, race").</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n198" href="#fn198">198</a>]</sup> According to the <i>sekhiya</i> rules of the <i>Pāṭimokkha</i> (cf.  <a href="#n289">n. 289</a>), a monk is not allowed to instruct a person doing any of these three things.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n199" href="#fn199">199</a>]</sup> The text says: "having taken off her shoes ... and bared her head." But presumably she was already barefooted and bareheaded. An example of the standardization of the sutta-text overreaching itself, as occasionally happens.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n200" href="#fn200">200</a>]</sup> The lady now uses the proper respectful term of address.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n201" href="#fn201">201</a>]</sup> It is noteworthy that now, instead of the curt "teach me your doctrine," she asks a highly intelligent question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n202" href="#fn202">202</a>]</sup> Woodward quotes SA as correctly pointing out that "Eye in itself is not old but it has come about by former actions [i.e., <i>kamma.</i>]"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n203" href="#fn203">203</a>]</sup> Cf. the classic definition of kamma at AN 6.63: <i>cetanāhaṃ bhikkhave kammaṃ vadāmi</i> "volition, monks, I declare to be kamma" (see <i>Aṇguttura Nikaya</i>: <i>An Anthology</i> translated by Nyanaponika Thera, Part ī (WH 208-211, p.67).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n204" href="#fn204">204</a>]</sup> <i>Vedanīyaṃ</i>. Hence a basis for craving etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n205" href="#fn205">205</a>]</sup> The same word <i>kamma</i> is used in the Pali.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n206" href="#fn206">206</a>]</sup> This is really the Third Noble Truth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n207" href="#fn207">207</a>]</sup> The word here is <i>kammanta</i>. Right Action is specifically the observance of the first three precepts, i.e., abstaining from killing, theft and sexual misconduct.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n208" href="#fn208">208</a>]</sup> <i>Kammanirodha-gāminī-paṭipadā</i>. The usual term for the Path is <i>dukkhanirodha-gāminī-paṭipadā</i> "the path (<i>or</i> practice) that leads to the extinction of suffering." Here the link between <i>kamma</i> and <i>dukkha</i> is clearly brought out. Those who have attained the goal do not create even good kamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n209" href="#fn209">209</a>]</sup> <i>Pariyāya</i>: a word with several meanings, lit. "going around," hence "succession," "mode," "procedure," etc. This short sutta deals with the very basic question of how, objectively, one can be sure that the declared goal of the Buddha's practice has been achieved: thus the rendering "criterion" is appropriate. It may be compared with the frequently-quoted <i>Kālāma Sutta</i> (AN 3.56: translated in WH 8).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n210" href="#fn210">210</a>]</sup> Not influenced by anybody else.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n211" href="#fn211">211</a>]</sup> <i>Aññaṃ vyākareyya</i>. Woodward's rendering "could affirm insight" is inadequate, because <i>aññā</i> definitely means the highest insight of enlightenment. The declaration takes the form shown below: "Birth is destroyed ... etc."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n212" href="#fn212">212</a>]</sup> The formula is abbreviated in the text here. It is found in full elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n213" href="#fn213">213</a>]</sup> I follow Woodward's rendering for <i>paññāya</i> (lit. "with wisdom"). The actual expression <i>paññācakkhu</i> "eye of wisdom" occurs elsewhere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n214" href="#fn214">214</a>]</sup> The term <i>Brāhmaṇa</i> is used in two different ways in the Pali Canon: (1) to denote a member of the Brahman caste, often depicted rather like the Pharisees in the New Testament; and (2) in the positive sense of one leading a pure life, even an Arahant. Cf. <i>inter alia</i> the Brāhmaṇavagga of the Dhammapada.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n215" href="#fn215">215</a>]</sup> <i>Sagāhaṃ:</i> "(with) sharks": Woodward. <i>Gāha</i> lit. "grabber" is given in the PED as "crocodile": in fact the estuarine crocodile swims far out to sea and so could well be meant here. Another word for "crocodile," <i>suṃsumāra</i>, is used in <a href="#p52">&sect; 52</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n216" href="#fn216">216</a>]</sup> <i>So vedaguu:</i> lit. "he is well-versed in the Vedas," but this word too, like <i>brāhmaṇa</i> (<a href="#n217">n. 217</a>), is often given a different, Buddhist, sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n217" href="#fn217">217</a>]</sup> The word used is <i>saṃyojana</i>, more technically employed for the ten fetters which must be successively broken on the path to enligthenment. The question here concerns the relation between the senses and their objects: which "fetters" which? The answer is: ṇeither."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n218" href="#fn218">218</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammā</i> is here used in one of its specific senses: "mind-objects."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n219" href="#fn219">219</a>]</sup> <i>Chandarāga</i>. <i>Chanda</i> is, as such, an ethically neutral term for "intention," etc. But in combination with <i>rāga</i> "lust, greed," it is definitely unwholesome. It is this state, based on the coexistence of eye and sight-objects, etc, that constitutes the "fetter."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n220" href="#fn220">220</a>]</sup> It is only possible because the eye is <i>not</i> the "fetter" of objects, and so on, that release is possible.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n221" href="#fn221">221</a>]</sup> <i>Na paññāyetha</i> lit. "would not be perceived."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n222" href="#fn222">222</a>]</sup> Woodward goes astray here. He translates: "The bond is the desire and lust which are in things." The whole point, however, is that the desire and lust are in the <i>mind</i>, and not in "things," or there would indeed be no deliverance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n223" href="#fn223">223</a>]</sup> <i>Dukkhadhammā</i>. Woodward's "States of Ill" does not bring out the true meaning sufficiently.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n224" href="#fn224">224</a>]</sup> <i>Cāro ca vihāro ca</i>. Not as Woodward has it, "His path abroad and his lodging at home."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n225" href="#fn225">225</a>]</sup> <i>Anubuddha</i>, past participle of <i>anubodhati</i>, makes good sense. Woodward conjectures <i>anubuddha</i> "followed," and translates "practiced."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n226" href="#fn226">226</a>]</sup> <i>Abhijjhā domanassa</i>: "coveting and dejection": Woodward. It is time to get away from the antiquated "coveting" for <i>abhijjā</i>. Other and more suitable words exist.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n227" href="#fn227">227</a>]</sup> <i>Sāra-sankappā</i>. Memory (<i>sāra</i>) arises first, and then thoughts, plans, etc. (<i>sankappā</i>) take over.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n228" href="#fn228">228</a>]</sup> "At the third attempt he is certain to succeed" (SA).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n229" href="#fn229">229</a>]</sup> <i>Butea Frondosa</i>, a tall tree known as "flame of the forest." The title "Judas Tree" (K.S.) arouses inappropriate associations. The literal meaning of the Pali is "What's It," which is entirely appropriate to the humor of the story of the doubting monk's questionings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n230" href="#fn230">230</a>]</sup> Eye and visible object, ear and sound, etc, the sixth pair being, of course, mind and mind-object (objects of thought).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n231" href="#fn231">231</a>]</sup> The five <i>khandhas</i>: body (<i>ruupa</i>), feeling (<i>vedanā</i>), perception (<i>saññā</i>), the mental formations (<i>sankhārā</i>) and consciousness (<i>viññāṇa</i>). See Vol. I, n. 49.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n232" href="#fn232">232</a>]</sup> The earth-element (<i>paṭhavī-dhātu</i>) or "extension"; the water-element (<i>apo-dhātu</i>) or "cohesion"; the fire-element (<i>tejo-dhātu</i>) or "temperature"; the air-element (<i>vāyo-dhātu</i>) or "motion." These are, of course, not to be confused with "elements" in the modern sense: they are qualities of matter, and all four are present in varying degree in every physical object.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n233" href="#fn233">233</a>]</sup> A frequently recurring formulation of a very basic Buddhist tenet.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n234" href="#fn234">234</a>]</sup> <i>Dassāvī</i>. This word is generally used in the pregnant sense of one "seeing with insight"' — which is of course hinted at here. The descriptions of the tree are as it appears at different seasons.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n235" href="#fn235">235</a>]</sup> <i>Sappurisa</i>, somewhat inadequately rendered "worthies" by Woodward. It is a term of higher (and less ambiguous) praise than that: see  <a href="#n118">n. 118</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n236" href="#fn236">236</a>]</sup> Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body (as organ of touch), mind. The "internal" halves of the six pairs mentioned in  <a href="#n230">n. 230</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n237" href="#fn237">237</a>]</sup> <i>Samatha-vipassanā</i>: the two branches of <i>bhāvanā</i> (generally rendered "meditation" but better called "mind-training"). <i>Samatha</i> "calm, tranquillity" is developed by the practice of the eighth step of the Noble Eightfold Path (<i>sammā-samādhi</i>), and <i>vipassanā</i> "insight" by the seventh (<i>sammā-sati</i>). Both are necessary parts of the Buddhist training, though <i>vipassanā</i> is the practice that leads to the goal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n238" href="#fn238">238</a>]</sup> <i>Goṇa</i>: definitely an ox and not, as Woodward translates, a cow. It is very odd how much confusion exists in English versions of Buddhist scriptures in regard to these well-known bovine creatures: thus we hear of Zen "ox-herding" pictures, whereas it is obvious that the creature to be tamed is no ox but a ferocious bull! See Ven. W. Rahula, <i>Zen and the Taming of the Bull</i>, Bedford 1978, pp. 15ff.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n239" href="#fn239">239</a>]</sup> <i>Kāma-guṇā</i>: sense-pleasures associated with the five external sense objects: visual forms, sounds, scents, tastes and tangibles.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n240" href="#fn240">240</a>]</sup> According to SA, these adjectives refer to the four <i>jhānas</i> (see  <a href="#n244">n. 244</a>). The remainder of this sutta is translated in Vol. 1, No 61.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n241" href="#fn241">241</a>]</sup> <i>Appamāṇa:</i> "boundless."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n242" href="#fn242">242</a>]</sup> <i>Cetovimutti paññāvimutti</i>. Woodward translates too literally "that emancipation of the heart, that emancipation of wisdom," which makes little sense. Arahantship is meant by both terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n243" href="#fn243">243</a>]</sup> <i>Animitto</i>: cf  <a href="#n151">n. 151</a>. Not, as Woodward translates, "The unconditioned," which would be <i>asankhata-Nibbāna</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n244" href="#fn244">244</a>]</sup> There are the four "lower" <i>jhānas</i> ("absorptions") associated with the World of Form (<i>ruupaloka</i>), and the four "higher" <i>jhānas</i> associated with the Formless World (<i>aruupaloka</i>). They are referred to in similar terms in the first eight sections of Samyutta 40 (not included in this Anthology) thus: 1. "With Thought-Conception" (<i>savitakka</i>); 2. "Without Thought-Conception" (<i>avitakka</i>); 3. "By Happiness" (<i>sukhena</i>); 4. "Balanced" (<i>upekkhako</i>); 5. "[Infinity of] Space" (<i>ākāsa</i>); 6. "[Infinity of] Consciousness" (<i>viññāna</i>); 7. ṇothingness" (<i>akiñcañña</i>); 8. ṇeither-perception [nor-non-perception]" (<i>nevasaññī</i>). For further details of these absorptions, which are pre-Buddhist and not essential to the attainment of enlightenment, see BD.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n245" href="#fn245">245</a>]</sup> <i>Nimitta</i>. The characteristic features of anything.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n246" href="#fn246">246</a>]</sup> Woodward translates: "But when I so abode (and had emerged from trance)." His parenthetic addition, here and in the previous eight suttas (not included in this Anthology) is not justified by the text. Moggallāna had not emerged from the absorption (Woodward's "trance"), but his concentration having momentarily weakened, he was lapsing into the state below (i.e., in this case, ṇeither-perception-nor-non-perception").</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n247" href="#fn247">247</a>]</sup> <i>Nimittānusāri-viññāṇaṃ</i>. Woodward's "consciousness that followed after distinguishing marks" is not quite correct. He himself refers to the Commentary on the Sutta Nipāta: "i.e., consciousness that was still tainted with <i>rāga-dosa-moha</i> [lust, hatred and ignorance]."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n248" href="#fn248">248</a>]</sup> <i>Iddhiyā</i>. Woodward's "by magic power" is inappropriate. The meaning is telepathic power, which is neither "magical" nor confined to Buddhas. See BD s.v. <i>Abhiññā</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n249" href="#fn249">249</a>]</sup> "Brahman" here is clearly used in the second of the two senses (<a href="#n214">n. 214</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n250" href="#fn250">250</a>]</sup> <i>Mahā-abhiññatā</i>. Moggallāna has attained to the sixth <i>abhiññā</i>, the only one that is supramundane: the extinction of the cankers (<i>āsavakkhaya</i>) (cf.  <a href="#n85">n. 85</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n251" href="#fn251">251</a>]</sup> A whole Samyutta (SN 41) is devoted to this householder (see also Vol. II, No 23), who is held up as a model layman in SN 17.23 (not translated here). His name is not the same as <i>citta</i> "mind," but means "bright, shining."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n252" href="#fn252">252</a>]</sup> <i>Cakkavatti</i> lit. "a wheel-turning monarch," the Indian term for a universal ruler. This was what Gotama could have become if he had not become a Buddha. The devas are aware of Citta's great virtues (though they possibly exaggerate in thinking he could become a world-ruler!), but are not wise enough to think of his spiritual progress (cf.  <a href="#n10">n. 10</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n256" href="#fn256">256</a>]</sup> As Woodward points out, <i>mayhaṃ</i> "my" is repeated here, "possibly for the sake of framework" (i.e., as a mechanical repetition, as apparently in <a href="#p44">&sect; 44</a>: see  <a href="#n199">n. 199</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n257" href="#fn257">257</a>]</sup> The four "colors" from which the later caste system developed: the <i>khattiyas</i> (Sanskrit <i>ksatriya</i>) or nobles, the group to which Gotama himself belonged; the <i>brāhm.anas</i> or Brahmans, the "priestly" caste (see  <a href="#n214">n. 214</a>); the <i>vessas</i> (Sanskrit <i>vaisya</i>) or merchant class, and the <i>suddas</i> (Sanskrit <i>suudra</i>), the lowest class. For these, the term "serfs" in the text is not entirely appropriate, but it is hard to find an equivalent. See EB s.v. <i>Caste</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n260" href="#fn260">260</a>]</sup> <i>Vossaggapariṇāmi</i>. In a note to SN 3.2.8 (not included in this Anthology), Mrs Rhys Davids quotes SA on this term: "Surrender ... is twofold: the ejection of all lower passions (<i>kilesas</i>) and the forward leap, or <i>elan</i>, to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n261" href="#fn261">261</a>]</sup> <i>Dukkhatā</i>, an abstract noun denoting "suffering" in the most general sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n262" href="#fn262">262</a>]</sup> <i>Dukkha-dukkhatā</i>, the actual feeling of physical or mental pain or anguish.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n263" href="#fn263">263</a>]</sup> <i>Sankhāra-dukkhatā</i>, the suffering produced by all "conditioned phenomena" (i.e., <i>sankhāras</i>, in the most general sense: see BD s.v. <i>sankhāra</i> I, 4). This includes also experiences associated with hedonically neutral feeling. The suffering inherent in the formations has its roots in the imperfectability of all conditioned existence, and in the fact that there cannot be any final satisfaction within the incessant turning of the Wheel of Life. The neutral feeling associated with this type of suffering is especially the indifference of those who do not understand the fact of suffering and are not moved by it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n264" href="#fn264">264</a>]</sup> <i>Viparināma-dukkhatā</i>, the suffering associated with pleasant bodily and mental feelings: "because they are the cause for the arising of pain when they change" (VM XIV, 35).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n265" href="#fn265">265</a>]</sup> <i>Bojjhanga</i> (=<i>bodhi-anga</i>, lit. "limb of enlightenment") or <i>sambojjhanga</i>. The seven <i>bojjhangas</i> are so called (SN 46.5) "because they lead to enlightenment" (<i>bodhi</i>). They are: 1. Mindfulness (<i>sati-sambojjangha</i>), 2. Investigation of (Mental and Physical) States (<i>dhamma-vicaya-s.</i>), 3. Energy (<i>viriya-s.</i>), 4. Rapture (<i>pīti-s.</i>), 5. Tranquillity (<i>passaddhi-s.</i>), 6. Concentration (<i>samādhi-s.</i>), 7. Equanimity (<i>upekkhā-s.</i>). The text makes it clear that of these the first, mindfulness, is the most important, since it is valuable in all circumstances, whereas the others are not always appropriate.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n266" href="#fn266">266</a>]</sup> <i>Pīti</i>: see  <a href="#n87">n. 87</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n267" href="#fn267">267</a>]</sup> <i>Uddhataṃ</i>: not "elated" as translated by Woodward.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n268" href="#fn268">268</a>]</sup> Woodward has here, by an oversight, "is easily raised up." Below, he has correctly "is easily calmed."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n269" href="#fn269">269</a>]</sup> The four <i>Brahma-vihāras</i> ("divine abidings"), also called the four "boundless (<i>appamañña</i>) states," are: 1. Loving-kindness (<i>mettā</i>), 2. Compassion (<i>karuṇā</i>), 3. Sympathetic Joy (<i>muditā</i>), 4. Equanimity (<i>upekkhā</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n270" href="#fn270">270</a>]</sup> <i>Upekha</i>, the adjective from <i>upekkhā</i>. "Equanimous" is a rare word in modern English, but is less misleading than "indifferent." It is used by the Ven. ñanamoli in PP.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n271" href="#fn271">271</a>]</sup> <i>Sato sampajāno</i>. The old rendering (introduced by T. W. Rhys Davids) "mindful and self-possessed" dies hard, but is far too vague, if not positively misleading. The real meaning of <i>sampajāna</i> is "clearly aware": see BD s v. <i>sampajañña</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n272" href="#fn272">272</a>]</sup> <i>Subha</i>. This is explained in MN 77 as being associated with the fourth (lower) <i>jhāna</i> (<a href="#n244">n. 244</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n273" href="#fn273">273</a>]</sup> Cf. VM IX, 76: "If unable to reach higher than the attainment of loving-kindness and attain Arahantship, then when he falls from this life, he reappears in the Brahma world as one who wakes up from sleep."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n274" href="#fn274">274</a>]</sup> <i>Paṭigha</i> (here) "resistance" (as of solid objects). Another meaning of this word is "resentment."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n275" href="#fn275">275</a>]</sup> The first of the higher (formless) <i>jhānas</i> (<a href="#n244">n. 244</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n276" href="#fn276">276</a>]</sup> The second of the higher (formless) <i>jhānas</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n277" href="#fn277">277</a>]</sup> Equanimity (<i>upekkhā</i>) as an enlightenment-factor (<a href="#n265">n. 265</a>) is here distinguished from equanimity as a <i>Brahma-vihāra</i> (<a href="#n269">n. 269</a>). The difference lies in the mode of attainment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n278" href="#fn278">278</a>]</sup> The third of the higher (formless) <i>jhānas</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n279" href="#fn279">279</a>]</sup> <i>Mantā:</i> "mantras" or, presumably, sacred texts of the Brahmans.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n280" href="#fn280">280</a>]</sup> <i>Kāye kāyānupassī</i>. Woodward translates: "dwells in body contemplating body (as transient)" (the bracketed words are Woodward's own-unnecessary addition) and similarly, e.g., I. B. Horner in her rendering of the <i>Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta</i> (MLS 10) has: "contemplating the body in the body." These and other similar renderings are perhaps unnecessarily literal versions of the Pali-idiom. But cf. Commentary on the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta: "Why is the word body used twice? For the sake of an unmixed determination (of the object of meditation). He (the meditator) does not contemplate the feelings, etc, in (regard to) the body, but just the body."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n281" href="#fn281">281</a>]</sup> <i>Sampajāno</i>. Cf.  <a href="#n271">n. 271</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n282" href="#fn282">282</a>]</sup> <i>Abhijjhādomanassa</i>. Woodward's "the dejection in the world which arises from coveting" is another possible rendering (but see <a href="#p49">&sect; 49</a>,  <a href="#n228">n. 228</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n283" href="#fn283">283</a>]</sup> <i>Pasādaniye</i>. Woodward has "pleasurable" which is dangerously ambiguous, even though in a note he quotes SA as saying "such as the Buddha." The meaning is "that which inspires (faith, etc.)."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n284" href="#fn284">284</a>]</sup> <i>Vitakka-vicāra</i> "initial and sustained thought," As rendered in the next sentence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n285" href="#fn285">285</a>]</sup> These are the four standard objects of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n286" href="#fn286">286</a>]</sup> <i>Paṇidhāya</i>. The difference between the two kinds of meditation is that between concentration on an object (<i>samādhi</i>) and "choiceless awareness," which is <i>sati</i>. See  <a href="#n237">n. 237</a>. For a full account of this practice, see Nyanaponika Thera, <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i>, London 1962.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n287" href="#fn287">287</a>]</sup> Such as the object previously envisaged. SA says <i>kammatthāna</i> "the meditation object."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n288" href="#fn288">288</a>]</sup> Woodward considers that "before" means the practice, and "after" means its goal, i.e., Nibbāna. More probably it means keeping his mind in the present moment, dwelling neither on the past nor on the future.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n289" href="#fn289">289</a>]</sup> <i>Pāṭimokkha</i>, the monastic code of conduct, now enshrined in the 227 rules which are recited fortnightly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n290" href="#fn290">290</a>]</sup> <i>Acāra-gocara-sampanno</i>, i.e., "having perfected the training up to the stage you have reached."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n291" href="#fn291">291</a>]</sup> Reading with Woodward <i>sikkhāhi</i> "train yourself" (imperative) instead of Feer's <i>sikkhasi</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n292" href="#fn292">292</a>]</sup> <i>Sīla:</i> "disciplined behavior."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n293" href="#fn293">293</a>]</sup> These are, of course, the five senses recognized in the West, to which Buddhism adds mind as the sixth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n294" href="#fn294">294</a>]</sup> <i>Patisaraṇaṃ</i>. "Resort" is a somewhat desperate attempt (after Woodward) to find an equivalent. Probably not from <i>saraṇa</i> "refuge" but from <i>sarati</i> (PED) in the sense of "referring back." Woodward refers to DN 3, I, 28 (final verse) (=<i>Dial.</i> i, 122n.). The word is rendered "repository" by I. B. Horner at MLS 43 (SN i. 355). In a somewhat similar context in M44, <i>patibhāga</i> ("counterpart": I. B. Horner, MLS i, 367) is used.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n295" href="#fn295">295</a>]</sup> At first glance one might suppose that Uṇṇābha was either thinking in terms of a "self" or trying to trap the Buddha into admitting the existence of one, but since we learn that he was an <i>anāgāmin</i> (<a href="#n300">n. 300</a>), this is not so. Cf. <a href="#p36">&sect; 36</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n296" href="#fn296">296</a>]</sup> This may in effect be a play on words, since <i>patisaraṇaṃ</i> here can well be taken as "protection," i.e., differently derived from that in  <a href="#n294">n. 294</a>. Something of the effect could be achieved by rendering above: "to what (<i>or</i> whom) do the faculties <i>report</i>?, and here: "to what (whom) does mind <i>resort</i> (for protection)?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n297" href="#fn297">297</a>]</sup> Here rather in the sense of  <a href="#n294">n. 294</a>. Cf. the discussion by Mrs Rhys Davids in BPE, introduction, p. lxxxvī.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n298" href="#fn298">298</a>]</sup> The "immersion" is of course metaphorical, since there is nothing, and nobody, that "enters" Nibbāna! We may compare the well-known concluding line of Sir Edwin Arnold's <i>The Light of Asia</i>: "The dewdrop slips into the shining sea."</p>
				
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n299" href="#fn299">299</a>]</sup> Woodward translates too literally "were to make an end," which suggests suicide. This is not implied by <i>kālaṃ kareyya</i>, which is merely an idiomatic expression for dying.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n300" href="#fn300">300</a>]</sup> This means that he is an <i>anāgāmin</i> or ṇon-Returner" who, having destroyed the five lower fetters (see Vol. I, n. 83, will not return to this world.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n301" href="#fn301">301</a>]</sup> Reverting to <i>jangalānaṃ</i> in Feer's text, as opposed to Woodward's "creatures as roam about" based a dubious <i>jangaman.am</i> (for <i>cankamanaṃ</i>) of some MSS.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n302" href="#fn302">302</a>]</sup> <i>Padāni</i> lit. "feet" is an untranslatable pun. <i>Padaṃ</i> "foot" has even more metaphorical meanings in Pali than the English word: see PED.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n303" href="#fn303">303</a>]</sup> <i>Paññindriya</i>. The fifth of the five "spiritual faculties": 1. Faith (<i>saddhā</i>), 2. Energy (<i>viriya</i>), 3. Mindfulness (<i>sati</i>), 4. Concentration (<i>samādhi</i>), 5. Wisdom (<i>paññā</i>). See BD s.v. <i>Indriya</i> and also <i>Indriya-samatta</i>. It will be noticed that these five partly overlap with the seven <i>bojjhangas</i> (<a href="#n260">n. 260</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n304" href="#fn304">304</a>]</sup> These are, of course, the standard formulations for referring to the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. They seem to fit awkwardly into the context here and may have been interpolated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n305" href="#fn305">305</a>]</sup> These terms are used of Sāriputta at SN 2.9 (not translated here). Cf. the distinction between difficult and easy progress in VM XXI, 117.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n306" href="#fn306">306</a>]</sup> Theosophists and others maintain that rebirth as an animal, after a human existence, is impossible. This view is not supported by the Buddhist texts of any school.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n307" href="#fn307">307</a>]</sup> Cf.  <a href="#n300">n. 300</a>. This is the <i>anāgāmin</i> or ṇon-Returner."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n308" href="#fn308">308</a>]</sup> I.e., not born from a womb by spontaneously arising in another world (in this case the "Pure Abodes" (<i>suddhāvāsā</i>), where they will attain to final release without returning to this world).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n309" href="#fn309">309</a>]</sup> These are the first three of the five lower fetters (<i>orambhāgiya-saṃyojanāni</i> Vol. I, n. 83), i.e., <i>sakkāya-diṭṭhi</i> "personality-view" or belief in a permanent, really existing self; <i>vicikicchā</i> "doubt" (once the "personality-view" has been shattered, there can be no further fundamental doubt about the Dhamma); and <i>sīlabbata-parāmāsa</i> "attachment to rites and rituals" (<i>sīla</i> + <i>vata</i>). It is noteworthy that even at this (second) stage on the Path, sensuality (<i>kāmarāga</i>) and ill-will (<i>vyāpāda</i>), the fourth and fifth fetters, are only weakened but not destroyed. Their destruction is, however, inevitable.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n310" href="#fn310">310</a>]</sup> An encouraging message for many! Cf. the end of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p22">MN 22</a>, and also the charming image of the new-born calf in MN 34. The Commentary (MA) to MN 22 says such people are termed "lesser stream-winners" (<i>cuulasotāpannā</i>). This term is discussed in VM XIX, 27. The stress laid here on the importance of faith is interesting in view of later developments such as the Pure Land Schools (e.g., Jodo-Shishu or "Shin-Buddhism" in Japan).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n311" href="#fn311">311</a>]</sup> Sarakāni in fact became a Stream-winner at the moment of death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n312" href="#fn312">312</a>]</sup> "You are putting the cart before the horse!"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n313" href="#fn313">313</a>]</sup> The siṃsapā, a tall and beautiful tree, is the Dalbergia sisu, also known as the Asoka tree.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n314" href="#fn314">314</a>]</sup> This famous saying has been taken to justify the doctrines of various Mahāyāna schools, Theosophy and so on. While it may do so in many cases, the real meaning is somewhat different. The Buddha was naturally aware of many things, unknown to others, which he did not deem it necessary to teach for the gaining of enlightenment. We can accept, even without interpreting full enlightenment vulgarly as "omniscience," that the Buddha was at least potentially aware of whatever he wished or needed to know. He knew precisely which religious and philosophical doctrines that were or might be propounded were (<i>a</i>) true and (<i>b</i>) conducive to enlightenment. He borrowed nothing, as such, from previous systems because he did not need to, but he gave his approval to whatever conformed to these criteria.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It has occasionally been urged that if the Buddha was really all-enlightened, he must have been able to foresee modern scientific discoveries. In fact, he probably could have done so, but that was not his task, and he will certainly have been more aware than such critics of the dangers inherent in modern discoveries, with their power not only to destroy but also to corrupt. As a matter of fact he did not even utilize a very basic technical device which was known in his time' — the art of writing. He clearly preferred that his teachings should be preserved orally by those attempting to practice them and indeed the oral tradition has continued to this day. (Cf. T.W. Rhys Davids, <i>Buddhist India</i>, London 1903, pp. 107ff.). There is, however, one "modern science" which the Buddha not only anticipated but far surpassed: psychology. The superiority of Buddhist psychological insights to the findings of the West can be readily verified (some examples can be found in this Anthology). Cf. Nyanaponika Thera <i>Abhidhamma Studies</i> (BPS 1965), and Douglas M. Burns, <i>Buddhist Meditation and Depth Psychology</i> (WH 88-89).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">We may compare the saying quoted here with another, no less famous one occurring at SN 47.9 (not included in this Anthology) as well as in the <i>Mahaparinibbana Sutta</i>, <i>Dial</i>. 16, ī, 25 (= D ī, 100): <i>Desito ānanda mayā dhammo anantaram abāhiram katvā. natth'ānanda Tathāgatassa dhammesu ācariyamutthi</i> "I have taught Dhamma, Ananda, making no 'inner' and 'outer': the Tathāgata has no 'teacher's fist' in respect of the doctrines." There is, of course, no contradiction between the two statements, which in fact point once again to the middle way between the extremes. Both equally imply that whatever else the Buddha may have been aware of about the world, he taught just what was needed for the gaining of enlightenment, holding back nothing, but refraining from imparting irrelevant information. As the life of the monks was pared down to essentials, so was the teaching.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is fair to suggest that here, in the Pali Canon, we have the Buddhist teaching presented in its purest and simplest form, in the words of the Teacher himself. This statement is not meant to be in any way polemical, or to claim that doctrines developed in the later, so-called Mahāyāna schools are necessarily wrong. Recent research, indeed, has conclusively shown that the germ of many such doctrines can be traced back to the Pali Canon. For instance, there is little real conflict between the ideas expressed by Nāgārjuna, founder of the Madhyamika school, and the Theravāda (a school with which he was almost certainly entirely unacquainted). Likewise, while the proposition recently put forward that Zen is the "Theravāda of Japan" can scarcely be literally maintained, the idea nevertheless contains a strong element of truth, since Zen visibly represents and effort to rid later Buddhism of some of the accretions that had tended to obscure the original message. Zen, too, inclines more to something like the Arahant ideal of Theravāda than to that of the Bodhisattva. On the other hand, it should not be overlooked that the Bodhisattva career is one that is open to followers of the Theravāda school (cf.  <a href="#n51">n. 51</a> and the work of Bhikkhu Bodhi there mentioned; also the Ven. W. Rahula's <i>Zen and the Taming of the Bull</i> (Bedford 1978). And, as indicated in  <a href="#n310">n. 310</a>, even the apparently extremist Pure Land schools with their emphasis on faith receive rather more support from the Pali Canon than is sometimes thought. In this context K. Mizuno, <i>Primitive Buddhism</i>, tranl. K. Yamamoto (Oyama 1969) is of interest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Finally, in connection with the relation of "Buddhism and Science," the wise words of an American astronaut, Ed Mitchell, in a recent TV program may be quoted. He said: "Science is a methodology. As a belief system, it is disastrous." Buddhism, it may be urged, is a spiritual methodology analogous to that of physical science, which makes the acceptance of <i>any</i> pure "belief system" superfluous.</p>
