					<h4><a id="intro">Translator's Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha, the basic code of discipline for bhikkhunis, contains 311 rules. Of these, 181 are shared with the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha: four Parajikas, seven Saṅghadisesas, 18 Nissaggiya Pacittiyas (NP), 70 Pacittiyas, all 75 Sekhiyas, and all seven Adhikarana-samatha rules. In addition, the Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha contains 13 Pacittiya rules that are identical to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas; one Parajika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghadisesa rule; one Parajika rule similar to a Bhikkhus' Pacittiya rule; two Saṅghadisesa rules similar to Bhikkhus' Khandhaka rules; one NP rule similar to a Bhikkhus' NP; two Pacittiyas similar to a Bhikkhus' Saṅghadisesa; five Pacittiyas similar to Bhikkhus' Pacittiyas; and eight Pacittiyas similar to rules for bhikkhus that are contained in the Khandhakas. Also, the eight Patidesaniya rules for the bhikkhunis are elaborations of a single Bhikkhus' Pacittiya rule.</p>

					<p>Thus the Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha contains 89 rules for which there are no direct correspondences in the rules for the bhikkhus. Some writers have interpreted these added rules as sign of an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunis unfairly, but it should be noted that:</p>

					<p class="in2">(1) more than one third of these extra rules were formulated to protect bhikkhunis from being the direct victims of the abusive or careless behavior of other bhikkhunis;</p>

					<p class="in2">(2) two of the extra rules (Pacittiyas <a href="#Pc6">6</a> and <a href="#Pc44">44</a>) prevent bhikkhunis from putting themselves in a position of servitude to bhikkhus or lay people;</p>

					<p class="in2">(3) according to the rules' origin stories, all but three of the extra rules (Pacittiyas <a href="#Pc59">59</a>, <a href="#Pc94">94</a>, and <a href="#Pc95">95</a>) were formulated only after bhikkhunis complained to the bhikkhus about an errant bhikkhuni's behavior.</p>

					<p>Tellingly, these last three exceptions were formulated after complaints initiated by the bhikkhus, and they touch directly on the formal subordination of the Bhikkhuni Community to the Bhikkhu Community. However, they are counterbalanced by two rules exclusive to the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha -- <a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#NP4">NP 4</a> and <a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#NP17">17</a> -- that were formulated at the request of bhikkhunis to prevent the bhikkhus from abusing their position in the hierarchy in a way that would interfere with the bhikkhunis' practice of the Dhamma. For a more detailed discussion of the checks and balances in the relationships between the two Communities, see <i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> volume II, chapter 23.</p>

					<p>In the following translation, I have marked the correspondences between the bhikkhus' and bhikkhunis' rules in brackets. Where the brackets follow the number of the bhikkhuni rule and simply contain a number, the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is in the same section in the Bhikkhu Pāṭimokkha as in the Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha. Thus, under the Saṅghadisesa rules, <b>7 [5]</b> means that the Bhikkhunis' Saṅghadisesa 7 is identical with the Bhikkhus' Saṅghadisesa 5. If the brackets follow the rule and simply contain a reference to a rule in the Mahavagga (Mv) or Cullavagga (Cv), the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is contained in the Khandhakas. If the brackets follow the rule and include the word "see" followed by a number, the corresponding bhikkhus' rule is similar rather than identical. Correspondences in the Sekhiya and Adhikarana-samatha sections are not marked, as these two sections are completely identical in the two Pāṭimokkhas.</p>

					<p>Rules marked with an asterisk (*) are identical with -- or directly related to -- vows included in the Eight Garudhammas, or Vows of Respect. On this topic, see <i>The Buddhist Monastic Code,</i> volume II, chapter 23. Some writers have argued that, because the rules in question are all pacittiya rules, and because the Vows of Respect impose a more stringent penalty than a simple confession for overstepping the vows, we must assume that the vows and their more stringent punishment were added later to the canon, in an attempt to oppress the bhikkhunis. However, a standard principle throughout the Vinaya -- formulated in Adhikarana-samatha 4 in both Pāṭimokkhas -- is that an offender cannot be penalized until he/she has confessed to an offense. In light of this principle, the confession required by the pacittiya rules would be a first, necessary step before imposing the half-month penance stipulated in the fifth vow.</p>

					<p>The translation here is based on the complete Pali Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha in Mohan Wijayaratna, <i>Buddhist Nuns: The Birth and Development of a Women's Monastic Order</i> (BN), although there were many spots where I had to rely on the Thai edition of the Pali Canon to correct mistakes in BN. I have also consulted I.B. Horner's partial English translation of the Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha rules in <i>The Book of Discipline,</i> volume three (BD); the partial Thai translation included in Mahamakut's complete translation of the Pali Canon; and the complete English translation in BN. Where my translation differs from BD, I have marked it with a (&#167;); where it differs from BN, a (&#182;); where it differs from both, a (&#167;&#182;).</p>
					<p>Parenthetical insertions in the rules, if otherwise unmarked, are based on the canonical word-commentary from the Bhikkhuni Vibhanga, the part of the Vinaya Pitaka that contains the Bhikkhuni Pāṭimokkha together with its explanatory material. If marked with the abbreviation "Comm," parenthetical insertions in the rules are drawn from the Commentary, Buddhaghosa's <i>Samantapasadika. </i>Technical issues are explained in the endnotes.</p>

					<h1><a id="Pr">Parajika</a></h1>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr1">1</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Pr1">1</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni willingly engage in the sexual act, even with a male animal, she is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr2">2</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Pr2">2</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni, in the manner of stealing, take what is not given from an inhabited area or from the wilderness -- just as when, in the taking of what is not given, kings arresting the criminal would flog, imprison, or banish her, saying, "You are a robber, you are a fool, you are benighted, you are a thief" -- a bhikkhuni in the same way taking what is not given is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr3">3</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Pr3">3</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni intentionally deprive a human being of life, or search for an assassin for her, or praise the advantages of death, or incite her to die (thus): "My good man, what use is this wretched, miserable life to you? Death would be better for you than life," or with such an idea in mind, such a purpose in mind, should in various ways praise the advantages of death or incite her to die, she also is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr4">4</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Pr4">4</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni, without direct knowledge, boast of a superior human state, a truly noble knowledge and vision as present in herself, saying, "Thus do I know; thus do I see," such that regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, she -- being remorseful and desirous of purification -- might say, "Ladies, not knowing, I said I know; not seeing, I said I see -- vainly, falsely, idly," unless it was from over-estimation, she also is defeated and no longer in communion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr5">5</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, consent to a lusting man's rubbing, rubbing up against, taking hold of, touching, or fondling (her) below the collar-bone and above the circle of the knees, she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being "one above the circle of the knees." [See <a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Sg2">Bhikkhus' Saṅghadisesa 2</a>]</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr6">6</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, knowing that (another) bhikkhuni has fallen into an act (entailing) defeat, neither accuse her herself nor inform the group, and then -- whether she (the other bhikkhuni) is still alive or has died, has been expelled or gone over to another sect -- she (this bhikkhuni) should say, "Even before, ladies, I knew of this bhikkhuni that 'This sister is of such-and-such a sort,' and I didn't accuse her myself nor did I inform the group," then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being "one who concealed a fault." [See <a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Pc64">Bhikkhus' Pacittiya 64</a>]</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr7">7</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni follow a bhikkhu suspended by a Community (of bhikkhus) acting in harmony, in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions, and he is disrespectful, has not made amends, has broken off his friendship (with the bhikkhus), the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: "Lady, that bhikkhu has been suspended by a community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions. He is disrespectful, he has not made amends, he has broken off his friendship. Do not follow him, lady."</p>

					<p class="f4">And should that bhikkhuni, admonished thus by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for being "a follower of a suspended (bhikkhu)." (&#167;&#182;)</p>
					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Pr8">8</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, consent to a lusting man's taking hold of her hand or touching the edge of her outer robe, or should she stand with him or converse with him or go to a rendezvous with him, or should she consent to his approaching her, or should she enter a hidden place with him, or should she dispose her body to him -- (any of these) for the purpose of that unrighteous act (Comm: physical contact) -- then she also is defeated and no longer in communion for "(any of) eight grounds." (&#167;)</p>

					<h1><a id="Sg">Saṅghadisesa</a></h1>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg1">1</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni start a legal case against a householder, a householder's son, a slave, or a worker, or even against a wandering contemplative: this bhikkhuni, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg2">2</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni knowingly ordain a woman thief sentenced to death, without having obtained permission from the king or the Community or the (governing) council or the (governing) committee or the (governing) guild -- unless the woman is allowable (i.e., already ordained in another sect or with other bhikkhunis) -- this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. [See Mv.I.43.1]</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg3">3</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni go among villages alone or go to the other shore of a river alone or stay away for a night alone or fall behind her companion(s) alone: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg4">4</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni -- without having obtained permission from the Community who performed the act, without knowing the desire of the group -- restore a bhikkhuni whom a Community acting harmony in line with the Dhamma, in line with the Vinaya, in line with the teacher's instructions, has suspended: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community. [See Cv.I.28-29]</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg5">5</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, lusting, having received staple or non-staple food from the hand of a lusting man, consume or chew it: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg6">6</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni say, "What does it matter to you whether this man is lusting or not, when you are not lusting? Please, lady, take what the man is giving -- staple or non-staple food -- with your own hand and consume or chew it": this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg7">7</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Sg5">5</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni engage in conveying a man's intentions to a woman or a woman's intentions to a man, proposing marriage or paramourage -- even if only for a momentary liaison: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg8">8</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Sg8">8</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni, malicious, angered, displeased, charge a (fellow) bhikkhuni with an unfounded case involving defeat, (thinking), "Surely with this I may bring about her fall from the celibate life," then regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the bhikkhuni confesses her anger: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg9">9</a></b> [<a href="vp.bhikkhupat.than.ati.htm#Sg9">9</a>]. Should any bhikkhuni, malicious, angered, displeased, using as a mere ploy an aspect of an issue that pertains otherwise, charge a bhikkhuni with a case involving defeat, (thinking), "Surely with this I may bring about her fall from the celibate life," then regardless of whether or not she is cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue pertains otherwise, an aspect used as a mere ploy, and the bhikkhuni confesses her anger: this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the first act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg10">10</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, angry and displeased, say, "I repudiate the Buddha, I repudiate the Dhamma, I repudiate the Saṅgha, I repudiate the Training. Since when were the Sakyan-daughter contemplatives the only contemplatives? There are other contemplatives who are conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training. I will practice the holy life in their company," the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: "Lady, don't -- angry and displeased -- say, 'I repudiate the Buddha, I repudiate the Dhamma, I repudiate the Saṅgha, I repudiate the Training. Since when were the Sakyan-daughter contemplatives the only contemplatives? There are other contemplatives who are conscientious, scrupulous, and desirous of training.

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg11">11</a>.</b> Should any bhikkhuni, turned down in even a trifling issue, angry and displeased, say, "The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear," the bhikkhunis should admonish her thus: "Lady, don't -- turned down in even a trifling issue, angry and displeased -- say, 'The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear. It may be that you, lady, are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear."</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="Sg12">12</a>.</b> In case bhikkhunis are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety (depraved in their livelihood), exasperating the Bhikkhuni Community, hiding one another's faults, the bhikkhunis should admonish them thus: "The sisters are living entangled, depraved in their conduct, depraved in their reputation, depraved in their notoriety. Split up (your group), ladies. The Community recommends isolation for the sisters."</p>

					<p class="f4">And should those bhikkhunis, thus admonished, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke them up to three times so as to desist.

There are other bhikkhunis in the Community with the same conduct, the same reputation, the same notoriety, exasperating the Bhikkhuni Community, hiding one another's faults, but the Community doesn't say anything to them.

					<p class="f4">And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished by the bhikkhunis, say about the bhikkhunis, "The bhikkhunis are prejudiced by favoritism, prejudiced by aversion, prejudiced by delusion, prejudiced by fear, in that for this sort of offense they banish some and do not banish others," the bhikkhunis are to admonish her thus: "Do not say that, lady. The bhikkhunis are not prejudiced by favoritism, are not prejudiced by aversion, are not prejudiced by delusion, are not prejudiced by fear. You, lady, are a corrupter of families, a woman of depraved conduct. Your depraved conduct is both seen and heard about, and the families you have corrupted are both seen and heard about. Leave this monastery, lady. Enough of your staying here."</p>
					<p class="f4">And should that bhikkhuni, thus admonished by the bhikkhunis, persist as before, the bhikkhunis are to rebuke her up to three times so as to desist. If while being rebuked up to three times she desists, that is good. If she does not desist, then this bhikkhuni, also, as soon as she has fallen into the third act of offence, is to be (temporarily) driven out, and it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</p>

					<h1><a id="As">Adhikarana-Samatha</a></h1>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As1">1</a>.</b> <i>A verdict "in the presence of" should be given.</i> This means that the formal act settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community, in the presence of the individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As2">2</a>.</b> <i>A verdict of mindfulness may be given.</i> This is the verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that she did not commit the offense in question.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As3">3</a>.</b> <i>A verdict of past insanity may be given.</i> This is another verdict of innocence given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused was out of her mind when she committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any responsibility for it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As4">4</a>.</b> <i>Acting in accordance with what is admitted</i>. This refers to the ordinary confession of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The confession is valid only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a bhikkhuni actually commits a pacittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger or lesser offense. If she were to confess it as a dukkata or a Saṅghadisesa, that would be invalid.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As5">5</a>.</b> <i>Acting in accordance with the majority.</i> This refers to cases in which bhikkhunis are unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the proper procedures are followed, and -- in the words of the Canon -- are "wounding one another with weapons of the tongue." In cases such as these, decisions can be made by majority vote.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As6">6</a>.</b> <i>Acting in accordance with the accused's further misconduct.</i> This refers to cases where a bhikkhuni admits to having committed the offense in question only after being formally interrogated about it. She is then to be reproved for her actions, made to remember the offense and to confess it, after which the Community carries out a formal act of "further misconduct" against her as an added punishment for being so uncooperative as to require the formal interrogation in the first place.</p>
					<p class="f4"><b><a id="As7">7</a>.</b> <i>Covering over as with grass.</i> This refers to situations in which both sides of a dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have done much that is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one another for their offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus if both sides agree, all the bhikkhunis gather in one place. (According to the Commentary, this means that all bhikkhunis in the <i>sima</i> must attend. No one should send her consent, and even sick bhikkhunis must go.) A motion is made to the entire group that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side then makes a formal motion to the members of her faction that she will make a confession for them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side addresses the entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a motion and one announcement (<i>natti-dutiya-kamma</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> When a Community's kathina privileges are in effect, all cloth presented to the their residence is in-season cloth, and it is to be distributed only among the residents who spent the rains retreat in that residence and participated in the spreading of the kathina (see Mv.VII.1.3). Other bhikkhunis have no share in it. However, if donors wish to give cloth to those other bhikkhunis, they can declare their intention, in which the cloth -- even though given "in-season" -- counts as out-of-season cloth. In this case, the later arrivals have a right to a share. In the origin story to this rule, donors make such a gift. The offending bhikkhuni, not wanting to share the gift with the later arrivals for whom it was intended, declares it to be in-season cloth, and shares it only with the bhikkhunis who spent the rains retreat in that residence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The origin story here shows that lay donors, of their own initiative, set the fund aside with a storekeeper for one purpose, and then the bhikkhuni asks for it to be transferred -- apparently to another store -- and buys something else with it. This condition also applies to <a href="#NP9">NP 9</a> and <a href="#NP10">NP10</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This rule was formulated after bhikkhunis went off on a journey without their outer robes, thus inconveniencing the bhikkhunis who stayed behind, who had to sun the robes to keep them from going moldy. The Word-commentary states that a bhikkhuni, at least once every five days, must put on or dry in the sun all five of her robes: this is the five-day outer robe period.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> BD misinterprets not only the rule here, but also its explanatory material in the Bhikkhuni Vibhanga. The Pali of the rule is: <i>Ya pana bhikkhuni gihi-veyyavaccam kareyya, pacittiyanti.</i> BD translates it as: "Whatever nun should do household work, there is an offence of expiation." <i>Gihi,</i> however, means lay person or, more literally, "house-person," not household. This is confirmed by the word-commentary's definition of <i>gihi-veyyavaccam:</i> "She cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for a person living in a house <i>(agarika)."</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">In the non-offense clauses, BD translates <i>attano veyyavaccakarassa</i> as "in doing household work for herself<i>.</i>" This omits the <i>-kara-</i> in the second term, thus changing <i>veyyavaccakara</i> (chore-doer) to <i>veyyavacca</i> (chore). The correct translation is, "for her own chore-doer."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Thus the non-offense clauses, as a set, read: "There is no offense in conjey-drink, in a community meal, in homage to a chedi, or if she cooks conjey or a meal or a non-staple food, or washes a piece of clothing or a head-wrap for her own chore-doer." The Commentary explains: <b>"In conjey-drink, etc.:</b> When people are making a community meal or a conjey-drink for the purpose of the Community, there is no offense in her doing any cooking at all in the position of being a friend of theirs. <b>In homage to a chedi: </b>It is all right if, being a friend, she does homage with scents, etc. <b>For her own chore-doer:</b> Even if (her) mother and father come and are making/doing something (such as) a fan or a broom handle and so stand in the position of a chore-doer, it is all right to cook anything (for them)."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In the origin story, a bhikkhuni spreads lies about the road to a particular family's house, saying that it is infested with fierce dogs and a wild bull, in order to discourage other bhikkhunis from going there and receiving a share of the family's donations.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The six precepts are the first six of the eight precepts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> In the origin story, the new bhikkhuni's husband seizes her right after her ordination.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> "Left-over giving of consent" <i>(parivasika-chanda-dana)</i> means that consent has been given by the Community of bhikkhus in that territory for a particular group to conduct Community business, but then the group gets up and leaves before dealing with the issue in question (on this point, see Mv.II.36.4). In the origin story for this rule, the offending bhikkhuni dismisses the group that had received consent to carry out the Acceptance transaction and then -- under the ruse of the consent given to that group -- convenes another group of bhikkhus less likely to pay attention to the deficiencies in the candidate she is proposing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Asking a question related to the Vinaya can be the first step in admonishment and making accusations (see Mv.II.15.6-8), which is why this rule is related to the eighth of the eight vows of respect (against a bhikkhuni admonishing a bhikkhu). As Horner notes in BD, the word-commentary to this rule is one of the few places in the Vinaya that apparently refers to the Abhidhamma as a text -- thus indicating that either the rule or its word-commentary is a later formulation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> "An unordained person": The Pali here has the feminine form -- unordained female person -- but none of the commentaries explain why.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> "An unordained person": Again, the Pali here has the feminine form -- unordained female person -- but none of the commentaries explain why.</p>
