					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>The Buddha's disciples, when listening to the Dhamma, were presented with a challenge: how to best memorize it. The Buddha repeatedly made it clear that memorization was an important part of listening for the sake of their own training. He also made it clear that he wanted to establish the Dhamma and Vinaya for a long time, so his monastic disciples had the added responsibilty of memorizing the Dhamma to pass on to others. The Buddha helped by formulating and presenting the Dhamma in a way that made it easy to memorize, such as arranging talks with numerical lists, providing striking similes, and composing verses whose rhythm and word-play made them memorable. But it was up to the disciples to choose the formats in which they would organize their memories of what the Buddha taught.</p>

					<p>They ended up using a wide variety of formats. In some cases, they memorized whole talks. In others, they memorized dialogues, drawing portraits of the Buddha's interlocutors. In others, they provided numerically arranged catechisms of the Buddha's basic concepts. The different formats had different strengths and weaknesses. The dialogues, for instance, provided context, showing which questions and problems a particular Dhamma teaching was designed to answer. Their character sketches and narratives, sometimes quite vivid, provided human interest that mere lists of dhammas would lack. However, the dialogues were unwieldy in that a great deal of effort had to be put into memorizing details of character, location, and narrative sequence. Catechisms avoided this problem by focusing totally on the words of the Dhamma, without the context of a dialog or similes. For this reason, they were a more efficient form than dialogues for passing along material. This, however, was material stripped of context, so that it was harder to see what role individual teachings might play in the larger context of the path or in the personal context of solving particular problems faced in the practice.</p>

					<p>It was perhaps because of their complementary strengths and weaknesses that all these formats for shaping the memory of the Buddha's teachings were used and preserved. This seems especially likely in the case of the last two suttas of the Dīgha Nikāya: the present one, DN 33, and the one following it. Most of the other suttas included in the Dīgha are of a literary nature, with some extreme cases consisting almost entirely of descriptive passages with very little Dhamma. Modern scholars have speculated that these suttas were composed with the primary aim of appealing to the populace at large: Their literary style and sophistication made them attractive tools for converting outsiders. In this context, the catechisms in DN 33 and 34 provided compensation: all Dhamma with only a minimum of description. As a result, monastics who memorized the Dīgha would have a large fund of basic Dhamma lists to draw on when giving sermons or seeking guidance for their own practice.</p>

					<p>There is the question of when DN 33 was composed. Some people have suggested that all the numerically arranged catechisms — these suttas plus suttas like <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/khp/idx_khp.htm#IV">Khp 4</a>, AN 10:27, and AN 10:28 — postdated the Buddha. It's obvious that the idea of arranging teachings in this way would occur to his disciples only when there was a large body of material to memorize. Even though people of his time were capable of prodigious feats of memory, not everyone had developed that ability, and it would have made sense to organize lists of teachings in a more streamlined format for their sake. However, the need for this format could easily have made itself felt during the latter part of the Buddha's lifetime. In fact, these catechisms could have been what other suttas were referring to when they mentioned Abhidhamma (Higher Dhamma) or Mātikā (Lists).</p>

					<p>However, DN 33 raises some special questions in this area. Although the majority of its contents can be traced to other parts of the Canon, it also contains lists that appear nowhere else in the suttas, and some of these lists — such as the threefold classification of form and the three faculties — contain vocabulary found elsewhere in the Canon only in the Abhidhamma Piṭaka. This suggests that, at least in its current incarnation, DN 33 was a later composition. But as to whether it was composed entirely after the Buddha passed away, or if parts were composed earlier, with other parts added later, there's no way of telling. The sutta could have easily grown over the generations because its organization is so open-ended. The lists included in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p34">DN 34</a> are restricted to those whose members perform a set range of functions, whereas to qualify for inclusion in DN 33, a list would need only to contain a number of members ranging from one to ten.</p>

					<p>Although the material in this sutta is extremely varied, some specific categories stand out. To begin with, the Wings to Awakening — a list of Dhamma lists attributed to the Buddha himself (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">DN 16</a>) — are included almost in their entirety: almost, because one of the 37 factors in the Wings, the strength of conviction, was for some reason omitted, meaning that the five strengths here are reduced to four. All the dhammas listed in the shorter catechisms — <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/khp/idx_khp.htm#IV">Khp 4</a>, AN 10:27, and AN 10:28 — are also included. In addition, there are lists and explanations of virtues needed for the practice, contrasted in many cases with their opposing vices, along with some rudimentary instructions on how the Vinaya is to be followed for the sake of unity within the Saṇgha. There are also lists related to the virtues of the Buddha and his noble disciples, possible destinations of rebirth, the basic concepts of dependent co-arising, the various maps of concentration attainments, the noble attainments, and practices conducive to reaching the noble attainments.</p>

					<p>So even if this sutta is a later composition, it provides an interesting glimpse of what a group of monastics at a particular time in early Buddhist history saw as the most important of the teachings that a monk should know for his own practice, for the purpose of instructing people at large, and for passing on to succeeding generations.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Note</p>

					      <p class="in2">Some of the lists included in this sutta are fleshed out with explanations that, in many cases, quote almost the entirety of the suttas from which they are drawn; others are given only as lists of terms. In the footnotes, I have not identified the suttas that are extensively quoted here, and instead have focused on providing citations that will explain terms that this sutta does not.</p>

There he stayed near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmith's mango grove. Now, at that time a new reception hall named Ubbhataka had just been built by the Pāvā Mallans, and it had not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, brahman, or anyone at all in human form.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Pāvā Mallans heard, "The Blessed One, they say, wandering among the Mallans with a large Saṇgha of monks — approximately 500 monks in all — has arrived at Pāvā and is staying near Pāvā in Cunda the silversmith's mango grove."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Pāvā Mallans went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there they said to him, "Lord, a new reception hall named Ubbhataka has just been built by the Pāvā Mallans, and it has not yet been dwelled in by any contemplative, brahman, or anyone at all in human form. May the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, the Pāvā Mallans will use it afterwards. That will be for their long-term welfare and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One acquiesced with silence. Sensing his acquiescence, the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats, bowed down to him, circumambulated him, and then went to the new reception hall. On arrival, they spread it all over with felt rugs, arranged seats, set out a water vessel, and raised an oil lamp. Then they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, stood to one side. As they were standing there they said to him, "Lord, the reception hall has been covered all over with felt rugs, seats have been arranged, a water vessel has been set out, and an oil lamp raised. It is now time for the Blessed One to do as he sees fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One — after adjusting his under robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe — went together with the Saṇgha of monks to the reception hall. On arrival he washed his feet, entered the hall, and sat with his back to the central post, facing east. The Saṇgha of monks washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the western wall, facing east, ranged around the Blessed One. The Pāvā Mallans washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat with their backs to the eastern wall, facing west, ranged around the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One — having spent most of the night instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging the Pāvā Mallans with a Dhamma talk — dismissed them, saying, "The night is far gone, Vaseṭṭhas. Do what you think it is now time to do."</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, lord," to the Blessed One, the Pāvā Mallans got up from their seats and, bowing down to him and circumambulating him, left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after the Pāvā Mallans had left, the Blessed One — surveying the silent Saṇgha of monks — addressed Ven. Sāriputta, "Sāriputta, the Saṇgha of monks is free of drowsiness. Let yourself be inspired by a Dhamma talk for them. My back aches. I will rest it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Sāriputta responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, having had his outer robe arranged folded in four, lay down on his right side in the lion's sleeping posture, with one foot on top of the other, mindful and alert, having made a mental note to get up.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Now, on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had recently died in Pāvā. On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions. They kept arguing, quarreling, and disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth: "You don't understand this Dhamma-Vinaya. I understand this Dhamma-Vinaya. How could you understand this Dhamma-Vinaya? You practice wrongly. I practice rightly. I'm consistent. You're inconsistent. What should be said first, you said last. What should be said last, you said first. What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out. Your position has been overthrown. You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!" Nothing but slaughter, as it were, was being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons. Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seemed disenchanted, disgusted, and repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Ven. Sāriputta addressed the monks, "Friends, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has recently died in Pāvā. On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas have split into two factions.... Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, and repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, friends, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened. But our Dhamma of the Blessed One is well expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened. So it should all be recited together, without dispute, so that this holy life will endure and last a long time. That will be for the benefit and happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of devas and human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which is our Dhamma of the Blessed One that is well expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened, that should all be recited together, without dispute, so that this holy life will endure and last a long time, and that will be for the benefit and happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare, benefit, and happiness of devas and human beings?</p>
