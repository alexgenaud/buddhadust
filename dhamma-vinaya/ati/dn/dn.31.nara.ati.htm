					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Exalted One was dwelling in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary, near <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time, young <a id="sigala">Sigala</a>, a householder's son, rising early in the morning, departing from Rājagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worshipped with joined hands the various quarters — the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Exalted One, having robed himself in the forenoon took bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms. Now he saw young Sigala worshipping thus and spoke to him as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherefore do you, young householder, rising early in the morning, departing from Rājagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship, with joined hands these various quarters — the East, the South, the West, the North, the Nadir, and the Zenith?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"My father, Lord, while dying, said to me: The six quarters, dear son, you shall worship. And I, Lord, respecting, revering, reverencing and honoring my father's word, rise early in the morning, and leaving Rājagaha, with wet clothes and wet hair, worship with joined hands, these six quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is not thus, young householder, the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How then, Lord, should the six quarters be worshipped in the discipline of the noble? It is well, Lord, if the Exalted One would teach the doctrine to me showing how the six quarters should be worshipped in the discipline of the noble."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well, young householder, listen and bear it well in mind; I shall speak." — "Very good, Lord," responded young Sigala.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Exalted One spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inasmuch, young householder, as the noble disciple <b>(1)</b> has eradicated the four vices in conduct,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> <b>(2)</b> inasmuch as he commits no evil action in four ways, <b>(3)</b> inasmuch as he pursues not the six channels for dissipating wealth, he thus, avoiding these fourteen evil things, covers the six quarters, and enters the path leading to victory in both worlds: he is favored in this world and in the world beyond. Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, he is born in a happy heavenly realm.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(1)</b> "What are <a id="p4vices">the four vices</a> in conduct that he has eradicated? The destruction of life, householder, is a vice and so are stealing, sexual misconduct, and lying. These are the four vices that he has eradicated."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Killing, stealing, lying and adultery,<br />
					These four evils the wise never praise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(2)</b> "In which four ways does one commit no evil action? Led by desire does one commit evil. Led by anger does one commit evil. Led by ignorance does one commit evil. Led by fear does one commit evil.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"But inasmuch as the noble disciple is not led by desire, anger, ignorance, and fear, he commits no evil."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><a id="moon">Whoever</a> through desire, hate or fear,<br />
					Or ignorance should transgress the Dhamma,<br />
					All his glory fades away<br />
					Like the moon during the waning half.<br />
					Whoever through desire, hate or fear,<br />
					Or ignorance never transgresses the Dhamma,<br />
					All his glory ever increases<br />
					Like the moon during the waxing half.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(3)</b> "What are the six channels for dissipating wealth which he does not pursue?</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(a)</b> "indulgence in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness;<br />
					<b>(b)</b> sauntering in streets at unseemly hours;<br />
					<b>(c)</b> frequenting theatrical shows;<br />
					<b>(d)</b> indulgence in gambling which causes heedlessness;<br />
					<b>(e)</b> association with evil companions;<br />
					<b>(f)</b> the habit of idleness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="intox"><b>(a)</b></a> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in indulging in intoxicants which cause infatuation and heedlessness:</p>

					(iii) susceptibility to disease,<br />
					(iv) earning an evil reputation,<br />
					(v) shameless exposure of body,<br />

					<p class="f4"><b>(b)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) he himself is unprotected and unguarded,<br />
					(ii) his wife and children are unprotected and unguarded,<br />
					(iii) his property is unprotected and unguarded,<br />
					(iv) he is suspected of evil deeds,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />

					(vi) where is there pot-blowing?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(d)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in indulging in gambling:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) the winner begets hate,<br />
					(ii) the loser grieves for lost wealth,<br />
					(iii) loss of wealth,<br />
					(iv) his word is not relied upon in a court of law,<br />
					(v) he is despised by his friends and associates,<br />
					(vi) he is not sought after for matrimony; for people would say he is a gambler and is not fit to look after a wife.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(e)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in associating with evil companions, namely: any gambler, any libertine, any drunkard, any swindler, any cheat, any rowdy is his friend and companion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>(f)</b> "There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in being addicted to idleness:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He does no work, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) that it is extremely cold,<br />
					(ii) that it is extremely hot,<br />
					(iii) that it is too late in the evening,<br />
					(iv) that it is too early in the morning,<br />
					(v) that he is extremely hungry,<br />
					(vi) that he is too full.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Living in this way, he leaves many duties undone, new wealth he does not get, and wealth he has acquired dwindles away."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>

					<p class="f4">"One is a bottle friend; one says, 'friend, friend' only to one's face; one is a friend and an associate only when it is advantageous.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sleeping till sunrise, adultery, irascibility, malevolence, evil companions, avarice — these six causes ruin a man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The man who has evil comrades and friends is given to evil ways, to ruin does he fall in both worlds — here and the next.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dice, women, liquor, dancing, singing, sleeping by day, sauntering at unseemly hours, evil companions, avarice — these nine<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> causes ruin a man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="waning">Who plays</a> with dice and drinks intoxicants, goes to women who are dear unto others as their own lives, associates with the mean and not with elders — he declines just as the moon during the waning half.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who is drunk, poor, destitute, still thirsty whilst drinking, frequents the bars, sinks in debt as a stone in water, swiftly brings disrepute to his family.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who by habit sleeps by day, and keeps late hours, is ever intoxicated, and is licentious, is not fit to lead a household life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Who says it is too hot, too cold, too late, and leaves things undone, the opportunities for good go past such men.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But he who does not regard cold or heat any more than a blade of grass and who does his duties manfully, does not fall away from happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These four, young householder, should be understood as foes in the guise of friends:</p>

					(iv) he is a companion in indulging in gambling which causes heedlessness."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Exalted One. And when the Master had thus spoken, he spoke yet again:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These four, young householder, should be understood as warm-hearted friends:</p>

Even so, has the doctrine been explained in various ways by the Exalted One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I take refuge, Lord, in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha. May the Exalted One receive me as a lay follower; as one who has taken refuge from this very day to life's end."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> "The symbolism is deliberately chosen: as the day in the East, so life begins with parents' care; teacher's fees and the South are the same word: <i>dakkhina</i>; domestic cares follow when the youth becomes man, as the West holds the later daylight; North is 'beyond' <i>(uttara),</i> so by help of friends, etc., he gets beyond troubles." — (Rhys Davids)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This is a sacred custom of the Aryans who never forgot the dead. This tradition is still faithfully observed by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka who make ceremonial offerings of alms to the monks on the eighth day, in the third month, and on each anniversary of the demise of the parents. Merit of these good actions is offered to the departed after such ceremony. Moreover after every <i>punna-kamma</i> (good action), a Buddhist never fails to think of his parents and offer merit. Such is the loyalty and the gratitude shown to parents as advised by the Buddha.</p>
