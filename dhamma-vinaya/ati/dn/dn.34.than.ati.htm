It becomes a form of mental gymnastics by imposing on the structure that it be limited to ten sets fit within 10 specific concepts:  —  so that section 1 is 10 units of one item each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; the second is 10 units of 2 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10; on up to 10 units of 10 items each, each dealing with concepts 1-10." />

					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This sutta is the second of the two long catechisms that conclude the Dīgha Nikāya. It is similar to the preceding one in that it organizes its lists in terms of the number of members they contain, from one to ten, like a miniature Aṅguttara Nikāya. It also contains much of the same material as the preceding sutta, ending with the same list: the ten factors of an arahant's path. It differs from the preceding sutta in that it further organizes its lists in terms of ten categories:</p>
					
					<p>x dhammas that are very helpful,<br />
					x dhammas that should be developed,<br />
					x dhammas that should be comprehended,<br />
					x dhammas that should be abandoned,<br />
					x dhammas that are on the side of decline,<br />
					x dhammas that are on the side of distinction,<br />
					x dhammas that are hard to penetrate,<br />
					x dhammas that should be made to arise,<br />
					x dhammas that should be directly known,<br />
					x dhammas that should be realized.</p>
					
					<p>Four of these categories are derived from the duties appropriate to the four noble truths: comprehending stress, abandoning its origination, realizing its cessation, and developing the path to its cessation.</p>
					
					<p>Of the remaining categories, five are clearly related to these four: Dhammas that are very helpful, those on the side of distinction, those that should be made to arise, and those that should be directly known come under the duty to develop. Dhammas on the side of decline come under the duty to abandon.</p>
					
					<p>This leaves one category that is somewhat anomalous: dhammas that are hard to penetrate. Unlike the other categories, the dhammas in this category do not all perform similar functions. What they have in common is that they present difficulties: either in being hard to develop, hard to abandon, or hard to realize, or in presenting obstacles to the practice as a whole.</p>
					
					<p>Another anomaly is the final category of lists: dhammas that should be realized. Under the four noble truths, the duty of realization falls solely to the cessation of stress and its synonyms, such as release and dispassion. Here, however, many of the lists included in this category do not restrict themselves to release or cessation, but also include step-by-step practices leading to those attainments. In other words, they include practices that, strictly speaking, belong under the category of dhammas to be developed. Also, two of these lists — the eight emancipations and the nine step-by-step cessations — conclude with the cessation of perception and feeling. Some suttas treat this attainment as a step leading inevitably to the ending of the effluents (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p34">AN 9:34</a>; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p38">AN 9:38–40</a>); others, such as <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p31">AN 9:31–33</a>, treat it simply as a concentration attainment. In either case, though, it is an attainment that belongs to the path, and so should be developed rather than realized.</p>
					
					<p>This sutta also differs from the preceding one in that it contains no material from the Vinaya, and there are proportionally fewer lists that do not appear in other suttas.</p>
					
					<p>As is the case with the preceding sutta, this sutta is hard to date. However, unlike that sutta — whose open-ended organization would have allowed succeeding generations to keep adding material to expand it — the tighter organization of this sutta suggests that it was the work of a single generation of compilers, if not a single compiler. Whether the compiler(s) lived in the time of the Buddha or after, there is no way of knowing. But here again we have a sutta that gives an interesting glimpse of what a group of monastics at a time in early Buddhist history saw as the most important of the teachings that a monk should know for his own practice, for the purpose of instructing people at large, and for passing on to succeeding generations.</p>

But when attending to renunciation, his mind leaps up at renunciation, grows confident, steadfast, and released in renunciation.

					<p class="f4">• "Which six dhammas should be realized?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Six direct knowledges:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case, friends, where a monk wields manifold supranormal powers. Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one. He appears. He vanishes. He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains as if through space. He dives in and out of the earth as if it were water. He walks on water without sinking as if it were dry land. Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air like a winged bird. With his hand he touches and strokes even the sun and moon, so mighty and powerful. He exercises influence with his body even as far as the Brahmā worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He hears — by means of the divine ear-element, purified and surpassing the human — both kinds of sounds: divine and human, whether near or far.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns the awareness of other beings, other individuals, having encompassed it with his own awareness. He discerns a mind with passion as 'a mind with passion,' and a mind without passion as 'a mind without passion.' He discerns a mind with aversion as 'a mind with aversion,' and a mind without aversion as 'a mind without aversion.' He discerns a mind with delusion as 'a mind with delusion,' and a mind without delusion as 'a mind without delusion.' He discerns a restricted mind as 'a restricted mind,' and a scattered mind as 'a scattered mind.' He discerns an enlarged mind as 'an enlarged mind,' and an unenlarged mind as 'an unenlarged mind.' He discerns a surpassed mind [one that is not at the most excellent level] as 'a surpassed mind,' and an unsurpassed mind as 'an unsurpassed mind.' He discerns a concentrated mind as 'a concentrated mind,' and an unconcentrated mind as 'an unconcentrated mind.' He discerns a released mind as 'a released mind,' and an unreleased mind as 'an unreleased mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction and expansion, (recollecting,) 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He sees — by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in a good destination, a heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and he discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Through the ending of the effluents, he enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here-and-now.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Akuppa.</i> This term is sometimes translated as "unshakable," but it literally means, "unprovoked." The reference is apparently to the theory of <i>dhātu,</i> or properties underlying physical or psychological events in nature. The physical properties according to this theory are four: earth (solidity), liquid, heat, and wind (motion). Three of them — liquid, heat, and wind — are potentially active. When they are aggravated, agitated, or provoked — the Pali term here, <i>pakuppati,</i> is used also on the psychological level, where it means angered or upset — they act as the underlying cause for natural activity. When the provocation ends, the corresponding activity subsides. (See the description of the physical properties in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p28">MN 28</a>.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt">A similar theory attributes the irruption of mental states to the provocation of the properties of sensuality, form, or formlessness.</p>

							<p class="in4">"In dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensuality. In dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality... the desire for sensuality... the fever for sensuality... the quest for sensuality. Searching for sensuality, monks, an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person conducts himself wrongly through three means: through body, through speech, and through mind." — <i>SN 14:12</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">Even unbinding is described as a property (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p44">Iti 44</a>). However, there is a crucial difference in how unbinding is attained, in that the unbinding property is not provoked. Any events that depend on the provocation of a property are inherently unstable and inconstant, subject to change when the provocation ends. But because true release is not caused by the provocation of anything, it is not subject to change.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Thus, knowledge of the unprovoked or unprovoked knowledge would be knowledge of unbinding.</p>
