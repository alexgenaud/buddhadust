					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had just died in Pāvā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They kept arguing, quarreling, &amp; disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"You don't understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How could you understand this Dhamma-Vinaya?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You practice wrongly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm consistent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You're inconsistent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What should be said first, you said last.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What should be said last, you said first.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Your position has been overthrown.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Nothing but slaughter, as it were, was being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seemed disenchanted, disgusted, &amp; repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Cunda the novice, who had spent the Rains at Pāvā, went to Ven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ānanda at Sāmagāma and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ānanda, "Venerable sir, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas have split into two factions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They keep arguing, quarreling, &amp; disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth: 'You don't understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, &amp; repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its support [now] broken, without an arbiter."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Ānanda said to Cunda the novice, "Friend Cunda, there is warrant here for talking to the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let's go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, report this matter to him."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, venerable sir," Cunda the novice responded to Ven. Ānanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda &amp; Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One, "Lord, Cunda the novice, here, has said that Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">... Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, &amp; repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its support broken, without an arbiter."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<h4>A Poorly-expounded Dhamma-Vinaya</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with [that] Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with [that] Dhamma, but deviates from it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is to be told, 'It is a gain for you, friend, well-gained by you, that — when your teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened — you are one who does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, but deviates from it.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be criticized, the Dhamma is to be criticized, but the disciple is to be thus praised.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Come, friend, practice in line with the Dhamma as taught and formulated by your teacher':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The person who urged him, the thing urged, and the person who practiced in line with what was urged would all produce much demerit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be criticized, the Dhamma is to be criticized, and the disciple is to be thus criticized.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Yes, friend, practicing the right way, you will succeed in the right way':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The person who praised him, the thing praised, and the person who, being praised, aroused even greater persistence would all produce much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<h4>A Well-expounded Dhamma-Vinaya</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya, is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, but deviates from it.</p>

					<h4>The Complete Holy Life</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher has appeared in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But his disciples have not been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to them, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> well-proclaimed as far as human beings &amp; devas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then their teacher disappears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of regret for his disciples.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'A teacher has appeared in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But we have not been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma, nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to us, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles, well-proclaimed as far as human beings &amp; devas, and now our teacher has disappeared.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of regret for his disciples.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But then there is the case, Cunda, where a teacher has appeared in the world, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of no regret for his disciples.</p>

When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of no regret for his disciples.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, if a holy life is endowed with those factors, yet there is no teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, then a holy life of that sort is incomplete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the qualities I have taught that you should all, having assembled &amp; gathered together, recite &amp; compare meaning with meaning, expression with expression, so that this holy life may long endure &amp; remain steadfast for the benefit, welfare, &amp; happiness of the multitude; out of sympathy for the world; for the benefit, welfare, &amp; happiness of human beings &amp; devas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In them, you should train yourselves harmoniously, cordially, without dispute.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha, and if the thought occurs to you, 'Friends, this venerable one has grasped the wrong meaning and picked up the wrong expression,' you should express neither delight nor scorn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither delighting nor scorning, you should say to him, 'With regard to this meaning, friend, there are these expressions or those expressions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which are the more pertinent?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And with regard to these expressions, there is this meaning or that meaning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which is the more pertinent?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If he should say, 'Friends, with regard to this meaning, these expressions are more pertinent than those; and with regard to these expressions, this meaning is more pertinent than that,' then he is neither to be praised nor disparaged.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither praising nor disparaging him, you should show him how to examine that meaning &amp; those expressions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If another one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha, and if the thought occurs to you, 'Friends, this venerable one has grasped the wrong meaning but picked up the right expression,' you should express neither delight nor scorn.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither delighting nor scorning, you should say to him, 'With regard to these expressions, there is this meaning or that meaning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which is the more pertinent?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If he should say, 'Friends, with regard to these expressions, this meaning is more pertinent than that,' then he is neither to be praised nor disparaged.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Neither praising nor disparaging him, you should show him how to examine that meaning.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If another one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha, and if the thought occurs to you, 'Friends, this venerable one has grasped the right meaning but picked up the wrong expression,' you should express neither delight nor scorn.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If another one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha, and if the thought occurs to you, 'Friends, this venerable one has grasped the right meaning and picked up the right expression,' saying, 'Excellent,' you should express delight &amp; rejoice in his statement.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Expressing delight &amp; rejoicing in his statement, saying, 'Excellent,' you should say to him, 'It's a gain for us, friend, a great gain, that we see a venerable one like you who has entered into the meaning and the expression in this way.'</p>
					
					<h4>The Pleasures of the Holy Life</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"Cunda, I don't teach you the Dhamma only for the restraint of effluents in the present life, nor do I teach you the Dhamma only for the warding off of effluents in the afterlife.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I teach you the Dhamma both for the restraint of effluents in the present life and for the warding off of effluents in the afterlife.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Therefore, the robe I have allowed you is enough simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for the purpose of covering the parts of the body that cause shame.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The alms food I have allowed you is enough simply for the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, thinking, 'Thus will I destroy old feelings (of hunger) and not create new feelings (from overeating).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will maintain myself, be blameless, &amp; live in comfort.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The lodgings I have allowed you are enough simply to counteract cold, to counteract heat, to counteract the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, &amp; reptiles; simply for protection from the inclemencies of weather and for the enjoyment of seclusion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The medicinal requisites used for curing the sick that I have allowed you are enough simply to counteract any pains of illness that have arisen and for maximum freedom from disease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say, 'The Sakyan-son contemplatives live devoted to the devotion to pleasure.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When they are saying that, the wanderers of other sects should be told, 'Which devotion to pleasure, friends?  —  for devotion to pleasure has many modes, many permutations.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are four devotions to pleasure, Cunda, that are base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable, that do not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, or unbinding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a certain fool finds pleasure &amp; rapture for himself in killing living beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where a certain person finds pleasure &amp; rapture for himself in taking what is not given.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where a certain person finds pleasure &amp; rapture for himself in telling lies.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the third devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where a certain person goes about endowed &amp; provided with the five strings of sensuality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fourth devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the four devotions to pleasure, Cunda, that are base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable, that do not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, or unbinding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible that wanderers of other sects might say, 'The Sakyan-son contemplatives live devoted to these four devotions to pleasure.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are to be told, 'Not so!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would not be speaking rightly of you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would be slandering you with what is unfactual &amp; untrue.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are four devotions to pleasure, Cunda, that lead exclusively to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, &amp; unbinding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Further, Cunda, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, the monk enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the second devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Further, Cunda, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He enters &amp; remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' This is the third devotion to pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, Cunda, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — the monk enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fourth devotion to pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the four devotions to pleasure that lead exclusively to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, &amp; unbinding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say, 'The Sakyan-son contemplatives live devoted to these four devotions to pleasure.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are to be told, 'That is so!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would be speaking rightly of you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would not be slandering you with what is unfactual &amp; untrue.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's possible that wanderers of other sects might say, 'Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure, friends, what fruits, what rewards can be expected?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The wanderers of other sects saying that are to be told, 'Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure, friends, four fruits, four rewards can be expected.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Friends, there is the case where a monk, with the wasting away of (the first) three fetters, is a stream-enterer, certain, never again destined for the lower realms, headed for self-awakening.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the first fruit, the first reward.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Further, friends, the monk — with the wasting away of (the first) three fetters, and with the attenuation of passion, aversion, &amp; delusion — is a once-returner; who, on returning only once more to this world, will make an ending to stress.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the second fruit, the second reward.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Further, the monk — with the wasting away of the five lower fetters — is due to arise spontaneously (in the Pure Abodes), there to totally unbind, destined never again to return from that world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the third fruit, the third reward.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Further, the monk — with the ending of effluents — enters &amp; remains in the effluent-free awareness-release &amp; discernment-release, having directly known &amp; realized it for himself right in the here &amp; now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Living devoted to these four devotions to pleasure, friends, these four fruits, these four rewards can be expected.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say, 'The Sakan-son contemplatives live without an established Dhamma.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The wanderers of other sects saying that should be told, 'There are, friends, Dhammas taught &amp; formulated by the Blessed One — the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened — that are not to be transgressed throughout life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just like a gate post or iron post that is deeply buried, well-planted, immovable, unshakable, in the same way there are Dhammas taught &amp; formulated by the Blessed One — the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy, &amp; rightly self-awakened — that are not to be transgressed throughout life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'Friends, an arahant monk whose effluents are ended, who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who is released through right gnosis, cannot possibly transgress nine principles:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'[1] It is impossible for a monk whose effluents are ended to intentionally deprive a living being of life.</p>

					<h4>The Tathāgata's Knowledge &amp; Vision</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that some wanderers of other sects might say, 'Gotama the contemplative describes unlimited knowledge &amp; vision with regard to the past, but doesn't describe unlimited knowledge &amp; vision with regard to the future.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is this?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How is this?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those wanderers of other sects construe the sort of knowing that is not knowledge &amp; vision<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> to be the sort of knowing that is knowledge &amp; vision, just like inexperienced fools.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata's memory-&amp;-recollection knowledge with regard to the past is such that he recollects whatever he wants.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata's knowledge with regard to the future arises born from his awakening:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is the last birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is now no further becoming.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is past:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is unfactual, untrue, &amp; unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, but unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, &amp; beneficial, the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is future...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is present:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is unfactual, untrue, &amp; unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, but unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, &amp; beneficial, the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Thus, Cunda, with regard to things that are past, future, &amp; present, the Tathāgata is one who speaks at the proper time, speaks what is true, speaks what is factual, speaks the meaning, speaks Dhamma, speaks Vinaya.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Cunda, whatever in this world — with its devas, Māras, &amp; Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives &amp; brahmans, its royalty &amp; common people — is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed right self-awakening until the night he totally unbinds in the unbinding property with no fuel remaining,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> whatever the Tathāgata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>[tatha]</i> and not otherwise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata is one who does in line with <i>[tatha]</i> what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In this world with its devas, Māras, &amp; Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives &amp; brahmans, its royalty &amp; common people, the Tathāgata is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This passage appears to be a response to the claims made by Pūraṇa Kassapa and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, who taught two different forms of determinism and who both claimed to have infinite knowledge of the cosmos, a knowledge that included knowledge of the past and future, which in their view was already predetermined (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p38">AN 9:38</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a>). The Buddha, however, rejected determinism (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p63">AN 3:63</a>) and instead taught a doctrine of kamma that allowed for the freedom to choose skillful or unskillful courses of action in the present moment. This meant that his knowledge of the future did not encompass all details about the future, as many of those details were contingent on decisions that had not yet been made. But he did have future knowledge of a more specific and more valuable sort: He knew that he would not be reborn. Regardless of how unlimited Pūraṇa Kassapa and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta might claim their knowledge of the future to be, they did not have this sort of knowledge of their own future at all.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Nevertheless, even though the Buddha did not claim total knowledge of the future, he was able to see tendencies in the present that would bear future fruit. For example, in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_20_opammasamyutta.htm#p7">SN 20:7</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p79">AN 5:79–80</a>, he foresees the decline of the Saṅgha and the disappearance of the True Dhamma, but he warns the monks of these coming dangers, not so that they would accept them as inevitable, but so that they would do what they could to counteract them. This means that the monks would have it in their power to slow these tendencies down. In MN&#160;12, he illustrates his knowledge of the future fate of specific individuals with the analogy of the one-way path <i>(ekāyana-magga):</i> When a man is following a one-way path to that leads only to one specific destination, one would know that he will eventually reach that destination. In the same way, the Buddha can see of specific individuals that as long as they follow specific one-way paths of practice, their practice will eventually lead them to the corresponding goals. This knowledge, of course, is dependent on each individual's continuing to follow that path of practice.</p>

The Commentary is of no help in this regard, as it addresses itself only to some of the more obvious issues in the discussion, and leaves the less obvious ones untouched. Therefore, this translation is tentative, based on the readings that seem best to me, based both on stylistic grounds and on the way they fit in with the discussions of these views in other suttas.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">The term <i>diṭṭhi-nissaya,</i> "view dependency," is also found in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Of the view-dependencies in the following list, the question of whether the self and the world are eternal is treated in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28">DN 28,</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a>, and is mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>; the question of whether the self is self-made, etc., is mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>, as is the question of whether pleasure &amp; pain are eternal; the question of whether pleasure &amp; pain are self-made, etc., is treated in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 12:18</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a>, and mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p95">AN 6:95.</a></p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">The suttas that treat these views, as opposed to those that merely mention them, show how the Buddha would and would not declare them. In all cases, he would not declare them as, "Only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless." He <i>would</i> declare or explain them, however, in the sense of showing either how the view is formulated, how it is grasped, or how grasping to the view gets in the way of reaching the deathless. The discussion in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> is the most complex, as it gives a detailed and different treatment for each of the views it covers. However, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> contains a refrain that treats every view it covers in light of dependent co-arising. This refrain — along with passages from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a> — gives the general thrust of the way in which the Buddha would explain/declare these views.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"When those contemplatives &amp; brahmans assert various types of theories... on 62 grounds, that is an agitation &amp; vacillation to be felt by those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who, not knowing, not seeing, are immersed in craving.... That comes from contact as a requisite condition.... That they would experience that other than through contact: That isn't possible.... They all experience that through repeated contact at the six sense media. For them, from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-&amp;-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"But when a monk discerns the origination, ending, allure, drawbacks of, &amp; emancipation from the six sense media, he discerns what is higher than all of this." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Those contemplatives &amp; brahmans who are of this view, this opinion, 'The self &amp; the cosmos are eternal: Only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless': It is impossible that — apart from conviction, apart from liking, apart from unbroken tradition, apart from reasoning by analogy, apart from an agreement through pondering views [see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p95">MN 95</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p66">AN 3:66</a>] — they would have their very own pure &amp; clear personal knowledge of that. There being no pure &amp; clear personal knowledge, whatever modicum or sliver of knowledge those venerable contemplatives &amp; brahmans clarify on that matter is said to be clinging on their part. With regard to that — fabricated, gross — there is still the cessation of fabrications: There <i>is</i> this.' Knowing that, seeing the escape from it, the Tathāgata has gone beyond it." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Whatever contemplatives &amp; brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure &amp; pain are self-made, even that is dependent on contact. Whatever contemplatives &amp; brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure &amp;amp; pain are other-made... self-made &amp; other-made... without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"It isn't possible that any contemplatives &amp; brahmans — teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure &amp; pain are self-made — would be sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain otherwise than through contact. It isn't possible that any contemplatives &amp; brahmans — teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure &amp; pain are other-made... self-made &amp; other-made... without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen  — would be sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain otherwise than through contact.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"When there is a body, pleasure &amp; pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause; or when there is speech, pleasure &amp; pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause; or when there is intellect, pleasure &amp; pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"From ignorance as a requisite condition, then either of one's own accord one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain arise internally, or because of others one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain arise internally. Either one fabricates alert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain arise internally; or one fabricates unalert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain arise internally. [Similarly with verbal &amp; intellectual fabrications.]</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Now, ignorance is bound up in these things. From the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance, there no longer exists (the sense of) the body on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain internally arise. There no longer exists the speech... the intellect on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain internally arise. There no longer exists the field, the site, the dimension, or the issue on account of which that pleasure &amp; pain internally arise." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> As the discussions of these points in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28">DN 28</a> make clear, there are beings who, even though they can remember past lives, have different memories/perceptions of those lives because of the vagaries of their kamma and the limitations on their memories. Thus they come to different conclusions about where they ultimately came from — and, as is shown in the following section of this sutta, what will become of them after death. The Buddha's larger knowledge of past lives shows that none of the view-dependencies offered here can be the only truth about the past or the future. And some of them are simply not true: As he says in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 12:18</a>, it is definitely not true that pleasure &amp; pain are spontaneously arisen; instead, they are dependently co-arisen. And as for beginning points in general, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_15_anamataggasamyutta.htm#p3">SN 15:3</a> states that transmigration comes from an inconceivable beginning point; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p61">AN 10:61</a> says that a beginning point for ignorance, such that one might say, "Before this, ignorance did not exist; then it came into play," cannot be discerned.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Instead of basing his teachings on perceptions about the past, the Buddha focuses instead on how suffering is maintained — and can be ended — in the immediate present. His formulation of the four noble truths holds true, and is immediately applicable to the problem of suffering and stress here and now, regardless of what one remembers from the past. These truths also serve the purpose of leading to nibbāna, something that none of these other views can do. This is why his criticism of the other views does not apply to right view, and why his doctrine is superior to any of the view-dependencies discussed here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The view-dependencies in the following list, or close variants, are discussed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../">MN 102</a>. The first four are discussed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_24_ditthisamyutta.htm">SN 24.</a> The discussions in both <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a> are quite extended, giving different details for each view, although the refrain in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> is the same here as it is for the view-dependencies dealing with beginning points. A passage from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_24_ditthisamyutta.htm#p37">SN 24:37</a> gives an idea of how it and its companion suttas declare/explain the first four of these views:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Monks, there being what, clinging to what, entrenched in what, does this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease'?" ...</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"There being form, clinging to form, entrenched in form, this view arises: 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease.' There being feeling... There being perception... There being fabrications... There being consciousness, clinging to consciousness, entrenched in consciousness, this view arises: 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease.'</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Now what do you think, monks?</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Inconstant, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Stressful, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And without clinging to what is inconstant, stressful, and subject to change, would this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease'?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"No, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Thus it is that — there being stress, clinging to stress, entrenched in stress — this view arises, 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease.'"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">[Similarly with the remaining aggregates.]</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Now what do you think, monks?</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Is what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect constant or inconstant?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Inconstant, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Stressful, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And without clinging to what is inconstant, stressful, and subject to change, would this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form &amp; free from disease'?"</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"No, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Now, when a disciple of the noble ones has abandoned doubt with regard to these six bases [the five aggregates and what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect], and has abandoned doubt with regard to stress, has abandoned doubt with regard to the origination of stress, has abandoned doubt with regard to the cessation of stress, and has abandoned doubt with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress, then he is a stream-enterer, certain, never again destined for the lower realms, headed for self-awakening."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In addition, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN 2</a> makes clear that the Buddha would avoid answering the question of whether there is a self to begin with.</p>
