					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta had just died in Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas had split into two factions.</p>

					<p class="f4">They kept arguing, quarreling, and disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You don't understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">I understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you understand this Dhamma-Vinaya?</p>

					<p class="f4">You practice wrongly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I practice rightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm consistent.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're inconsistent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What should be said first, you said last.</p>

					<p class="f4">What should be said last, you said first.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your position has been overthrown.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Nothing but slaughter, as it were, was being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seemed disenchanted, disgusted, and repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its foundation [now] broken, without an arbiter.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then Cunda the novice, who had spent the Rains at Pāvā, went to Ven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda at Sāmagāma and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda, "Venerable sir, Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">On his death, the Nigaṇṭhas have split into two factions.</p>

					<p class="f4">They keep arguing, quarreling, and disputing, stabbing one another with weapons of the mouth: 'You don't understand this Dhamma-Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you understand this Dhamma-Vinaya?</p>

					<p class="f4">What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your position has been overthrown.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!' Nothing but slaughter, as it were, is being committed among the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, and repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its support [now] broken, without an arbiter."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Ānanda said to Cunda the novice, "Friend Cunda, there is warrant here for talking to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let's go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, report this matter to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, venerable sir," Cunda the novice responded to Ven. Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda and Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One, "Lord, Cunda the novice, here, has said that Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta has just died in Pāvā.</p>

					<p class="f4">... Even the lay disciples of Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, dressed in white, seem disenchanted, disgusted, and repelled by the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭa-sons, and at how that poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya was poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who was not rightly self-awakened, its support broken, without an arbiter."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<h4>A Poorly-expounded Dhamma-Vinaya</h4>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with [that] Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with [that] Dhamma, but deviates from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is to be told, 'It is a gain for you, friend, well-gained by you, that — when your teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened — you are one who does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, but deviates from it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be criticized, the Dhamma is to be criticized, but the disciple is to be thus praised.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Come, friend, practice in line with the Dhamma as taught and formulated by your teacher':</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who urged him, the thing urged, and the person who practiced in line with what was urged would all produce much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, and acts to conform to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is to be told, 'It is no gain for you, friend, poorly-gained by you, that — when your teacher is not rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya, is poorly proclaimed, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened — you are one who dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with [that] Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with [that] Dhamma, and acts to conform to it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be criticized, the Dhamma is to be criticized, and the disciple is to be thus criticized.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Yes, friend, practicing the right way, you will succeed in the right way':</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who praised him, the thing praised, and the person who, being praised, aroused even greater persistence would all produce much demerit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a poorly proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, poorly expounded, not leading out, not conducive to calming, expounded by one who is not rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<h4>A Well-expounded Dhamma-Vinaya</h4>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya, is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, but deviates from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is to be told, 'It is no gain for you, friend, poorly-gained by you, that — when your teacher is rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened — you are one who does not dwell practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, but deviates from it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be praised, the Dhamma is to be praised, but the disciple is to be thus criticized.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Come, friend, practice in line with the Dhamma as taught and formulated by your teacher':</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who urged him, the thing urged, and the person who practiced in line with what was urged would all produce much merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a well-proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher is rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya, is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple of that Dhamma dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, and acts to conform to it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is to be told, 'It is a gain for you, friend, well-gained by you, that — when your teacher is rightly self-awakened, and his Dhamma-Vinaya is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened — you are one who dwells practicing the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing masterfully, living in line with the Dhamma, and acts to conform to it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There, Cunda, the teacher is to be praised, the Dhamma is to be praised, and the disciple is to be thus praised.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whoever might say to such a disciple, 'Yes, friend, practicing the right way, you will succeed in the right way':</p>

					<p class="f4">The person who praised him, the thing praised, and the person who, being praised, aroused even greater persistence would all produce much merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">That's the way it is, Cunda, with a well-proclaimed Dhamma-Vinaya, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<h4>The Complete Holy Life</h4>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Cunda, where a teacher has appeared in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">But his disciples have not been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to them, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> well-proclaimed as far as human beings and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then their teacher disappears.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of regret for his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A teacher has appeared in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">But we have not been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma, nor has the complete holy life been entirely disclosed to us, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles, well-proclaimed as far as human beings and devas, and now our teacher has disappeared.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of regret for his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But then there is the case, Cunda, where a teacher has appeared in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">His disciples have been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma, and the complete holy life has been entirely disclosed to them, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles, well-proclaimed as far as human beings and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then their teacher disappears.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of no regret for his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A teacher has appeared in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

When a teacher of that sort has died, it is a matter of no regret for his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, if a holy life is endowed with those factors, yet there is no teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, then a holy life of that sort is incomplete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when a holy life is endowed with those factors, and there is a teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, then a holy life of that sort is complete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if a holy life is endowed with those factors, and there is a teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, yet there are no elder monk disciples of his that are experienced, trained, mature, attained to security from the yoke, able to teach the True Dhamma, able to trap with the True Dhamma any opposing doctrines that have arisen and — having trapped them — to teach the Dhamma complete with miracles, then a holy life of that sort is incomplete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when a holy life is endowed with those factors, and there is a teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, and there are elder monk disciples of his who are experienced, trained, mature, attained to security from the yoke, able to teach the True Dhamma, able to trap with the True Dhamma any opposing doctrines that have arisen and — having trapped them — to teach the Dhamma complete with miracles, then a holy life of that sort is complete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">his holy life has become powerful, prosperous, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread, proclaimed among devas and human beings, yet has not attained supremacy in terms of gains and supremacy in terms of status, then a holy life of that sort is incomplete with regard to that factor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when a holy life is endowed with those factors, and there is a teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age, and there are elder monk disciples of his who are experienced, trained, mature, attained to security from the yoke, able to teach the True Dhamma, able to trap with the True Dhamma any opposing doctrines that have arisen and — having trapped them — to teach the Dhamma complete with miracles; and there are monk disciples of his of middle standing; there are junior monk disciples of his; there are elder nun disciples of his... nun disciples of his of middle standing...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, I am now a teacher who has appeared in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, well-expounded, leading out, conducive to calming, expounded by one who is rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">My disciples have been instructed in the meaning/goal of the True Dhamma, and the complete holy life has been entirely disclosed to them, made plain, with all its steps collected, complete with miracles, well-proclaimed as far as human beings and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am now a teacher who is an elder, of long standing, long gone forth, senior, attained to old age.</p>

					<p class="f4">And to the extent that my community or group has appeared in the world, I do not see any other community that has attained supremacy in terms of gains and supremacy in terms of status, equal to what the Saṅgha of monks has.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one speaking rightly were to say, 'a well-expounded, entirely complete, well-proclaimed holy life, consummate in all its aspects, complete in all its aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing in excess,' he would, speaking rightly, say it of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'a well-expounded, entirely complete, well-proclaimed holy life, consummate in all its aspects, complete in all its aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing in excess.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Udaka Rāmaputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> once made this statement: 'Seeing, one doesn't see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is it that, 'seeing, one doesn't see'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One sees the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not the edge of the razor.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Cunda, is called, 'seeing, one doesn't see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But this statement of Uddaka Rāmaputta is base, vulgar, common, ignoble, unprofitable, dealing only with a razor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how would one, speaking rightly, say, 'Seeing, one doesn't see'?</p>

					<p class="f4">One speaking rightly, would say just this:</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is it that, 'seeing, one doesn't see'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a well-expounded, entirely complete, well-proclaimed holy life, consummate in all its aspects, complete in all its aspects, with nothing lacking and nothing in excess:</p>

					<h4>That this Holy Life May Long Endure</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Cunda, with regard to the qualities I have taught, having directly known them, you should all, having assembled and gathered together, recite and compare<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> meaning with meaning, expression with expression, so that this holy life may long endure and remain steadfast for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the multitude; out of sympathy for the world; for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of human beings and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">And which are the qualities I have taught that you should all, having assembled and gathered together, recite and compare meaning with meaning, expression with expression, so that this holy life may long endure and remain steadfast for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the multitude; out of sympathy for the world; for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of human beings and devas?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four establishings of mindfulness,<br />

					<p class="f4">These are the qualities I have taught that you should all, having assembled and gathered together, recite and compare meaning with meaning, expression with expression, so that this holy life may long endure and remain steadfast for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of the multitude; out of sympathy for the world; for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of human beings and devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">In them, you should train yourselves harmoniously, cordially, without dispute.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one of your fellows in the holy life should speak of the Dhamma in the Saṅgha, and if the thought occurs to you, 'Friends, this venerable one has grasped the wrong meaning and picked up the wrong expression,' you should express neither delight nor scorn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither delighting nor scorning, you should say to him, 'With regard to this meaning, friend, there are these expressions or those expressions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which are the more pertinent?</p>

					<p class="f4">And with regard to these expressions, there is this meaning or that meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the more pertinent?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he should say, 'Friends, with regard to this meaning, these expressions are more pertinent than those; and with regard to these expressions, this meaning is more pertinent than that,' then he is neither to be praised nor disparaged.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first devotion to pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, Cunda, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, the monk enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, Cunda, with the fading of rapture, the monk remains equanimous, mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the four devotions to pleasure that lead exclusively to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, calming, direct knowledge, self-awakening, and unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say, 'The Sakan-son contemplatives live without an established Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The wanderers of other sects saying that should be told, 'There are, friends, Dhammas taught and formulated by the Blessed One — the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy, and rightly self-awakened — that are not to be transgressed throughout life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like a gate post or iron post that is deeply buried, well-planted, immovable, unshakable, in the same way there are Dhammas taught and formulated by the Blessed One — the one who knows, the one who sees, worthy, and rightly self-awakened — that are not to be transgressed throughout life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Friends, an arahant monk whose effluents are ended, who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who is released through right gnosis, cannot possibly transgress nine principles:</p>

					<h4>The Tathāgata's Knowledge and Vision</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Now, it's possible, Cunda, that some wanderers of other sects might say, 'Gotama the contemplative describes unlimited knowledge and vision with regard to the past, but doesn't describe unlimited knowledge and vision with regard to the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is this?</p>

					<p class="f4">How is this?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those wanderers of other sects construe the sort of knowing that is not knowledge and vision<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> to be the sort of knowing that is knowledge and vision, just like inexperienced fools.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata's memory-and-recollection knowledge with regard to the past is such that he recollects whatever he wants.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata's knowledge with regard to the future arises born from his awakening:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is now no further becoming.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is past:</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is unfactual, untrue, and unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, but unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, and beneficial, the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is future...</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to what is present:</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is unfactual, untrue, and unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, but unbeneficial, the Tathāgata does not declare it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it is factual, true, and beneficial, the Tathāgata has a sense of the proper time for giving the answer to that question.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Cunda, with regard to things that are past, future, and present, the Tathāgata is one who speaks at the proper time, speaks what is true, speaks what is factual, speaks the meaning, speaks Dhamma, speaks Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, whatever in this world — with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives and brahmans, its royalty and common people — is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed right self-awakening until the night he totally unbinds in the unbinding property with no fuel remaining,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> whatever the Tathāgata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>[tatha]</i> and not otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata is one who does in line with <i>[tatha]</i> what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this world with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives and brahmans, its royalty and common people, the Tathāgata is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Reading <i>añāṇadassanaɱ</i> with the Thai edition. The other editions have <i>ñāṇadassanaɱ,</i> "that is knowledge and vision," which doesn't fit into the general message of the text here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This passage appears to be a response to the claims made by Pūraṇa Kassapa and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta, who taught two different forms of determinism and who both claimed to have infinite knowledge of the cosmos, a knowledge that included knowledge of the past and future, which in their view was already predetermined (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p38">AN 9:38</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a>). The Buddha, however, rejected determinism (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p63">AN 3:63</a>) and instead taught a doctrine of kamma that allowed for the freedom to choose skillful or unskillful courses of action in the present moment. This meant that his knowledge of the future did not encompass all details about the future, as many of those details were contingent on decisions that had not yet been made. But he did have future knowledge of a more specific and more valuable sort: He knew that he would not be reborn. Regardless of how unlimited Pūraṇa Kassapa and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta might claim their knowledge of the future to be, they did not have this sort of knowledge of their own future at all.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Nevertheless, even though the Buddha did not claim total knowledge of the future, he was able to see tendencies in the present that would bear future fruit. For example, in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_20_opammasamyutta.htm#p7">SN 20:7</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p79">AN 5:79–80</a>, he foresees the decline of the Saṅgha and the disappearance of the True Dhamma, but he warns the monks of these coming dangers, not so that they would accept them as inevitable, but so that they would do what they could to counteract them. This means that the monks would have it in their power to slow these tendencies down. In MN&#160;12, he illustrates his knowledge of the future fate of specific individuals with the analogy of the one-way path <i>(ekāyana-magga):</i> When a man is following a one-way path to that leads only to one specific destination, one would know that he will eventually reach that destination. In the same way, the Buddha can see of specific individuals that as long as they follow specific one-way paths of practice, their practice will eventually lead them to the corresponding goals. This knowledge, of course, is dependent on each individual's continuing to follow that path of practice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The refrains that frame the following discussion on view-dependencies contain many variant readings, and unfortunately none of the printed editions sorts out the variants especially well. The Commentary is of no help in this regard, as it addresses itself only to some of the more obvious issues in the discussion, and leaves the less obvious ones untouched. Therefore, this translation is tentative, based on the readings that seem best to me, based both on stylistic grounds and on the way they fit in with the discussions of these views in other suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The term <i>diṭṭhi-nissaya,</i> "view dependency," is also found in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Of the view-dependencies in the following list, the question of whether the self and the world are eternal is treated in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28">DN 28,</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a>, and is mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>; the question of whether the self is self-made, etc., is mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p55">Ud 6:5</a>, as is the question of whether pleasure and pain are eternal; the question of whether pleasure and pain are self-made, etc., is treated in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 12:18</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a>, and mentioned in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p95">AN 6:95.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">The suttas that treat these views, as opposed to those that merely mention them, show how the Buddha would and would not declare them. In all cases, he would not declare them as, "Only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless." He <i>would</i> declare or explain them, however, in the sense of showing either how the view is formulated, how it is grasped, or how grasping to the view gets in the way of reaching the deathless. The discussion in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> is the most complex, as it gives a detailed and different treatment for each of the views it covers. However, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> contains a refrain that treats every view it covers in light of dependent co-arising. This refrain — along with passages from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a> — gives the general thrust of the way in which the Buddha would explain/declare these views.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"When those contemplatives and brahmans assert various types of theories... on 62 grounds, that is an agitation and vacillation to be felt by those contemplatives and brahmans who, not knowing, not seeing, are immersed in craving.... That comes from contact as a requisite condition.... That they would experience that other than through contact: That isn't possible.... They all experience that through repeated contact at the six sense media. For them, from feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"But when a monk discerns the origination, ending, allure, drawbacks of, and emancipation from the six sense media, he discerns what is higher than all of this." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Those contemplatives and brahmans who are of this view, this opinion, 'The self and the cosmos are eternal: Only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless': It is impossible that — apart from conviction, apart from liking, apart from unbroken tradition, apart from reasoning by analogy, apart from an agreement through pondering views [see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p95">MN 95</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p66">AN 3:66</a>] — they would have their very own pure and clear personal knowledge of that. There being no pure and clear personal knowledge, whatever modicum or sliver of knowledge those venerable contemplatives and brahmans clarify on that matter is said to be clinging on their part. With regard to that — fabricated, gross — there is still the cessation of fabrications: There <i>is</i> this.' Knowing that, seeing the escape from it, the Tathāgata has gone beyond it." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made, even that is dependent on contact. Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure andamp; pain are other-made... self-made and other-made... without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen, even that is dependent on contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"It isn't possible that any contemplatives and brahmans — teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made — would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact. It isn't possible that any contemplatives and brahmans — teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure and pain are other-made... self-made and other-made... without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen  — would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"When there is a body, pleasure and pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause; or when there is speech, pleasure and pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause; or when there is intellect, pleasure and pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the cause.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"From ignorance as a requisite condition, then either of one's own accord one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally, or because of others one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally. Either one fabricates alert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally; or one fabricates unalert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally. [Similarly with verbal and intellectual fabrications.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Now, ignorance is bound up in these things. From the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance, there no longer exists (the sense of) the body on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise. There no longer exists the speech... the intellect on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise. There no longer exists the field, the site, the dimension, or the issue on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise." <i> —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p25">SN 12:25</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> As the discussions of these points in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p28">DN 28</a> make clear, there are beings who, even though they can remember past lives, have different memories/perceptions of those lives because of the vagaries of their kamma and the limitations on their memories. Thus they come to different conclusions about where they ultimately came from — and, as is shown in the following section of this sutta, what will become of them after death. The Buddha's larger knowledge of past lives shows that none of the view-dependencies offered here can be the only truth about the past or the future. And some of them are simply not true: As he says in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p18">SN 12:18</a>, it is definitely not true that pleasure and pain are spontaneously arisen; instead, they are dependently co-arisen. And as for beginning points in general, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_15_anamataggasamyutta.htm#p3">SN 15:3</a> states that transmigration comes from an inconceivable beginning point; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p61">AN 10:61</a> says that a beginning point for ignorance, such that one might say, "Before this, ignorance did not exist; then it came into play," cannot be discerned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Instead of basing his teachings on perceptions about the past, the Buddha focuses instead on how suffering is maintained — and can be ended — in the immediate present. His formulation of the four noble truths holds true, and is immediately applicable to the problem of suffering and stress here and now, regardless of what one remembers from the past. These truths also serve the purpose of leading to nibbāna, something that none of these other views can do. This is why his criticism of the other views does not apply to right view, and why his doctrine is superior to any of the view-dependencies discussed here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The view-dependencies in the following list, or close variants, are discussed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../">MN 102</a>. The first four are discussed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_24_ditthisamyutta.htm">SN 24.</a> The discussions in both <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a> are quite extended, giving different details for each view, although the refrain in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> is the same here as it is for the view-dependencies dealing with beginning points. A passage from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_24_ditthisamyutta.htm#p37">SN 24:37</a> gives an idea of how it and its companion suttas declare/explain the first four of these views:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Monks, there being what, clinging to what, entrenched in what, does this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease'?" ...</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"There being form, clinging to form, entrenched in form, this view arises: 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease.' There being feeling... There being perception... There being fabrications... There being consciousness, clinging to consciousness, entrenched in consciousness, this view arises: 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Now what do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"And without clinging to what is inconstant, stressful, and subject to change, would this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease'?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Thus it is that — there being stress, clinging to stress, entrenched in stress — this view arises, 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease.'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">[Similarly with the remaining aggregates.]</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Now what do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Is what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"And without clinging to what is inconstant, stressful, and subject to change, would this view arise: 'After death, the self is possessed of form and free from disease'?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Now, when a disciple of the noble ones has abandoned doubt with regard to these six bases [the five aggregates and what is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect], and has abandoned doubt with regard to stress, has abandoned doubt with regard to the origination of stress, has abandoned doubt with regard to the cessation of stress, and has abandoned doubt with regard to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress, then he is a stream-enterer, certain, never again destined for the lower realms, headed for self-awakening."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In addition, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN 2</a> makes clear that the Buddha would avoid answering the question of whether there is a self to begin with.</p>
