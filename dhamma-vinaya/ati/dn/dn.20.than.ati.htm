					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>This discourse is an interesting example of the folklore of the Pali Canon. It shows that the tendency of Asian popular Buddhism to regard the Buddha as a protective figure, and not just as a teacher, has its roots in the earliest part of the tradition. Metrical analysis indicates that the long "tribute" section of this discourse is very old, while the verses in the introductory section — which is also found in the Samyutta Nikaya — are later in form. This fits with a more subjective judgment: that the tribute was an earlier composition — in the honorific style of the ancient court bards — to which the introduction was added later. This judgment is based on the fact that the two sections do not quite fit each other. The introduction to the tribute indicates that the reciter of the tribute is the Buddha himself, whereas the narration in the tribute indicates otherwise.</p>

					<p>At any rate, this discourse is the closest thing in the Pali Canon to a "who's who" of the deva worlds, and should provide useful material for anyone interested in the cosmology of early Buddhism.</p>

					<p>The Commentary reports the belief that the devas enjoy hearing this discourse chanted in Pali. Until recently it was part of many monks' standard memorized repertoire, to be chanted at weddings and the dedication of new buildings. Even today, as many of the traditions of memorization in Asia seem to be falling by the wayside, there are a few monks and laypeople who chant this discourse regularly.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/dn/dn.20.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/dn/dn.20.rhyt.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>][<a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/dn/dn.20.piya.ati.htm#p1">piya</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the <a id="Sakyan">Sakyans</a> at <a id="Kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a> in the Great Wood, together with a large Saŋgha of approximately five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems had gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Saŋgha. Then the thought occurred to four devatās of the ranks from the Pure Abodes: "The Blessed One is dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Great Wood, together with a large Saŋgha of about five hundred bhikkhus, all of them arahants. And most of the devatās from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Blessed One and the Bhikkhu Saŋgha. Let us also approach the Blessed One and, on arrival, let us each speak a verse in his presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, <a id="strongman">just as</a> a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, those devatās disappeared from among the devas of the Pure Abodes and reappeared before the Blessed One. Having paid homage to the Blessed One, they stood to one side. As they were standing there, one devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">A great meeting in the woods:<br />
					The deva hosts have assembled.<br />
					We have come to this Dhamma meeting<br />
					To see the invincible Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">The bhikkhus there are concentrated,<br />
					Have straightened their own minds.<br />
					Like a charioteer holding the reins,<br />
					The wise ones guard their faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Having cut through barrenness, cut the cross-bar,<br />
					Having uprooted <a id="indra">Indra</a>'s pillar, unstirred,<br />
					They wander about pure, unstained,<br />
					Young nagas well tamed by the One with Vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then another devatā recited this verse in the Blessed One's presence:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Those who have gone to the Buddha for refuge<br />
					Will not go to the plane of woe.<br />
					On discarding the human body,<br />
					They will fill the hosts of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks, most of the devatās from ten world-systems have gathered in order to see the Tathāgata and the Bhikkhu Saŋgha. Those who, in the past, were Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, at most had their devatā-gathering like mine at the present. Those who, in the future, will be Pure Ones, Rightly Self-awakened, will at most have their devatā-gathering like mine at the present. I will detail for you the names of the deva hosts. I will describe to you the names of the deva hosts. I will teach you the names of the deva hosts. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks replied. The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">I recite a verse of tribute.<br />
					Those who live where spirits dwell,<br />
					who live in mountain caves,<br />
					resolute, concentrated,<br />
					many, like hidden lions,<br />
					who have overcome horripilation,<br />
					white-hearted, pure,<br />
					serene, and undisturbed:<br />
					Knowing that more than 500 of them<br />
					had come to the forest of Kapilavatthu,<br />
					the Teacher then said to them,<br />
					disciples delighting in his instruction,<br />
					"The deva hosts have approached.<br />
					Detect them, monks!"<br />
					Listening to the Awakened One's instruction,<br />
					they made a diligent effort.<br />

					Some saw 100, some 1,000, some 70,000,<br />
					some had vision of 100,000 non-human beings.<br />
					Some gained vision of innumerable devas<br />
					filling every direction.<br />
					Realizing all this,<br />
					the One-with-Vision felt moved to speak.<br />
