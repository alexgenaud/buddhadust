					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p><i>This is one of the most profound discourses in the Pali Canon. It gives an extended treatment of the teachings of dependent co-arising</i> (paṭicca samuppāda) <i>and not-self</i> (anattā) <i>in an outlined context of how these teachings function in practice.</i></p>

					<p><i>The first part of the discourse takes the factors of dependent co-arising in sequence from effect to cause, tracing them down to the mutual dependency of name-and-form (mental and physical activity) on the one hand, and consciousness on the other. In connection with this point, it is worth noting that the word "great" in the title of the discourse may have a double meaning: modifying the word "discourse" — it's a long discourse — and modifying "causes," referring to the fact that name-and-form and consciousness as causal factors can account for everything describable in the cosmos.</i></p>

					<p><i>After tracing the basic sequence of factors in the causal pattern, the discourse then reviews their inter-relationships, showing how they can explain stress and suffering both on the individual and on the social level.</i></p>

					<p><i>The second part of the discourse, taking up the teaching of not-self, shows how dependent co-arising gives focus to this teaching in practice. It begins with a section on Delineations of a Self, classifying the various ways in which a sense of "self" might be defined in terms of form. The scheme of analysis introduced in this section — classifying views of the self according to the variables of form and formless; finite and infinite; already existing, naturally developing in the future, and alterable through human effort — covers all the theories of the self proposed in the classical Upaniṣads, as well as all theories of self or soul proposed in more recent times. The inclusion of an infinite self in this list gives the lie to the belief that the Buddha's teachings on not-self were denying nothing more than a sense of "separate" or "limited" self. The discourse points out that even a limitless, infinite, all-embracing sense of self is based on an underlying tendency in the mind that has to be abandoned.</i></p>

					<p><i>The following section, on Non-delineations of a Self, shows that it is possible for the mind to function without reading a "self" into experience. The remaining sections focus on ways in which this can be done by treating the sense of self as it relates to different aspects of name-and-form. The first of these sections — Assumptions of a Self — focuses on the sense of self as it relates to feeling, one of the "name" factors in name-and-form. The next section — Seven Stations of Consciousness — focuses on form, formlessness, and perception, which is another one of the "name" factors that allows a place for consciousness to land and grow on the "macro" level in the cycle of death and rebirth. The last section — Eight Emancipations — focuses on form, formlessness, and perception on the "micro" level in the practice of meditative absorption (jhāna).</i></p>

					<p><i>In each of these cases, once the sense of attachment and identification with name-and-form can be broken, the mutual dependency between consciousness and name-and-form is broken as well. This brings about total freedom from the limits of "the extent to which there are means of designation, expression, and delineation... the extent to which the dimension of discernment extends, the extent to which the cycle revolves for the manifesting (discernibility) of this world — i.e., name-and-form together with consciousness." This is the release at which the Buddha's teachings are aimed.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now, the Kurus have a town named Kammāsadhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't say that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, and bad destinations.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does consciousness come?' one should say, 'Consciousness comes from name-and-form as its requisite condition.'</p>

This understanding of the non-self teaching has partial support in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p22">MN 22</a> — which subjects the idea of a universal self to specific ridicule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Other scholars take an opposite tack, saying that the Buddha was refuting the existence of a perduring individual self, but not the existence of a universal or inter-connected self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Neither position does justice to the wide variety of self doctrines that the Buddha rejects in this passage — whether finite or infinite (or endless — <i>ananta);</i> whether possessed of form or formless — for the act of holding to any of these doctrines involves clinging, and thus suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The first position, in particular, also fails to take into account two aspects of the Buddha's actual historical context:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">a) The Upaniṣadic tradition was not the only tradition at the Buddha's time espousing doctrines of the self. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a> cites — and refutes — the self-doctrines of other, non-Vedic schools of the time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">b) No single self-doctrine can claim to be "the" Upaniṣadic doctrine of the self. The Upaniṣads were a diverse body of texts, offering a wide variety of teachings on the topic. Some, such as the Bṛhad-āraṇyaka Upaniṣad and Kaṭha Upaniṣad, state explicitly that each person has two selves, finite and infinite; and the major Upaniṣads differ on the nature of these two selves and how the infinite self can be attained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In fact, it is instructive to classify the various Upaniṣadic self-doctrines in light of the twelve categories listed in this passage. A survey of the major Upaniṣads reveals self-doctrines falling into eight — and perhaps nine — of these categories, as follows: (Passage numbers are taken from S. Radhakrishnan, <i>The Principal Upaniṣads.</i> London: George Allen and Unwin, 1969.)</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">1) Already possessed of form and finite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka II.5.1</i><br />
									<i>Maitrī VI.11</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">2) Naturally becoming possessed of form and finite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka IV.3.19-21</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">3) Can be made possessed of form and finite:</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">—</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">4) Already possessed of form and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka I.4.7-10</i><br />
									<i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka I.5.20</i><br />
									<i>Chāndogya III.14.2-3</i><br />
									<i>Muṇḍaka III.1.7</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">5) Naturally becoming possessed of form and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Chāndogya VIII.3.4</i><br />
									<i>Chāndogya VIII.12.2-3</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">6) Can be made possessed of form and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Praśna IV.6-11</i><br />
									<i>Subāla III</i><br />
									<i>Kaivalya VI</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">7) Already formless and finite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Kaṭha I.3.1-4</i> (? — the description here suggests, but does not explicitly state, that the self is formless)</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">8) Naturally becoming formless and finite:</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">—</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">9) Can be made formless and finite:</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">10) Already formless and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Bṛhad-āraṇyaka III.8.8-11</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">11) Naturally becoming formless and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Praśna IV.6-11</i></p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">12) Can be made formless and infinite:</p>

							      <p class="f3 in4"><i>Kaṭha I.3.13-15</i><br />
									<i>Subāla III</i><br />
									<i>Subāla IX.15</i><br />
									<i>Paiṅgala III.6</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is no way of knowing if these Upaniṣads, as we have them, were composed before or after the Buddha's time. Thus, the classifications here may or may not have been formulated in response to them. Nevertheless, the sheer variety of their teachings shows that there was no single Upaniṣadic doctrine of the self, and that the Buddha did not formulate his not-self teaching in response to only one doctrine. As the framework here shows, the not-self teaching was formulated in such a way as to counteract the act of clinging to any self-doctrine, regardless of how the self might be defined.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The relationship between the limitations of language and the question of the existence of the Tathāgata after death is indicated by <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_23_radhasamyutta.htm#p2">SN 23:2</a>. There the Buddha notes that one defines oneself as a being through passion and delight for any of the five aggregates. Once there is no passion or delight for the aggregates, one can no longer be defined as a being. Once one is no longer defined, there is no way of describing one as existing, not existing, neither, or both — regardless of whether one is alive or dead (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p85">SN 22:85–86</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The various readings for this sentence all seem corrupt. The sense of the paragraph, read in light of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p96">AN 10:96</a>, demands that the view expressed in the last sentence be <i>about</i> the monk released, unlike the four earlier views, which are wrongly <i>attributed to</i> the monk released. In other words, the monk released has no opinion on the question of whether the Tathāgata does, doesn't, etc., exist after death. This might lead to the supposition that his lack of opinion comes from a lack of knowledge or vision. The description of what he comes to know in the course of gaining release shows that this supposition is inappropriate. He does know, he does see, and what he knows and sees about the limitations of language and concepts shows him that the question of the existence of the Tathāgata after death should be set aside.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Thus I would reconstruct the Pali of the final sentence in this paragraph as: <i>Tadabhiññā vimutto bhikkhu na jānāti nā passati iti sā diṭṭhi tadakallaṁ.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p137">MN 137</a> indicates that perceptions of multiplicity deal with the six senses, whereas perceptions of singularity form the basis of the four formless attainments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This last phrase — "and (some) beings in the four realms of deprivation" is in the Thai edition of the Canon, but not in the PTS or Burmese editions. It seems required by the context in order to cover the beings in the lower realms not included in the first station of consciousness.</p>
