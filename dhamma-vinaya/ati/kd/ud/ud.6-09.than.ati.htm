Now on that occasion the Blessed One was sitting out in the open in the pitch black of the night, while oil lamps were burning. Many flying insects were meeting their downfall and misfortune in those oil lamps. The Blessed One saw those flying insects meeting their downfall and misfortune in those oil lamps.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="insects">Rushing headlong</a>, missing what's essential,<br />
					bringing on one new bond<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after another,<br />
					like insects falling into the flame,<br />
					some are intent only on what's seen and heard.</p>
