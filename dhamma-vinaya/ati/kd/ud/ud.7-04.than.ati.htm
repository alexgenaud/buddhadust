Now at that time, most of the people in Sāvatthi were excessively attached to sensuality. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensuality. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthi for alms. He saw that most of the people in Sāvatthi were excessively attached to sensuality, that they live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="fish">Blinded</a> by sensuality<br />
					covered by the net,<br />
					veiled with the veil of craving,<br />
					bound by the bond of heedlessness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like fish in the mouth of a trap,<br />
					they go to aging and death,<br />
					like a suckling calf to its mother.</p>
