Now at that time Ven. Mahā Kaccāyana was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within. The Blessed One saw Ven. Mahā Kaccāyana sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect, having mindfulness immersed in the body well-established to the fore within.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">If one were to have<br />
							mindfulness always<br />
							established, continually<br />
							immersed in the body,<br />
							(thinking,)<br />
							"It should not be,<br />
							it should not be mine;<br />
							it will not be,<br />
							it will not be mine"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
							there,<br />
							in that step-by-step dwelling,<br />
							one in no long time<br />
							would cross over<br />
							attachment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This passage can also be translated as:</p>

					<p class="in4">It should not be,<br />
					it should not occur to me;<br />
					it will not be,<br />
					it will not occur to me.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In <a href="../../an/10_tens/an10.029.than.ati.htm">AN 10.29</a>, the Buddha recommends this view as conducive to developing dispassion for becoming. However, in <a href="../../mn/mn.106.than.ati.htm">MN 106</a> he warns that it can lead to the refined equanimity of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, which can become an object of clinging. Only if that subtle clinging is detected can all clinging be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Canon's most extended discussion of this theme of meditation is in <a href="../../sn/03_kv/sn03.22.055.than.ati.htm">SN 22.55</a>. See Appendix Two [of the print edition of this book].</p>
