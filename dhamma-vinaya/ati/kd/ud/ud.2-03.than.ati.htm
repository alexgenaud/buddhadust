Now at that time, a large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthi and Jeta's Grove were hitting a snake with a stick. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthi for alms. He saw the large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthi and Jeta's Grove hitting the snake with a stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever takes a stick<br />
					to beings desiring ease,<br />
					when he himself is looking for ease,<br />
					will meet with no ease after death.<br /></p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever doesn't take a stick<br />
					to beings desiring ease,<br />
					when he himself is looking for ease,<br />
					will meet with ease after death.</p>
