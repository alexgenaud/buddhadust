					<h1>About Dabba Mallaputta (2)</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the Pali by Thanissaro Bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="VIII-10.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#VIII-10.1">VIII-10.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="sav">Sāvatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="ana">Anāthapiṇḍika's</a> monastery. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "When <a id="dabba">Dabba Mallaputta</a> rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned. <a id="burning">Just as</a> when ghee or oil is burned and consumed, neither ashes nor soot can be discerned, in the same way, when Dabba Mallaputta rose up into the air and, sitting cross-legged in the sky, in space, entered the fire property and then emerged from it and was totally unbound, his body burned and was consumed so that neither ashes nor soot could be discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="fire">Just as</a> the destination of a glowing fire<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struck with a [blacksmith's] iron hammer,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gradually growing calm,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not known:<br /></p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, there's no destination to describe<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for those who are rightly released<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- having crossed over the flood<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of sensuality's bond -- <br />
					for those who have attained<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unwavering bliss.</p>
