Now at that time <a id="kassapa">Ven. Maha Kassapa</a> was staying at the <a id="pipphali">Pipphali Cave</a>, afflicted, in pain, and seriously ill. Then, at a later time, he recovered from his illness. When he had recovered from the illness, the thought occurred to him: "What if I were to go into Rājagaha for alms?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time 500 devatās were eager for the chance to give alms to Ven. Maha Kassapa. But Ven. Maha Kassapa, turning down those 500 devatās, early in the morning put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers. The Blessed One saw that Ven. Maha Kassapa had gone into Rājagaha for alms along the streets of the poor, the streets of the indigent, the streets of the weavers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Maintaining no others,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknown,<br />
					trained, established<br />
					in what is essential,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a brahman.</p>
