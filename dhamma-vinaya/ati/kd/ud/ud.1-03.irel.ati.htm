At one time the Lord was staying at Uruvela... for seven days experiencing the bliss of liberation. Then, at the end of those seven days, the Lord... gave well-reasoned attention during the last watch of the night to dependent arising in both forward and reverse order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">This being, that is;<br />
					from the arising of this, that arises;<br />
					this not being, that is not;<br />
					from the cessation of this, that ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is: with ignorance as condition, volitional activities come to be; ... with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be. This is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">But from the complete disappearance and cessation of ignorance, volitional activities cease; ... from the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. This is the ceasing of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing its significance, the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>When things become manifest<br />
							To the ardent meditating brahman,<br />
							He abides scattering Mara's host<br />
							Like the sun illumining the sky.</i></p>
