					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="III-9.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#III-9.1">III-9.1</a>]</span>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together at a pavilion when this discussion arose: "Who, friends, knows a craft? Who's studying which craft? Which is the supreme among crafts?"</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to that, some said, "The elephant-craft is the supreme craft among crafts." Some said, "The horse-craft is the supreme craft among crafts" ... "The chariot-craft..." ... "Archery..." ... "Swordsmanship..." ... "Signaling<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> ..." ... "Calculating..." ... "Accounting..." ... "Writing..." ... "Literary composition..." ... "Cosmology..." Some said, "Geomancy is the supreme craft among crafts." And this discussion came to no conclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the pavilion and, on arrival, sat down on a seat laid out. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic are you sitting together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we were sitting gathered together here at the pavilion when this discussion arose: [They repeat what had been said.]"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It isn't proper, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or noble silence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Supporting himself
							without a craft &mdash;
							light, desiring the goal &mdash;
							his faculties controlled,
							released		everywhere;
							living in no home,
							unpossessive,
							free from longing,
							having slain Māra,
							going alone
								: a monk.</p>
