At that time <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <a id="bhaddiya">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</a> with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw that Ven. Sāriputta was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf with Dhamma-talk to an even greater extent, as he thought that Bhaddiya was still just a learner.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">He has broken the cycle,<br />
					attained freedom from desire.<br />
					The dried-up stream<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer flows.<br />
					The cycle, broken,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no longer turns.<br />
					This, just this,<br />
					is the end of stress.</p>
