					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="II-10.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#II-10.1">II-10.1</a>][<a href="ud.2-10.than.ati.htm">than</a>]</span> Thus have I heard. At one time the Lord was staying at Anupiya in the Mango Orchard. At that time the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, on going into the forest to the foot of a tree or to an empty place, constantly uttered, "Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!"</p>

					<p class="f4">A number of bhikkhus heard the Venerable Bhaddiya... constantly uttering, "Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!" and the thought came to them: "No doubt, friend, the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, is dissatisfied with leading the holy life, since formerly when he was a householder he enjoyed the bliss of royalty. And when recollecting that, on going into the forest... he utters, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Lord, prostrated themselves, sat down to one side, and reported this to the Lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Lord addressed a certain bhikkhu: "Come, bhikkhu, in my name tell the bhikkhu Bhaddiya, 'The Teacher calls you, friend Bhaddiya.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, revered sir," the bhikkhu replied and approaching the Venerable Bhaddiya, Kaligodha's son, he said, "The Teacher calls you, friend Bhaddiya."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, friend," the Venerable Bhaddiya replied, and approaching the Lord he prostrated himself and sat down to one side. The Lord then said to him: "Is it true, Bhaddiya, that on going into the forest... you utter, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, revered sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Bhaddiya, what do you see that prompts you to do so?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Formerly, revered sir, when I was a householder and enjoyed the bliss of royalty, inside and outside my inner apartments guards were appointed; inside and outside the city guards were appointed; inside and outside the district guards were appointed. But, revered sir, although I was thus guarded and protected, I lived fearful, agitated, distrustful, and afraid. But now, revered sir, on going alone into the forest, to the foot of a tree or to an empty place, I am fearless, unagitated, confident, and unafraid. I live unsense of compunctioned, unruffled, my needs satisfied, with a mind become like a deer's. Seeing this, revered sir, prompts me, on going to the forest... to utter constantly, 'Ah, what bliss! Ah, what bliss!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing its significance, the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>In whom exist no inner stirrings,<br />
							Having passed beyond being this or that,<br />
							Free from fear, blissful and sorrowless,<br />
							The devas are not capable of seeing him.</i></p>
