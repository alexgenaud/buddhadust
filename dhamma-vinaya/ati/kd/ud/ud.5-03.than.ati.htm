					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="V-3.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#V-3.1">V-3.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time in Rājagaha there was a leper named <a id="suppaBuddha">SuppaBuddha</a>, a poor, miserable wretch of a person. And at that time the Blessed One was sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. SuppaBuddha the leper saw the large gathering of people from afar and thought to himself, "Without a doubt, someone must be distributing staple or non-staple food over there. Why don't I go over to that large group of people, and maybe I'll get some staple or non-staple food." So he went over to the large group of people. Then he saw the Blessed One sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. On seeing this, he realized, "There's no one distributing staple or non-staple food over here. That's Gotama the contemplative, sitting surrounded by a large assembly, teaching the Dhamma. Why don't I listen to the Dhamma?" So he sat to one side right there, [thinking,] "I, too, will listen to the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness, asked himself, "Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma?" He saw SuppaBuddha the leper sitting in the assembly, and on seeing him the thought occurred to him, "This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma." So, aiming at SuppaBuddha the leper, <a id="gradual">he gave</a> a step-by-step talk, i.e., a talk on giving, a talk on virtue, a talk on heaven; he declared the drawbacks, degradation, and corruption of sensual passions, and the rewards of renunciation. Then when he saw that SuppaBuddha the leper's mind was ready, malleable, free from hindrances, elated, and bright, he then gave the Dhamma-talk peculiar to Awakened Ones, i.e., stress, origination, cessation, and path. <a id="cloth">And just</a> as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb a dye, in the same way, as SuppaBuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat, the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye arose within him, "Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation."</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen the Dhamma, reached the Dhamma, known the Dhamma, having plunged entirely into the Dhamma, having crossed over and beyond doubt, having had no more perplexity, having gained fearlessness and independence from others with regard to the Teacher's message, he rose up from his seat and went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if the Blessed One were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or were to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One -- through many lines of reasoning -- made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then SuppaBuddha the leper, having been instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by the Blessed One's Dhamma talk, delighting and approving of the Blessed One's words, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circumambulated him -- keeping him to his right -- and left. Not long after his departure he was attacked and <a id="cow">killed</a> by a cow with a young calf.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, "Lord, the leper named SuppaBuddha, whom the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged with a Dhamma talk, has died. What is his destination? What is his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="stream">Monks</a>, SuppaBuddha the leper was wise. He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma. With the destruction of the first three fetters, he is a stream-winner, not subject to states of deprivation, headed for self-awakening for sure."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, one of the monks said to the Blessed One, "Lord, what was the cause, what was the reason, why SuppaBuddha the leper was such a poor, miserable wretch of a person?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once, monks, in this very Rājagaha, SuppaBuddha the leper was the son of a rich money-lender. While being escorted to a pleasure park, he saw <a id="tag">Tagarasikhi</a> the Private Buddha going for alms in the city. On seeing him, he thought, 'Who is this leper prowling about?' Spitting and disrespectfully turning his left side to Tagarasikhi the Private Buddha, he left. As a result of that deed he boiled in hell for many years, many hundreds of years, many thousands of years, many hundreds of thousands of years. And then as a result of that deed he became a poor, miserable wretch of a person in this very Rājagaha. But on encountering the Dhamma and Discipline made known by the Tathāgata, he acquired conviction, virtue, learning, relinquishment, and discernment. Having acquired conviction, virtue, learning, relinquishment, and discernment on encountering the Dhamma and Discipline made known by the Tathāgata, now -- on the break-up of the body, after death -- he has reappeared in a good destination, the heavenly world, in company with the devas of the heaven of the Thirty-three. There he outshines the other devas both in beauty and in glory."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">A person with good eyes,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encountering<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a treacherous, uneven place,<br />
					would try hard to avoid it.<br />
					A wise person, in the world of life,<br />
					should avoid<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil deeds.</p>
