					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="V-8.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#V-8.1">V-8.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Rājagaha at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' refuge. And on that occasion, early in the morning of the uposatha, Ven. &#256;nanda adjusted his under robe and — carrying his bowl and robes — went into Rājagaha for alms. Devadatta saw Ven. &#256;nanda going for alms in Rājagaha and, on seeing him, went to him. On arrival, he said to him, "From this day forward, friend &#256;nanda, I will conduct the uposatha and community transactions apart from the Blessed One, apart from the community of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. &#256;nanda — having gone for alms in Rājagaha, after the meal, returning from his alms round — went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Just now, lord, after adjusting my under robe early in the morning and carrying my bowl and robes, I went into Rājagaha for alms. Devadatta saw me going for alms in Rājagaha and, on seeing me, went up to me. On arrival, he said to me, 'From this day forward, friend &#256;nanda, I will conduct the uposatha and community transactions apart from the Blessed One, apart from the community of monks.' Lord, today Devadatta will split the community. He will conduct the uposatha and community transactions [apart from the community]."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">The good, for the good, is easy to do.<br />
							The good, for the evil, is hard to do.<br />
							Evil, for the evil, is easy to do.<br />
							Evil, for the noble ones, is hard to do.</p>
