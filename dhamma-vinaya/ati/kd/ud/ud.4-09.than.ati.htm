					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="IV-9.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#IV-9.1">IV-9.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time, when <a id="upasena">Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta</a> was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in his awareness: "What a gain, what a true gain it is for me that my teacher is the Blessed One, worthy and fully self-awakened; that I have gone forth from home to the homeless life in a well-taught Dhamma and discipline; that my companions in the holy life are virtuous and endowed with admirable qualities; that I have achieved culmination in terms of the precepts; that my mind is unified and well-concentrated; that I am an arahant, with effluents ended; that I have great power and great might. Fortunate has been my life; fortunate will be my death."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, comprehending with his awareness the line of thinking that had arisen in Ven. Upasena Vangantaputta's awareness, on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels no regret at what life has been,<br />
					he feels no sorrow at death,<br />
					if -- a wise one -- he has seen that state.<br />
					He feels no sorrow<br />
					in the midst of sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who has destroyed<br />
					craving for becoming -- <br />
					the monk of peaceful mind -- <br />
					birth and the wandering on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are totally ended.<br />
					There is no further becoming.</p>
