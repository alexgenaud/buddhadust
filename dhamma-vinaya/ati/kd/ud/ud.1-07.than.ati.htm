					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="I-7.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#I-7.1">I-7.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Pāva at the Ajakalāpaka [Herd-of-Goats] shrine, the dwelling of the Ajakalāpaka spirit. And on that occasion, in the pitch-black darkness of the night, the Blessed One was sitting in the open air, and the rain was falling in scattered drops.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Ajakalāpaka spirit — wanting to cause fear, terror, and horripilation in the Blessed One — went to him and, on arrival, not far from him, three times made a commotion and pandemonium: "Commotion and pandemonium! Commotion and pandemonium! Commotion and pandemonium! — That's a goblin for you, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When,<br />
							with regard to his own qualities,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							a brahman is one<br />
							who has gone beyond,<br />
							he transcends this goblin<br />
							and his pandemonium.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dhammas.</i>This is apparently a reference to skillful and unskillful qualities — which would mean that this sutta sides with the passages in the Canon categorizing unbinding not as a dhamma, but as the transcending of all dhammas. (The suttas in general are inconsistent on this point. Iti 90, among others, states clearly that unbinding counts as a dhamma. <a href="../../an/10_tens/an10.058.than.ati.htm">AN 10.58</a>, on the other hand, calls unbinding the ending of all dhammas. <a href="../snp/snp.5-06.than.ati.htm">Sn 5.6</a> calls the attainment of the goal the transcending of all dhammas, just as <a href="../snp/snp.4-06.than.ati.htm">Sn 4.6</a> and <a href="../snp/snp.4-10.than.ati.htm">Sn 4.10</a> state that the arahant has transcended dispassion, said to be the highest dhamma. <a href="../../mn/mn.022.than.ati.htm">MN 22</a>, in the famous simile of the raft, states that all dhammas are abandoned at the end of the path.)</p>
