Now at that time, Visakha, Migara's mother, had some dealings with <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi</a> Kosala that he did not settle as she had wished. So in the middle of the day she went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her, "Well now, Visakha, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord, I had some dealings with King Pasenadi Kosala that he did not settle as I had wished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">All subjection to others<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is painful.<br />
					All independence<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is bliss.<br />
					What is held in common<br />
					brings suffering,<br />
					for duties are hard<br />
					to overcome.</p>
