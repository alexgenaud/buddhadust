Now at that time, most of the people in Sāvatthi were excessively attached to sensuality. They lived delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensuality. Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Sāvatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Sāvatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Most of the people in Sāvatthi are excessively attached to sensuality. They live delighting in, addicted to, infatuated with, fastened to, absorbed in sensuality."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Clinging to sensuality, to sensual ties,<br />
					seeing no blame in the fetter,<br />
					never will those tied up in the fetter<br />
					cross over the flood so great and wide.</p>
