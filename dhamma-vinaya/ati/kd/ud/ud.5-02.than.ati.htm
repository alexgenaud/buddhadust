Then <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a>, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the Blessed One. On arrival, having bowed down to him, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "It's amazing, sir. It's astounding -- how short-lived the Blessed One's mother was. Seven days after the Blessed One's birth she died and arose among the Tusita (deva-) group."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, Ānanda. That's the way it is, for the mothers of bodhisattas are short-lived. Seven days after the bodhisattas' birth, the bodhisattas' mothers pass away and arise among the Tusita (deva-) group."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who have come to be,<br />
					those who will come:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will go, <br />
					leaving the body behind.<br />
					The skillful person,<br />
					realizing the loss of all,<br />
					should live the holy life<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ardently.</p>
