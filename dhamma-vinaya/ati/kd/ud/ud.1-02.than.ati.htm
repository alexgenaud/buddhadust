					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="I-2.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#I-2.1">I-2.1</a>][<a href="ud.1-02.irel.ati.htm">irel</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Awakened -- staying at <a id="Uruvela">Uruvela</a> by the banks of the <a id="neranjara">Nerañjara River</a> in the shade of the Bodhi tree, the tree of Awakening -- he sat in the shade of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one session, sensitive to the bliss of release. At the end of seven days, after emerging from that concentration, in the second watch of the night, he gave close attention to dependent co-arising in reverse order, thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">When this isn't, that isn't.<br />
					From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">In other words:</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.<br />
					From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.<br />
					From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.<br />
					From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.<br />
					From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.<br />
					From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.<br />
					From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.<br />
					From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.<br />
					From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.<br />
					From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.<br />
					From the cessation of birth, then old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>
					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">As phenomena grow clear<br />
					to the brahman -- ardent, absorbed -- <br />
					his doubts all vanish<br />
					when he penetrates the ending<br />
					of requisite conditions.</p>
