					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="VI-10.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#VI-10.1">VI-10.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Sāvatthī at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then Ven. &#256;nanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, as long as Tathāgatas — worthy and rightly self-awakened — do not appear in the world, that's when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage — recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. But when Tathāgatas — worthy and rightly self-awakened — appear in the world, that's when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage; nor are they recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. Now only the Blessed One is worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage — a recipient of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick — along with the community of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's how it is, &#256;nanda. That's how it is. As long as Tathāgatas — worthy and rightly self-awakened — do not appear in the world, that's when the wanderers of other sects are worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage — recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. But when Tathāgatas — worthy and rightly self-awakened — appear in the world, that's when the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage; nor are they recipients of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick. Now only the Tathāgata is worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, and given homage — a recipient of robes, alms food, lodgings, and medicinal requisites for the sick — along with the community of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The glowworm shines<br />
							as long as the sun hasn't risen.<br />
							But when that splendor rises,<br />
							the glowworm's light is destroyed.<br />
							It no longer shines.<br />
							Likewise, sectarians<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> shine<br />
							as long as those rightly awakened<br />
							don't appear in the world.<br />
							Those logicians<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> aren't purified,<br />
							nor are their disciples.<br />
							Those of bad views<br />
							aren't released<br />
							from stress.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In <a href="../../dn/dn.01.bodh.ati.htm">DN 1</a>, the Buddha criticizes the philosophies of many of his contemporaries for having been "hammered out by logic."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Reading <i>titthiyāna&#7747;</i> with the Thai edition. The Sri Lankan and Burmese editions read, <i>takkikāna&#7747;,</i> "logicians." The parallel passage in the Udānavarga (29.2) agrees with this latter version.</p>
