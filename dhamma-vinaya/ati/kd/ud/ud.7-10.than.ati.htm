Now at that time the inner quarters of King Udena's royal park had burned down, and 500 women, headed by <a id="samavati">Samavati</a>, had died.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Kosambī for alms. Having gone for alms in Kosambī, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "Lord, the inner quarters of King Udena's royal park have burned down, and 500 women, headed by Samavati, have died. What is the destination of those female lay followers? What is their future course?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, among those female lay followers are stream-winners, once-returners, and non-returners. In no case was the death of any of those female lay followers without [noble] fruit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Bound round with delusion, the world<br />
					only appears to be competent.<br />
					Bound with acquisitions, foolish,<br />
					surrounded by darkness,<br />
					it seems eternal,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but for one who sees,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is nothing.</p>
