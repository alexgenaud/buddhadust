					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="II-2.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#II-2.1">II-2.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="sav">Sāvatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="ana">Anāthapiṇḍika's</a> monastery. Now at that time a large number of monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, had gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: "Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: <a id="bimbisara">King Seniya Bimbisara</a> of Magadha or <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi</a> of Kosala?" And this discussion came to no conclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to the meeting hall and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready. As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic are you gathered together here? And what was the discussion that came to no conclusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at the meeting hall when this discussion arose: 'Friends, which of these two kings has greater wealth, greater possessions, the greater treasury, the greater stock of riding animals, the greater army, greater power, greater might: King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha or King Pasenadi of Kosala?' This was the discussion that had come to no conclusion when the Blessed One arrived.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It isn't right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should talk on such a topic. When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma-talk or <a id="silence">noble silence</a>."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Any sensual bliss in the world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any heavenly bliss,<br />
					isn't worth one sixteenth-sixteenth<br />
					of the bliss of the ending of craving.</p>
