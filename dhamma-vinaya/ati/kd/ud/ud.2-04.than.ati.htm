					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="II-4.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#II-4.1">II-4.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="sav">Sāvatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="ana">Anāthapiṇḍika's</a> monastery. Now at that time the Blessed One was worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. The community of monks was also worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects were not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage, nor were they recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medical requisites for the sick. So the wanderers of other sects, unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks, on seeing monks in village or forest, would insult, revile, irritate, and harass them with discourteous, abusive language.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One: "At present the Blessed One is worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. The community of monks is also worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, given homage -- a recipient of robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for the sick. But the wanderers of other sects are not worshipped, revered, honored, venerated, or given homage, nor are they recipients of robes, almsfood, lodgings, or medical requisites for the sick. So the wanderers of other sects, unable to stand the veneration given to the Blessed One and the community of monks, on seeing monks in village or forest, insult, revile, irritate, and harass them with discourteous, abusive language."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">When in contact with pleasure or pain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in village or forest,<br />
					one should blame neither<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oneself nor others.<br />
					Contacts make contact<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on a sense of acquisition.<br />
					Where there's no sense of acquisition,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contacts would make contact<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what?</p>
