Now at that time <a id="pindola">Ven. Pindola Bharadvaja</a> was sitting not far from the Blessed One, his legs crossed, his body held erect -- a forest dweller, an alms-goer, a rag-robe wearer, an owner of only one set of three robes, modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, an advocate of the ascetic practices, devoted to the heightened mind. The Blessed One saw Ven. Pindola Bharadvaja sitting not far away, his legs crossed, his body held erect -- a forest dweller, an alms-goer, a rag-robe wearer, an owner of only one set of three robes, modest, content, solitary, unentangled, his persistence aroused, an advocate of the ascetic practices, devoted to the heightened mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Not reviling, not injuring,<br />
					restraint in line with the Pāṭimokkha,<br />
					moderation in food,<br />
					dwelling in seclusion,<br />
					devotion to the heightened mind:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the teaching<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Awakened Ones.</p>
