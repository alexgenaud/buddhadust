					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="V-1.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#V-1.1">V-1.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="sav">Sāvatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a id="ana">Anāthapiṇḍika</a>'s monastery. Now at that time <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a> was together with <a id="mallika">Queen Mallika</a> in the upper palace. Then he said to her, "Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, your majesty," she answered. "There is no one more dear to me than myself. And what about you, your majesty? Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Mallika. There is no one more dear to me than myself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the king, descending from the palace, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Just now I was together with Queen Mallika in the upper palace. I said to her, 'Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, your majesty,' she answered. 'There is no one more dear to me than myself. And what about you, your majesty? Is there anyone more dear to you than yourself?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, Mallika. There is no one more dear to me than myself.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Searching all directions<br />
					with one's awareness,<br />
					one finds no one dearer<br />
					than oneself.<br />
					In the same way, others<br />
					are fiercely dear to themselves.<br />
					So one should not hurt others<br />
					if one loves oneself.</p>
