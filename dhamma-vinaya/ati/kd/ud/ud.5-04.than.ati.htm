Now at that time, a large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthi and Jeta's Grove were catching fish. Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthi for alms. He saw the large number of boys on the road between Sāvatthi and Jeta's Grove catching fish. Seeing them, he went up to them and, on arrival, said to them: "Boys, do you fear pain? Do you dislike pain?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, we fear pain. We dislike pain."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">If you fear pain,<br />
					if you dislike pain,<br />
					don't do an evil deed<br />
					in open or secret.<br />
					If you're doing or will do<br />
					an evil deed,<br />
					you won't escape pain:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it will catch you<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even as you run away.</p>
