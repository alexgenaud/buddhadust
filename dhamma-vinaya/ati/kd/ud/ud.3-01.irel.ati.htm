At one time the Lord was staying near Sāvatthi in the Jeta Wood at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. On that occasion a certain bhikkhu was sitting cross-legged not far from the Lord, holding his body erect, mindful and clearly comprehending, enduring without complaint feelings that were painful, acute, sharp and severe, the ripening of former action.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Lord saw that bhikkhu sitting cross-legged not far away... enduring without complaint feelings that were painful, acute, sharp and severe, the ripening of former action.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing its significance, the Lord uttered on that occasion this inspired utterance:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>A bhikkhu who has left behind all action,<br />
							Shaking off the dust of former deeds.<br />
							The stable one, unselfish, steady,<br />
							Has no need to address people.</i></p>
