					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="IV-4.1" href="../../../pali/kd/ud/ud.1-8.pali.bd.htm#IV-4.1">IV-4.1</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> at the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels' Sanctuary. Now at that time <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a> and <a id="moggallana">Ven. Maha Moggallāna</a> were staying in <a id="pigeon">Pigeon Cave</a>. Then, on a moonlit night, Ven. Sāriputta -- his head newly shaven -- was sitting in the open air, having attained a certain level of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">It so happened that two yakkhas who were companions were flying from north to south on some business or other. They saw Ven. Sāriputta -- his head newly shaven -- sitting in the open air. Seeing him, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time, the first yakkha said to the second, "I'm inspired to give this contemplative a blow on the head."</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time, the second yakkha said to the first, "Enough of that, my good friend. Don't lay a hand on the contemplative. He's an outstanding contemplative, of great power and great might."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the first yakkha, ignoring the second yakkha, gave Ven. Sāriputta a blow on the head. And with that blow he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But right there the yakkha -- yelling, "I'm burning!" -- fell into the Great Hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Ven. Moggallāna -- with his divine eye, pure and surpassing the human -- saw the yakkha give Ven. Sāriputta a blow on the head. Seeing this, he went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, said to him, "I hope you are well, friend Sāriputta. I hope you are comfortable. I hope you are feeling no pain."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am well, friend Moggallāna. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache."</p>

					<p class="f4">"How amazing, friend Sāriputta! How awesome! How great your power and might! Just now a yakkha gave you a blow on the head. So great was that blow that he might have knocked over an elephant seven or eight cubits tall, or split a rocky crag. But all you say is this: 'I am well, friend Moggallāna. I am comfortable. But I do have a slight headache'!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How amazing, friend Moggallāna! How awesome! How great your power and might! Where you saw a yakkha just now, I didn't even see a dust devil!"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One -- with his divine ear, pure and surpassing the human -- heard those two great beings speak in praise of one another in this way. Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whose mind is like rock,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steady,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unmoved,<br />
					dispassionate for things that spark passion,<br />
					unangered by things that spark anger:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one's mind is developed like this,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from where can there come<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering and stress?</p>
