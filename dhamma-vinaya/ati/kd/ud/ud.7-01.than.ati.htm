At that time <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a> was with a variety of approaches instructing, urging, rousing, and encouraging <a id="bhaddiya">Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf</a> with Dhamma-talk. As Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sāriputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw that as Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf was, with a variety of approaches, being instructed, urged, roused, and encouraged by Ven. Sāriputta with Dhamma-talk, his mind, through lack of clinging/sustenance, was released from the effluents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">Above, below, everywhere released,<br />
					he does not focus on 'I am this.'<br />
					Thus released, he crosses the flood<br />
					not crossed before,<br />
					for the sake of no further becoming.</p>
