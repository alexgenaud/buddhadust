Now at that time a certain lay follower from Icchanangalaka had arrived in Sāvatthi on some business affairs. Having settled his affairs in Sāvatthi, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "At long last you have managed to come here."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time I have wanted to come see the Blessed One, lord, but being involved in one business affair after another, I have not been able to do so."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4">How blissful it is, for one who has nothing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who has mastered the Dhamma,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is learned.<br />
					See how they suffer, those who have something,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people bound in body<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with people.</p>
