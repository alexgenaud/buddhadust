					<p class="f4">Black was my hair<br />
					— the color of bees — <br />
					and curled at the tips;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with age, it looked like coarse hemp.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fragrant, like a perfumed basket<br />
					filled with flowers: my coiffure.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age it smelled musty,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like animal fur.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thick and lush, like a well-tended grove,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it grew thin<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and bare here and there.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Adorned with gold and delicate pins,<br />
					it was splendid, ornamented with braids.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, with age,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that head has gone bald.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Curved, as if well-drawn by an artist,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they droop down in folds.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like that of a cuckoo in the dense jungle,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, it's broken down, bent.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like rounded door-bars — both of them — <br />
					my arms were once splendid.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like dried up patali trees.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Adorned with gold and delicate rings,<br />

					<p class="f4">Like a sheet of gold, well-burnished,<br />

					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Smooth in their lines, like an elephant's trunk,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With age, they're like sesame sticks.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">As if they were stuffed with soft cotton,<br />

					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such was this physical heap,<br />
					now: decrepit, the home of pains, many pains.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A house with its plaster all fallen off.<br />
					The truth of the Truth-speaker's words<br />

					<p class="f4">You go to sleep saying,<br />

					No doubt you will be <br />

					<p class="f4">Abundant food and drink<br />

					Now, Rohini, I ask you:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you hold<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear?</p>

					<p class="f4">They don't like to work,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're lazy,<br />

					full of hankerings,<br />
					wanting delicious things:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you hold<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Rohini:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">For a long time, father,<br />
					you've quizzed me <br />
					about contemplatives.<br />
					I'll praise to you<br />
					their&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; virtue,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endeavor.</p>

					<p class="f4">They do like to work,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they're not lazy.<br />
					They do the best work:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They abandon<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.</p>

					<p class="f4">They rid themselves<br />
					of the three evil roots,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					doing pure actions.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All their evil's<br />

					they teach the goal<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the Dhamma:<br />

					<p class="f4">Learned, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; maintaining the Dhamma,<br />

					<p class="f4">Traveling far, mindful,<br />
					giving counsel unruffled,<br />
					they discern the end<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of suffering:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; contemplatives dear.</p>

					<p class="f4">When they leave any village<br />
					they don't turn to look back<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at anything.<br />
					How free from sense of compunction<br />
					they go!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why I hold<br />

					You have conviction <br />

					<h4 class="c"><span class="f3"><a id="p70">XIII.5</a>[<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thig/idx_thig.htm#p70">idx</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/thig/thig.pali.bd.htm#p70">pāḷi</a>]</span> — Subha, the Goldsmith's Daughter</h4>

					<p class="f4">"I was child, with clean clothes,<br />
					when I first heard the Dhamma.<br />
					And within me, heedful,<br />
					was a break-through to the truth.<br />
					Then I arrived <br />
					at an enormous dissatisfaction<br />
					with all sensuality.<br />
					Seeing the danger <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in self-identity,<br />
					I longed only <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for renunciation.<br />
					Leaving my circle of relatives,<br />
					slaves, workers, <br />
					prosperous villages and fields,<br />
					delightful, enticing possessions,<br />
					I went forth,<br />
					abandoning not-insignificant wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having gone out through conviction<br />
					in the well-taught true Dhamma,<br />
					it wouldn't be proper for me — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aspiring to nothingness — <br />
					having cast off gold and silver<br />
					to take them back.<br />
					Gold and silver <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't buy Awakening,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't buy peace.<br />
					This [gold] isn't proper for contemplatives.<br />
					This isn't noble wealth.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is<br />
					greediness, intoxication, <br />
					delusion, bondage to dust, <br />
					suspicion, many troubles.<br />
					There's no lasting stability here.<br />
					It's to this extent that many, many men<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  — heedless, their hearts defiled — <br />
					opposing one another, create <br />
					conflicts, murder, bondage,<br />
					calamity, loss, grief, and lamentation.<br />
					Many misfortunes are seen<br />
					for those head-over-heels in sensuality.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my relatives:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you, like enemies, <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try to bind me to sensuality?<br />
					You know I've gone forth,<br />
					seeing the danger in sensuality.<br />
					Gold coin and bullion<br />
					can't put an end to effluents.<br />
					Sensuality is an enemy,<br />
					a murderer,<br />
					hostile, arrows and bonds.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, my relatives:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you, like enemies, <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try to bind me to sensuality?<br />
					You know I've gone forth <br />
					with shaven head, wrapped in a patchwork cloak.<br />
					Leftover alms-scraps, gleanings,<br />
					a robe made from cast-off cloth:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>That's</i> what's proper for me — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the requisites of one with no home.<br />
					The great seers have rejected sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; both human and divine.<br />
					Released are they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the place of security.<br />
					Arrived are they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in unshakeable ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">So may I not come into union <br />
					with sensuality, in which no shelter is found.<br />
					It's an enemy, a murderer<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — sensuality — <br />
					painful, like a mass of flame.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greed: <br />
					an obstacle, fearful, threatened,<br />
					full of thorns,<br />
					very out-of-tune,<br />
					a great cause of delusion.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sensuality:<br />
					a frightening attack,<br />
					like a snake's head<br />
					in which fools delight — <br />
					blinded, run-of-the-mill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because many people in the world<br />
					are stuck in the mud of sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unknowing,<br />
					they don't realize the end of birth and death.<br />
					Many people follow the path <br />
					to bad destinations<br />
					because of sensuality,<br />
					bringing disease on themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus sensuality creates enemies.<br />
					It burns, is defiled.<br />
					It's the bait of the world,<br />
					constraining, the bondage of death,<br />
					maddening, deceptive, agitating the mind.<br />
					It's a net cast by <a id="mara5">Mara</a><br />
					for the defilement of living beings:<br />
					with endless drawbacks, much pain,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great poison, <br />
					giving little enjoyment, creating conflict,<br />
					drying up the good side [of the mind].<br />
					I, having caused much trouble like this<br />
					because of sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will not return to it,<br />
					as I always delight in Unbinding.<br />
					Doing battle with sensuality<br />
					in hopes of the cool state,<br />
					I will stay heedful, finding delight<br />
					in the ending of fetters.<br />
					I follow the path — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eightfold, straight,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; griefless, stainless, secure — <br />
					over which great seers<br />
					have crossed."</p>
