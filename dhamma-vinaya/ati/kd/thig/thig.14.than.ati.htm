					<p class="f4">As Subha the nun was going through <a id="jivaka">Jivaka's</a> delightful mango grove, a libertine (a goldsmith's son) blocked her path, so she said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What wrong have I done you<br />
					that you stand in my way?<br />
					It's not proper, my friend,<br />
					that a man should touch<br />
					a woman gone forth.<br />
					I respect the Master's message,<br />
					the training pointed out by the one well-gone.<br />
					I am pure, without blemish:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you stand in my way?<br />
					You — your mind agitated, impassioned;<br />
					I — unagitated, unimpassioned,<br />
					with a mind entirely freed:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why do you stand in my way?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are young and not bad-looking,<br />
					what need do you have for going forth?<br />
					Throw off your ochre robe — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's delight in the flowering grove.<br />
					A sweetness they exude everywhere,<br />
					the towering trees with their pollen.<br />
					The beginning of spring is a pleasant season — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come, let's delight in the flowering grove.<br />
					The trees with their blossoming tips<br />
					moan, as it were, in the breeze:<br />
					What delight will you have<br />
					if you plunge into the grove alone?<br />
					Frequented by herds of wild beasts,<br />
					disturbed by elephants rutting and aroused:<br />
					you want to go<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unaccompanied<br />
					into the great, lonely, frightening grove?<br />
					Like a doll made of gold, you will go about,<br />
					like a goddess in the gardens of heaven.<br />
					With delicate, smooth <a id="Kāsī">Kāsī</a> fabrics,<br />
					you will shine, O beauty without compare.<br />
					I would gladly do your every bidding<br />
					if we were to dwell in the glade.<br />
					For there is no creature dearer to me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than you, O nymph with the languid regard.<br />
					If you do as I ask, happy, come live in my house.<br />
					Dwelling in the calm of a palace,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have women wait on you,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wear delicate Kāsī fabrics,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adorn yourself with garlands and creams.<br />
					I will make you many and varied ornaments<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of gold, jewels, and pearls.<br />
					Climb onto a costly bed,<br />
					scented with sandalwood carvings,<br />
					with a well-washed coverlet, beautiful,<br />
					spread with a woolen quilt, brand new.<br />
					Like a blue lotus rising from the water<br />
					where no human beings dwell,<br />
					you will go to old age with your limbs unseen,<br />
					if you stay as you are in the holy life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What do you assume of any essence,<br />
					here in this cemetery grower, filled with corpses,<br />
					this body destined to break up?<br />
					What do you see when you look at me,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you who are out of your mind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Your eyes are like those of a fawn,<br />
					like those of a sprite in the mountains.<br />
					Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows all the more.<br />
					Like tips they are, of blue lotuses,<br />
					in your golden face<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — spotless:<br />
					Seeing your eyes, my sensual delight<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grows all the more.<br />
					Even if you should go far away,<br />
					I will think only of your pure,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long-lashed gaze,<br />
					for there is nothing dearer to me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than your eyes, O nymph with the languid regard.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You want to stray from the road,<br />
					you want the moon as a plaything,<br />
					you want to jump over <a id="sineru">Mount Sineru</a>,<br />
					you who have designs on one born of the Buddha.<br />
					For there is nothing anywhere at all<br />
					in the cosmos with its gods,<br />
					that would be an object of passion for me.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even know what that passion would be,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been killed, root and all, by the path.<br />
					<a id="embers">Like embers</a> from a pit — scattered,<br />
					<a id="bowl">like a bowl of poison</a> — evaporated,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't even see what that passion would be,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for it's been killed, root and all, by the path.<br />
					Try to seduce one who hasn't reflected on this,<br />
					or who has not followed the Master's teaching.<br />
					But try it with this one who knows<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and you suffer.<br />
					For in the midst of praise and blame,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure and pain,<br />
					my mindfulness stands firm.<br />
					Knowing the unattractiveness<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of things compounded,<br />
					my mind cleaves to nothing at all.<br />
					I am a follower of the one well-gone,<br />
					riding the vehicle of the eightfold way:<br />
					My arrow removed, effluent-free,<br />
					I delight, having gone to an empty dwelling.<br />
					For I have seen well-painted puppets,<br />
					hitched up with sticks and strings,<br />
					made to dance in various ways.<br />
					When the sticks and strings are removed,<br />
					thrown away, scattered, shredded,<br />
					smashed into pieces, not to be found,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its home?<br />
					This body of mine, which is just like that,<br />
					when devoid of dhammas doesn't function.<br />
					When, devoid of dhammas, it doesn't function,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in what will the mind there make its home?<br />
					<a id="mural">Like a mural</a> you've seen, painted on a wall,<br />
					smeared with yellow orpiment,<br />
					there your vision has been distorted,<br />
					meaningless your human perception.<br />
					<a id="mirage">Like an evaporated</a> mirage,<br />
					<a id="gold">like a tree of gold</a> in a dream,<br />
					<a id="magic">like a magic show</a> in the midst of a crowd — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you run blind after what is unreal.<br />
					Resembling a ball of sealing wax,<br />
					set in a hollow,<br />
					with a bubble in the middle<br />
					and bathed with tears,<br />
					eye secretions are born there too:<br />
					The parts of the eye<br />
					are rolled all together<br />
					in various ways.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Plucking out her lovely eye,<br />
					with mind unattached<br />
					she felt no regret.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Here, take this eye. It's yours.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Straightaway she gave it to him.<br />
					Straightaway his passion faded right there,<br />
					and he begged her forgiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Be well, follower of the holy life.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This sort of thing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't happen again.<br />
					Harming a person like you<br />
					is like embracing a blazing fire,<br />
					It is as if I have seized a poisonous snake.<br />
					So may you be well. Forgive me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And released from there, the nun<br />
					went to the excellent Buddha's presence.<br />
					When she saw the mark of his excellent merit,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; her eye became<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it was before.</p>
