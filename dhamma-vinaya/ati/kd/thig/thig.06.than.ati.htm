					<p class="f4"><i>[Patacara recounts the Buddha's words:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"You don't know<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the path<br />
					of his coming or going,<br />
					that being who has come<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where? — <br />
					the one you lament as 'my son.'<br />
					But when you know<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the path<br />
					of his coming or going,<br />
					you don't grieve after him,<br />
					for that is the nature<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unasked,<br />
					he came from there.<br />
					Without permission,<br />
					he went from here — <br />
					coming from &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where?<br />
					having stayed a few days.<br />
					And coming one way from here,<br />
					he goes yet another<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from there.<br />
					Dying in the human form,<br />
					he will go wandering on.<br />
					As he came, so he has gone — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so what is there<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to lament?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Pulling out<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — completely out — <br />
					the arrow so hard to see,<br />
					embedded in my heart,<br />
					he expelled from me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — overcome with grief — <br />
					the grief<br />
					over my son.</p>

					<p class="f4">Today — with arrow removed,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without hunger, entirely<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbound — <br />
					to the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saŋgha I go,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for refuge to<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Sage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Overwhelmed with grief for my son — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; naked, demented,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my hair dishevelled<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my mind deranged — <br />
					I went about here and there,<br />
					living along the side of the road,<br />
					in cemeteries and heaps of trash,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for three full years,<br />
					afflicted with hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I saw<br />
					the One Well-gone,<br />
					gone to the city of <a id="mithila">Mithila</a>:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tamer of those untamed,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Awakened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with nothing to fear<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from anything, anywhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">Regaining my mind,<br />
					paying him homage,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat myself down.<br />
					He, Gotama, from sympathy<br />
					taught me the Dhamma.<br />
					Hearing his Dhamma,<br />
					I went forth into homelessness.<br />
					Applying myself to the Teacher's words,<br />
					I realized the state of auspicious bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">All griefs have been cut off,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abandoned,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; brought to this end,<br />
					for I've comprehended<br />
					the grounds from which griefs<br />
					come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">Born in a high-ranking family<br />
					with much property, great wealth,<br />
					consummate in complexion and figure,<br />
					I was the daughter of <a id="majjha">Majjha</a>, the treasurer.<br />
					Sons of kings sought for me,<br />
					sons of rich merchants<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longed for me.<br />
					One of them sent my father a messenger,<br />
					saying, "Give me Anopama.<br />
					I will give in return<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eight times her weight<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in jewels and gold."<br />
					But I, having seen<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the One Self-awakened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsurpassed, excelling the world,<br />
					paid homage to his feet,<br />
					sat down to one side.<br />
					He, Gotama, from sympathy,<br />
					taught me the Dhamma.<br />
					And as I sat in that very seat,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I attained the third fruit<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [of non-return.]<br />
					Then I cut off my hair,<br />
					and went forth into homelessness.<br />
					Today is the seventh day<br />
					since I made craving<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wither away.</p>
