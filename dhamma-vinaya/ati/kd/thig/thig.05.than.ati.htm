					<p class="f4">Intoxicated with my complexion<br />

					haughty with youth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I despised other women.<br />
					Adorning this body<br />
					embellished to delude foolish men,<br />
					I stood at the door to the brothel:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a hunter with snare laid out.<br />
					I showed off my ornaments,<br />
					and revealed many a private part.<br />
					I worked my manifold magic,<br />
					laughing out loud at the crowd.</p>

					<p class="f4">Today, wrapped in a double cloak,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my head shaven,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having wandered for alms,<br />
					I sit at the foot of a tree<br />
					and attain the state of no-thought.<br />
					All ties — human and divine — have been cut.<br />
					Having cast off all effluents,<br />
					cooled am I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.</p>

					<p class="f4">Considering it thus,<br />

					<p class="f4">And as I, heedful,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; examined it aptly,<br />

					<p class="f4">Going forth through conviction<br />

					Missing out on the foremost goal,<br />
					I pursued a lowly one.<br />
					Under the sway of defilements<br />
					I surrendered the goal<br />
					of the contemplative life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, sitting in my dwelling,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next to nothing, my life — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by aging and illness.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the body breaks apart,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no time<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">After watching, as it actually was,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.</p>

					Hearing her Dhamma,<br />
					I cut off my hair and ordained.<br />
					Having purified the divine eye<br />
					while still a probationer,<br />
					I know my previous lives,<br />
					where I lived in the past.<br />
					I develop the theme-less meditation,<br />
					well-focused oneness.<br />
					I gain the liberation of immediacy — <br />
					from lack of clinging, unbound.<br />
					The five aggregates, comprehended,<br />
					stand <a id="tree8">like a tree</a> with its root cut through.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spit on old age.<br />
