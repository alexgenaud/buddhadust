					<p class="f4"><i>[Punnika:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I'm a water-carrier, cold,<br />
					always going down to the water<br />
					from fear of my mistresses' beatings,<br />
					harrassed by their anger and words.<br />
					But you, Brahman,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what do you fear<br />
					that you're always going down to the water<br />
					with shivering limbs, feeling great cold?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Brahman:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Punnika, surely you know.<br />
					You're asking one doing skillful kamma<br />
					and warding off evil.<br />
					Whoever, young or old, does evil kamma<br />
					is, through water ablution,<br />
					from evil kamma set free.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Punnika:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Who taught you this<br />
					— the ignorant to the ignorant — <br />
					'One, through water ablution,<br />
					is from evil kamma set free?'<br />
					In that case, they'd all go to heaven:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the frogs, turtles,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; serpents, crocodiles,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and anything else that lives in the water.<br />
					Sheep-butchers, pork-butchers,<br />
					fishermen, trappers,<br />
					thieves, executioners,<br />
					and any other evil doers,<br />
					would, through water ablution,<br />
					be from evil kamma set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">If these rivers could carry off<br />
					the evil kamma you've done in the past,<br />
					they'd carry off your merit as well,<br />
					and then you'd be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completely left out.<br />
					Whatever it is that you fear,<br />
					that you're always going down to the water,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't do it.<br />
					Don't let the cold hurt your skin."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Brahman:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I've been following the miserable path, good lady,<br />
					and now you've brought me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; back to the noble.<br />
					I give you this robe for water-ablution.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Punnika:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Let the robe be yours. I don't need it.<br />
					If you're afraid of pain,<br />
					if you dislike pain,<br />
					then don't do any evil kamma,<br />
					in open, in secret.<br />
					But if you do or will do<br />
					any evil kamma,<br />
					you'll gain no freedom from pain,<br />
					even if you fly up and hurry away.<br />
					If you're afraid of pain,<br />
					if you dislike pain,<br />
					go to the Awakened One for refuge,<br />
					go to the Dhamma and Saŋgha.<br />
					Take on the precepts:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will lead to your liberation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Brahman:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Awakened One for refuge;<br />
					I go to the Dhamma and Saŋgha.<br />
					I take on the precepts:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That will lead to my liberation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before, I was a kinsman to <a id="brahma">Brahma</a>;<br />
					now, truly a brahman.<br />
					I'm a three-knowledge man.<br />
					consummate in knowledge,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safe and washed clean.</p>
