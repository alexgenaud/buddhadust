					<p class="f4"><a id="bull">Just as</a> a fine, well-bred bull<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yoked to a load,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enduring his load,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the heavy burden,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't throw down his yoke;<br />
					so, too, those who are filled with discernment<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- as the ocean, with water -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't look down on others.<br />
					This is nobility among beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having fallen in time<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; under the sway of time,<br />
					having come under the sway<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of becoming-becoming,<br />
					people fall subject to pain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and they grieve.</p>

					<p class="f4">Elated by the causes of pleasure,<br />
					and cast down by causes of pain,<br />
					fools are destroyed by both,<br />
					not seeing them for what they are.<br />
					While those who, in the midst of<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pleasure and pain<br />
					have gone past the seamstress of craving,<br />
					stand firm<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a boundary pillar,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither elated nor cast down.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not to gain or loss<br />
					not to status or honor,<br />
					not to praise or blame,<br />
					not to pleasure or pain:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere<br />
					they do not adhere -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a water bead<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a lotus.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everywhere<br />
					they are happy, the enlightened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; un-<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated.</p>

					<p class="f4">No matter what<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unrighteous gain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the righteous loss,<br />
					righteous loss is better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were unrighteous gain.<br />
					No matter what<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the status of the unaware<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the lowliness of those who know,<br />
					the lowliness of those who know<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not the status of those<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unaware.<br />
					No matter what<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the praise from fools<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or the censure from those who know,<br />
					the censure from those who know<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were praise<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fools.<br />
					And as for the pleasure<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from sensuality<br />
					and the pain from seclusion,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the pain from seclusion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if there were pleasure<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from sensuality.<br />
					And as for living through unrighteousness<br />
					and dying for righteousness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dying for righteousness<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is better,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than if one were to live<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; through unrighteousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who've abandoned<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensuality and anger,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose minds are calmed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from becoming and non-,<br />
					go through the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unattached.<br />
					For them there is nothing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dear or undear.<br />
					Developing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the factors for Awakening,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faculties,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and strengths,<br />
					attaining the foremost peace,<br />
					without effluent, they<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are entirely<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbound.</p>
