					<p class="f4">One shouldn't go about<br />
					surrounded, revered<br />
					by a company:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one gets distracted;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concentration<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hard to gain.<br />
					Fellowship with many people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is painful.<br />
					Seeing this,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one shouldn't approve<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a company.</p>

					<p class="f4">A sage shouldn't visit families:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one gets distracted;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; concentration<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hard to gain.<br />
					He's eager and greedy for flavors,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever misses the goal<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that brings bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">They know it's a bog -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the reverence and veneration<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of families -- <br />
					a subtle arrow, hard to extract.<br />
					Offerings are hard for a worthless man<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to let go.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Coming down from my dwelling place,<br />
					I entered the city for alms,<br />
					stood courteously next to a leper<br />
					eating his meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, with his rotting hand,<br />
					tossed me a morsel of food,<br />
					and as the morsel was dropping,<br />
					a finger fell off<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting next to a wall,<br />
					I ate that morsel of food,<br />
					and neither while eating it,<br />
					nor having eaten,<br />
					did I feel<br />
					any disgust.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever has mastered<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; left-over scraps for food,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smelly urine for medicine,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the foot of a tree for a dwelling,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cast-off rags for robes:<br />
					<i>He</i> is a man<br />
					of the four directions.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Where some are exhausted<br />
					climbing the mountain,<br />
					there <br />
					the Awakened One's heir<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- mindful, alert,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; buoyed by his psychic power -- <br />
					Kassapa climbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Returning from his alms round,<br />
					climbing the peak,<br />
					Kassapa does jhāna<br />
					with no sustenance/clinging,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having abandoned terror<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Returning from his alms round,<br />
					climbing the peak,<br />
					Kassapa does jhāna<br />
					with no sustenance/clinging,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among those who burn.</p>

					<p class="f4">Returning from his alms round,<br />
					climbing the peak,<br />
					Kassapa does jhāna<br />
					with no sustenance/clinging,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free of effluent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his duty<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.</p>

					<p class="f4">Spread with garlands of vines,<br />
					places delighting the mind,<br />
					resounding with elephants,<br />
					appealing:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The color of blue-dark clouds,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glistening,<br />
					cooled with the waters<br />
					of clear-flowing streams<br />
					covered with ladybugs:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the peaks of blue-dark clouds,<br />
					like excellent peaked-roof buildings,<br />
					resounding with tuskers,<br />
					appealing:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Their lovely surfaces wet with rain,<br />
					mountains frequented<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by seers<br />
					and echoing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with peacocks:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is enough for me --<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring to do jhāna,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute, mindful;<br />
					enough for me --<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring the goal,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monk;<br />
					enough for me --<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring comfort,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in training;<br />
					enough for me --<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desiring my duty,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such.</p>

					<p class="f4">Flax-flower blue,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the sky<br />
					covered over with clouds;<br />
					filled with flocks<br />
					of various birds:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncrowded<br />
					by householders,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequented<br />
					by herds of deer<br />
					filled with flocks<br />
					of various birds:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">With clear waters and<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; massive boulders,<br />
					frequented by monkeys and<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deer,<br />
					covered with moss and<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; water weeds:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those rocky crags<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; refresh me.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no such pleasure for me<br />
					in the music of a five-piece band<br />
					as there is when my mind<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is at one,<br />
					seeing the Dhamma<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aright.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">One shouldn't do lots of work,<br />
					should avoid people,<br />
					shouldn't busy oneself.<br />
					He's eager and greedy for flavors,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever misses the goal<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that brings bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">One shouldn't do lots of work,<br />
					should avoid<br />
					what doesn't lead to the goal.<br />
					The body gets wearied,<br />
					fatigued.<br />
					Aching, one finds<br />
					no tranquillity.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Simply by flapping the mouth<br />
					one doesn't see<br />
					even oneself.<br />
					One goes around stiff-<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; necked,<br />
					thinking, 'I'm better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than they.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Not better,<br />
					he thinks himself better,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the fool:<br />
					the wise don't praise him,<br />
					the stiff-necked man.</p>

					<p class="f4">But whoever isn't stirred<br />
					by the modes of<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm better,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not better.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm worse.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm like that';<br />
					one who's discerning,<br />
					who acts as he says,<br />
					well-centered<br />
					in virtues,<br />
					committed to<br />
					tranquillity of awareness, he<br />
					is the one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the wise<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">One with no respect<br />
					for his fellows in the holy life,<br />
					is as far<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the true Dhamma<br />
					as the earth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is from the sky.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those whose sense of shame<br />
					and fear of evil<br />
					are always rightly established: they<br />
					have flourished in the holy life.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For them<br />
					there's no further becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk conceited and vain,<br />
					even though clad<br />
					in a robe of cast-off rags,<br />
					like a monkey in a lion's skin,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doesn't shine because of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a monk not conceited<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or vain,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; masterful,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his faculties restrained, shines<br />
					because of his robe of cast-off rags,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the cleft of a mountain.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">These many devas,<br />
					powerful, prestigious<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 10,000 devas --<br />
					all of Brahma's retinue,<br />
					stand with their hands over their hearts,<br />
					paying homage to Sāriputta,<br />
					the Dhamma-general,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enlightened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centered,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great master of jhāna,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [saying:]</p>

					<p class="f4">'Homage to you, O thoroughbred man.<br />
					Homage to you, O superlative man --<br />
					of whom we have no direct knowledge<br />
					even of that<br />
					in dependence on which<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you do jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">'How very amazing:<br />
					the awakened ones'<br />
					very own deep range --<br />
					of which we have no direct knowledge,<br />
					though we have come<br />
					as hair-splitting archers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing Sāriputta,<br />
					a man worthy of worship,<br />
					worshipped by deva retinues,<br />
					Kappina<br />
					smiled.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as this Buddha-field extends<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- except for the great sage himself --<br />
					I'm the one<br />
					outstanding<br />
					in ascetic qualities.<br />
					There's no one else<br />
					like me.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has been served by me;<br />
					the Awakened One's bidding,</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done;<br />
					the heavy load, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid down;<br />
					the guide to becoming, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uprooted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither to robe,<br />
					nor dwelling,<br />
					nor food<br />
					does he cling:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotama,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a lotus unspotted<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by water, inclining<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to renunciation, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; detached<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the three planes of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">He,<br />
					the great sage,<br />
					has the frames of reference<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as his neck,<br />
					conviction<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as hands,<br />
					discernment<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as head.<br />
					The great master of jhāna<br />
					he goes about<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always unbound.</p>
