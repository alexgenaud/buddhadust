					<p class="f4">One should not do much work<br />
					One should avoid people,<br />
					One should not bustle (to obtain gifts).<br />
					One who is eager and greedy for flavors<br />
					Misses the goal that entails happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">They knew as a bog this homage and veneration<br />
					Obtained among devoted families.<br />
					A subtle dart, difficult to extract,<br />
					Honor is hard for a vile man to discard.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not on account of another<br />
					That a mortal's kamma is evil.<br />
					On one's own accord one should not resort to evil,<br />
					For mortals have kamma as their kinsmen.</p>

					<p class="f4">One is not a thief by another's word,<br />
					One is not a sage by another's word;<br />
					It is as one knows oneself<br />
					That the devas also know one.</p>

					<p class="f4">Others do not understand<br />
					That we all come to an end here.<br />
					But those wise ones who understand this<br />
					Thereby settle their quarrels.</p>

					<p class="f4">The wise man lives indeed<br />
					Even despite the loss of his wealth.<br />
					But if one does not obtain wisdom,<br />
					Then even though rich one is not alive.</p>

					<p class="f4">One hears all with the ear,<br />
					One sees all with the eye,<br />
					The wise man should not reject<br />
					Everything that is seen and heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">One with eyes should be as if blind,<br />
					One with ears as if deaf,<br />
					One with wisdom as if mute,<br />
					One with strength as if feeble.<br />
					Then, when the goal has been attained,<br />
					One may lie upon one's death bed.</p>
