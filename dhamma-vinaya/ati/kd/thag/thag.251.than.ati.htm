					<p><b>Translator's note:</b> The verses here fall into three sections, with the first two relating to Ratthapala's story as told in <a href="../../mn/mn.082.than.ati.htm">MN 82</a>. In the first, Ratthapala is addressing his father after the latter had tried to use wealth and Ratthapala's former wives to lure Ratthapala into disrobing. In the second section, Ratthapala is talking to King Koravya, who had asked him why he had ordained when he was still young and healthy, and had suffered no loss of relatives or wealth.</p>

					<p>The third section of verses here does not occur in <a href="../../mn/mn.082.than.ati.htm">MN 82</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Look at the image beautified,<br />
					a heap of festering wounds, shored up:<br />
					ill, but the object<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;of many resolves,<br />
					where there is nothing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;lasting or sure.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Look at the form beautified<br />
					with earrings and gems:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;a skeleton wrapped in skin,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;made attractive with clothes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feet reddened with henna,<br />
					a face smeared with powder:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to deceive a fool,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;but not a seeker for the further shore.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hair plaited in eight pleats,<br />
					eyes smeared with unguent:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to deceive a fool,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;but not a seeker for the further shore.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like a newly painted unguent pot &mdash;
					a putrid body adorned:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to deceive a fool,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;but not a seeker for the further shore.</p>

					<p class="f4">The hunter set out the snares,<br />
					but the deer didn't go near the trap.<br />
					Having eaten the bait,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;we go,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving the hunters<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to weep.</p>

					<p class="f4">The hunter's snares are broken;<br />
					the deer didn't go near the trap.<br />
					Having eaten the bait,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we go,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;leaving the hunters<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to grieve.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I see in the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;people with wealth<br />
					who, from delusion,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;don't make a gift<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;of the treasure they've gained.<br />
					Greedy, they stash it away,<br />
					hoping for even more<br />
					sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">A king who, by force,<br />
					has conquered the world<br />
					and rules over the earth<br />
					to the edge of the sea,<br />
					dissatisfied with the ocean's near shore,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;longs for the ocean's<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;far shore as well.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kings and others<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; plenty of people &mdash;<br />
					go to death with craving<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;unabated. Unsated,<br />
					they leave the body behind,<br />
					having not had enough<br />
					of the world's sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">One's relatives weep<br />
					and pull out their hair.<br />
					'Oh woe, our loved one is dead,' they cry.<br />
					Carrying him off,<br />
					wrapped in a piece of cloth,<br />
					they place him<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;on a pyre,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;then set him on fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he burns, poked with sticks,<br />
					in just one piece of cloth,<br />
					leaving all his possessions behind.<br />
					They are not shelters for one who has died &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;not relatives,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;friends,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;or companions.</p>

					<p class="f4">His heirs take over his wealth,<br />
					while the being goes on,<br />
					in line with his kamma.<br />
					No wealth at all<br />
					follows the dead one &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;not children, wives,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;dominion, or riches.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long life<br />
					can't be gotten with wealth,<br />
					nor aging<br />
					warded off with treasure.<br />
					The wise say this life<br />
					is next to nothing &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;impermanent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;subject to change.</p>

					<p class="f4">The rich and the poor<br />
					touch the touch of Death.<br />
					The foolish and wise<br />
					are touched by it, too.<br />
					But while fools lie as if slain by their folly,<br />
					the wise don't tremble<br />
					when touched by the touch.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the discernment by which<br />
					one attains to mastery,<br />
					is better than wealth &mdash;<br />
					for those who haven't reached mastery<br />
					go from existence to existence,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;out of delusion,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;doing bad deeds.</p>

					<p class="f4">One goes to a womb<br />
					and to the next world,<br />
					falling into the wandering on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; one thing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;after another &mdash;<br />
					while those of weak discernment,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;trusting in one,<br />
					also go to a womb<br />
					and to the next world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as an evil thief<br />
					caught at the break-in<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;is destroyed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;by his own act,<br />
					so evil people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; after dying, in the next world &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;are destroyed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;by their own acts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual pleasures &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;variegated,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;enticing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet &mdash;<br />
					in various ways disturb the mind.<br />
					Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects:<br />
					that's why, O king, I went forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just like fruits, people fall<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash; young and old &mdash;<br />
					at the break-up of the body.<br />
					Knowing this, O king,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;I went forth.<br />
					The contemplative life is better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;for sure.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Out of conviction,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;I went forth<br />
					equipped with the Victor's message.<br />
					Blameless<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> was my going-forth:<br />
					Debtless I eat my food.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing sensuality as burning,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gold as a knife,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;pain in the entry into the womb<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;and great danger in hells &mdash;<br />
					seeing this peril, I was then dismayed &mdash;<br />
					pierced (with dismay), then calmed<br />
					on attaining effluents' end.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has been served by me;<br />
					the Awakened One's bidding,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;done;<br />
					the heavy load,&nbsp;&nbsp;laid down;<br />
					the guide to becoming,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> uprooted.<br />
					And the goal for which I went forth<br />
					from home life into homelessness<br />
					I've reached:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the end<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of all fetters.</p>
