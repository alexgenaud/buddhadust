					<hr />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">In a lowly family I was born,<br />
					poor, with next to no food.<br />
					My work was degrading:<br />
					I gathered the spoiled,<br />
					the withered flowers from shrines<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and threw them away.<br />
					People found me disgusting,<br />
					despised me, disparaged me.<br />
					Lowering my heart,<br />
					I showed reverence to many.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I saw the One Self-awakened,<br />
					arrayed with a squadron of monks,<br />
					the Great Hero, entering the city,<br />
					supreme, of the Magadhans.<br />
					Throwing down my carrying pole,<br />
					I approached him to do reverence.<br />
					He — the supreme man — stood still<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out of sympathy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me.<br />
					After paying homage<br />
					to the feet of the teacher,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood to one side<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&amp; requested the Going Forth from him,<br />
					supreme among all living beings.<br />
					The compassionate Teacher,<br />
					sympathetic to all the world, said:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, monk."<br />
					That was my formal Acceptance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Alone, I stayed in the wilds,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;untiring,<br />
					I followed the Teacher's words,<br />
					just as he, the Conqueror, had taught me.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the first watch of the night,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recollected previous lives;<br />
					in the middle watch,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purified the divine eye;<br />
					in the last,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burst the mass of darkness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as night was ending<br />
					&amp; the sun returning,<br />
					<a id="indra">Indra</a> &amp; <a id="brahma">Brahma</a> came to pay homage to me,<br />
					hands palm-to-palm at their hearts:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Homage to you, O thoroughbred of men,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homage to you, O man supreme,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose effluents are ended.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You, dear sir, are worthy of offerings."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="smile">Seeing me,</a> arrayed with a squadron of devas,<br />
					the Teacher smiled &amp; said:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Through austerity, celibacy,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;restraint, &amp; self-control:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's how one is a brahman.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is a brahman supreme."</p>
