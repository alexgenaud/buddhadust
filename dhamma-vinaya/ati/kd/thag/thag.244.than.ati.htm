					<p class="f4">Since I went forth<br />
					from home into homelessness,<br />
					I haven't known<br />
					an ignoble, aversive resolve.<br />
					"May these beings<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be destroyed,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be slaughtered,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fall into pain" -- <br />
					I've not known this resolve<br />
					in this long, long time.<br />
					But I have known good will,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unlimited,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully developed,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nurtured step after step,<br />
					as taught by the One<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awake:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all, a friend;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to all, a comrade;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for all beings, sympathetic.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					And I develop a mind of good will,<br />
					delighting in non-malevolence — always.<br />
					Unvanquished, unshaken,<br />
					I gladden the mind.<br />
					I develop the sublime abiding,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not frequented by<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the lowly.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="silence">Attaining</a> no-thinking,<br />
					the disciple of the Rightly<br />
					Self-awakened One<br />
					is endowed with noble silence<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straightaway.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="mtn">As a</a> mountain of rock<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is unmoving,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firmly established,<br />
					so a monk, with the ending of delusion,<br />
					like a mountain, doesn't quake.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="storm">To</a> a person without blemish,<br />
					constantly in search of what's pure,<br />
					a hair-tip of evil<br />
					seems a storm cloud.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="fort">As a</a> frontier fortress is guarded<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within and without,<br />
					you should safeguard yourselves.<br />
					Don't let the moment<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pass you by.</p>

					<p class="f4">I don't delight in death,<br />
					don't delight in living.<br />
					I await my time<br />
					like a worker his wage.<br />
					I don't delight in death,<br />
					don't delight in living.<br />
					I await my time<br />
					mindful, alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has been served by me;<br />
					the Awakened One's bidding,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done;<br />
					the heavy load, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laid down;<br />
					the guide to becoming, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; uprooted.<br />
					And the goal for which I went forth<br />
					from home life into homelessness<br />
					I've reached:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the end<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of all fetters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Attain completion through heedfulness:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that is my message.<br />
					So then, I'm about to be<br />
					Unbound.<br />
					I'm released<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> On the development of goodwill as an unlimited attitude, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p21">MN 21</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_42_gamanisamyutta.htm#p8">SN 42:8</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Noble silence = the second jhāna.</p>

The logic of the analogy suggests that if consciousness is not watered by craving, and does not land in any place (see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p64">SN 12:64</a>), it is like a seed without moisture or a field. Therefore it will not sprout into further becoming. Poems in the Canon often describe the arahant as being "everywhere released" (sabbattha vimutto—see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/dhp/idx_dhp.htm#ch24">Dhp 348</a>) or "everywhere independent" (sabbattha anissito—see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp44">Sn 4:6</a>), referring indirectly to this analogy. Translators, lacking a sense of the underlying image of the idiom, have tended to render it in more prosaic terms: "completely released in every respect," "not dependent on anything," "released from everything." However, in light of the field analogy, the idiom means precisely what it says: The arahant is released from every possible "where," whether fabricated or not—every possible spot for renewed becoming.</p>
