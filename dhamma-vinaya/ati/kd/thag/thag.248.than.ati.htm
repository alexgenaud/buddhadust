					<p class="f4"><i>[The bandit chief:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Those who<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the sake of sacrifice<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the sake of wealth<br />
					we have killed in the past,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against their will<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have trembled and babbled<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fear.<br />
					But you — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you show no fear;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your complexion brightens.<br />
					Why don't you lament<br />
					in the face of what's greatly to be feared</p>

					<p class="f4">	<i>[Ven. Adhimutta:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There are no painful mental states, chieftain,<br />
					in one without longing.<br />
					<a id="death1">In one</a> whose fetters are ended,<br />
					all fears are overcome.<br />
					With the ending of [craving]<br />
					the guide to becoming,<br />
					when phenomena are seen<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for what they are,<br />
					then just as in the laying down of a burden,<br />
					there's no fear in death.</p>

					<p class="f4">I've lived well the holy life,<br />
					well-developed the path.<br />
					Death holds no fear for me.<br />
					It's like the end of a disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">I've &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lived well the holy life,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-developed the path,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen states of becoming<br />
					as devoid of allure,<br />
					like poison spit out<br />
					after it's drunk.</p>

					<p class="f4">One gone to the far shore<br />
					without clinging<br />
					without effluent<br />
					his task completed,<br />
					welcomes the ending of life,<br />
					as if freed from a place of execution.<br />
					Having attained the supreme Rightness,<br />
					unsense of compunctioned with all the world,<br />
					as if released from a burning house,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't sorrow at death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever's compounded,<br />
					wherever a state of becoming's obtained,<br />
					all that has no one in charge:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so says the Great Seer.<br />
					Whoever discerns this,<br />
					as taught by the Awakened One,<br />
					would no more grasp hold of any state of becoming<br />
					than he would a hot iron ball.<br />
					I have no 'I was,'<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no 'I will be.'<br />
					Fabrications will simply go out of existence.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What's to lament there in that?<br />
					For one who sees, as it has come to be,<br />
					the pure arising of phenomena,<br />
					the pure seriality of fabrications,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no fear.<br />
					When seeing the world with discernment<br />
					as on a par with grass and twigs,<br />
					finding no 'mineness,'<br />
					thinking, 'There's nothing of mine,'<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he feels no sorrow.<br />
					Dissatisfied with this carcass,<br />
					I'm unsense of compunctioned with becoming.<br />
					This body will break up<br />
					and there will not be another.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do as you like with this carcass.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From that I will feel<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither hatred nor love.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing these awesome, hair-raising words,<br />
					the young men threw down their weapons and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">What have you done, sir,<br />
					or who have you taken as mentor?<br />
					Because of whose teachings<br />
					is this lack of sorrow acquired?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Ven. Adhimutta:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">The &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-knowing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all-seeing conqueror:<br />
					He is my mentor.<br />
					Greatly compassionate teacher,<br />
					all the world's healer,<br />
					this doctrine is his,<br />
					unexcelled, leading to ending.<br />
					Because of his teachings<br />
					is this lack of sorrow acquired.</p>

					<p class="f4">The bandits, hearing the good words of the seer,<br />
					threw down their swords and their weapons.<br />
					Some relinquished their life of crime,<br />
					some chose the Going Forth.<br />
					Having gone forth in the teachings<br />
					of the one well-gone,<br />
					developing the powers and factors for Awakening,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise, happy,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exultant in mind,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their faculties ripened,<br />
					they touched uncompounded Unbinding.</p>
