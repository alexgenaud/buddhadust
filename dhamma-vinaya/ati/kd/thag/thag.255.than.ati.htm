					<p class="f4">[Angulimala:]<br />
					"While walking, contemplative,<br />
					you say, 'I have stopped.'<br />
					But when <i>I</i> have stopped<br />
					you say I haven't.<br />
					I ask you the meaning of this:<br />
					How have you stopped?<br />
					How haven't I?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Buddha:]<br />
					"I have stopped, Angulimala,<br />
					once and for all,<br />
					having cast off violence<br />
					toward all living beings.<br />
					You, though,<br />
					are unrestrained toward beings.<br />
					That's how I've stopped<br />
					and you haven't."</p>

					<p class="f4">[Angulimala:]<br />
					"At long last a greatly revered great seer<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for my sake<br />
					has come to the great forest.<br />
					Having heard your verse<br />
					in line with the Dhamma,<br />
					I will go about<br />
					having abandoned evil."</p>

					<p class="f4">So saying, the bandit<br />
					hurled his sword and weapons<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over a cliff<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into a chasm,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a pit.<br />
					Then the bandit paid homage<br />
					to the feet of the One Well-gone,<br />
					and right there requested the Going-forth.<br />
					The Awakened One,<br />
					the compassionate great seer,<br />
					the teacher of the world, along with its devas,<br />
					said to him then:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Come, bhikkhu."<br />
					That in itself<br />
					was bhikkhuhood for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">His evil-done deed<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					is replaced with skillfulness:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brightens the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the moon set free from a cloud.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever young monk<br />
					devotes himself<br />
					to the Buddha's bidding:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he brightens the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the moon set free from a cloud.</p>

					<p class="f4">May even my enemies<br />

					May even my enemies<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;devote themselves<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Buddha's bidding.<br />
					May even my enemies<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;associate with those people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who &mdash; peaceful, good &mdash;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get others to accept the Dhamma.<br />
					May even my enemies<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hear the Dhamma time and again<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from those who advise&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;endurance,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;forbearance,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who praise non-opposition,<br />
					and may they follow it.</p>

					<p class="f4">For surely he wouldn't harm me,<br />

					he would attain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the foremost peace,<br />

					<p class="f4">Some tame with a blunt stick,<br />
					with hooks, and with whipsv
					But without blunt or bladed weapons<br />
					I was tamed by the one who is Such.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Doer of No Harm" is my name,<br />

					Today I am true to my name,<br />

					<p class="f4">A bandit<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be,<br />

					I went to the Buddha as refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bloody-handed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to be,<br />

					<p class="f4">Having done the type of kamma<br />

					&mdash; dullards, fools &mdash;<br />

					<p class="f4">Don't give way to heedlessness<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />

					<p class="f4">This<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> has come well and not gone away,<br />

					<p class="f4">This has come well and not gone away,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wilderness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the foot of a tree,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in mountains, caves &mdash;<br />
					with ease I now lie down, I stand,<br />
					with ease I live my life.<br />
					O, the Teacher has shown me sympathy!</p>

					<p class="f4">Before, I was of brahman stock,<br />
					on either side high-born.<br />
					Today I'm the son<br />

					the Dhamma-king,<br />

					<p class="f4">Rid of craving, devoid of clinging,<br />
					sense-doors guarded, well-restrained,<br />
					having killed the root of evil,<br />
					I've reached effluents' end.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher has been served by me;<br />
