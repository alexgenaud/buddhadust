					<p><a id="intro"><b>Translator's Introduction</b></a></p>

					<p>This, the first book in the Khuddaka Nikaya (Collection of Short Discourses), appears to have been designed as a primer for novice monks and nuns. In nine short passages it covers the basic topics that one would need to know in beginning Buddhist monastic life; many of the passages also serve as useful introductions to Buddhist practice in general. Passages <a href="#p1">1</a> and <a href="#p2">2</a> cover the ceremony for taking ordination as a novice. Passage <a href="#p3">3</a> gives preliminary guidance in the contemplation of the body, a meditation exercise designed to overcome lust. Passage <a href="#p4">4</a> introduces many of the basic categories of analysis through which discernment can be developed, beginning with the most basic formulation of the causal principle so central to the Buddha's teaching. Passage <a href="#p5">5</a> gives an overview of the practice as a whole — beginning with the need to associate with wise people, and ending with the attainment of Unbinding (Nibbāna/nirvana). This overview is presented in the context of the concept of protective rituals, and makes the point that — given the nature of human action and its results — the best protection comes not from rituals but from acting in a generous, moral, and wise manner. Passage <a href="#p6">6</a> expands both on Passage <a href="#p1">1</a> and Passage <a href="#p5">5</a>, detailing some of the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saŋgha, while at the same time elaborating on the practice of meditation and the attainment of Stream Entry — the point at which the meditator has his/her first glimpse of Unbinding. Passage <a href="#p7">7</a> elaborates on the theme of generosity, showing how gifts to the Saŋgha can be dedicated to the welfare of one's dead relatives. Passage <a href="#p8">8</a> presents meritorious action in general as an investment more reliable and longer-lasting than material investments. Passage <a href="#p9">9</a> returns to the subject of meditation, focusing on the development of good will and lovingkindness.</p>

					<p>These nine passages, in different contexts, are frequently chanted in Theravada countries even today. Lay and ordained Buddhists chant Passage <a href="#p1">1</a> daily, as an affirmation of their refuge in the Triple Gem. Monks will often chant Passages <a href="#p5">5</a>-<a href="#p9">9</a> as blessings when lay people make merit, and frequently use verses from Passage <a href="#p5">5</a> as sermon themes.</p>

					<p>Thus the passages contained in this book serve as a useful introduction both to early Buddhist training and to modern Theravada practices.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is one?</p>

					<p class="f4">All animals subsist on food. [There are these four nutriments for the establishing of beings who have taken birth or for the support of those in search of a place to be born. Which four? Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the second, intellectual intention the third, and consciousness the fourth. — <a href="../../sn/02_nv/sn02.12.064.than.ati.htm">SN XII.64</a>.]</p>

					<p class="f4">What is two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Name and form [mental and physical phenomena].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The three types of feeling [pleasant, painful, neither pleasant nor painful].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four noble truths [stress, the origination of stress, the cessation of stress, the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The five aggregates [form, feeling, perception, fabrications, consciousness].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is six?</p>

					<p class="f4">The six internal sense media [eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, intellect].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The seven factors for Awakening [mindfulness, analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, serenity, concentration, equanimity].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble eightfold path [right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration].</p>

					<p class="f4">What is nine?</p>

					<p class="f4">The nine abodes for beings [seven stations of consciousness and two spheres:</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings with diversity of body and diversity of perception, such as human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings with diversity of body and singularity of perception, such as the devas of the Brahma hosts generated by the first [jhāna]. This is the second station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings with singularity of body and diversity of perception, such as the Radiant Devas. This is the third station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings with singularity of body and singularity of perception, such as the Beautifully Lustrous Devas. This is the fourth station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings who, with the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'Infinite space,' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fifth station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, thinking, 'Infinite consciousness,' arrive at the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the sixth station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings who, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' arrive at the dimension of nothingness. This is the seventh station of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The dimension of non-percipient beings and, second, the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. These are the two spheres. {Maha-nidana Suttanta, <a href="../../dn/dn.15.than.ati.htm">DN 15</a>}]</p>

					<p class="f4">What is ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with ten qualities, one is called an arahant [the right view of one beyond training, the right resolve of one beyond training, the right speech of one beyond training, the right action of one beyond training, the right livelihood of one beyond training, the right effort of one beyond training, the right mindfulness of one beyond training, the right concentration of one beyond training, the right knowledge of one beyond training, the right release of one beyond training {Maha-cattarisaka Sutta, <a href="../../mn/mn.117.than.ati.htm">MN 117</a>}].</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard that at one time the Blessed One was staying in Sāvatthi at Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then a certain deva, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove, approached the Blessed One. On approaching, having bowed down to the Blessed One, she stood to one side. As she stood to one side, she addressed him with a verse.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i>
					Not consorting with fools,<br />

					<p class="f4">Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — on the earth, in the sky — <br />
					may you all be happy<br />
					and listen intently to what I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, spirits, you should all be attentive.<br />
					Show kindness to the human race.<br />
					Day and night they give offerings,<br />
					so, being heedful, protect them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever wealth — here or beyond — <br />
					whatever exquisite treasure in the heavens,<br />
					does not, for us, equal the Tathāgata.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">The exquisite Deathless — ending, dispassion — <br />
					discovered by the Sakyan Sage in concentration:<br />
					There is nothing to equal that Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the excellent Awakened One extolled as pure<br />
					and called the concentration<br />
					of unmediated knowing:<br />
					No equal to that concentration can be found.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">The eight persons — the four pairs — <br />
					praised by those at peace:<br />
					They, disciples of the One Well-Gone, deserve offerings.<br />
					What is given to them bears great fruit.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who, devoted, firm-minded,<br />
					apply themselves to Gotama's message,<br />
					on attaining their goal, plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					freely enjoying the Liberation they've gained.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Indra pillar,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> planted in the earth,<br />
					that even the four winds cannot shake:<br />
					that, I tell you, is like the person of integrity,<br />

					the noble truths — sees.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who have seen clearly the noble truths<br />
					well-taught by the one of deep discernment — <br />
					regardless of what [later] might make them heedless — <br />
					will come to no eighth state of becoming.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the moment of attaining sight,<br />
					one abandons three things:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity-views, uncertainty,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and any attachment to precepts and practices.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					One is completely released<br />
					from the four states of deprivation,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and incapable of committing<br />
					the six great wrongs.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever bad deed one may do<br />
					— in body, speech, or in mind — <br />
					one cannot hide it:<br />
					an incapability ascribed<br />
					to one who has seen the Way.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like a forest grove with flowering tops<br />
					in the first month of the heat of the summer,<br />
					so is the foremost Dhamma he taught,<br />
					for the highest benefit, leading to Unbinding.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Foremost,<br />
					foremost-knowing,<br />
					foremost-giving,<br />
					foremost-bringing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexcelled, he taught the<br />
					foremost Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.<br />
					dispassioned their minds toward further becoming,<br />
					they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no seed, no desire for growth,<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br />

					Such is the kamma of living beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus those who feel sympathy for their dead relatives<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — exquisite, clean — <br />
					[thinking:] "May this be for our relatives.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May our relatives be happy!"</p>

					<p class="f4">And those who have gathered there,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the assembled shades of the relatives,<br />

					They live on what is given here,<br />

					<p class="f4">As water raining on a hill<br />
					flows down to the valley,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so does what is given here<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit the dead.<br />
					As rivers full of water<br />
					fill the ocean full,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so does what is given here<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefit the dead.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He gave to me, she acted on my behalf,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they were my relatives, companions, friends":<br />
					Offerings should be given for the dead<br />
					when one reflects thus<br />

					For no weeping,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no sorrowing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no other lamentation<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefits the dead<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose relatives persist in that way.<br />
					But when this offering is given, well-placed in the Saŋgha,<br />

					<h1><a id="p9">9</a>. Karaniya Metta Sutta — Good Will</h1>

					<p class="f4">This is to be done by one skilled in aims<br />
					who wants to break through to the state of peace:<br />
					Be capable, upright, and straightforward,<br />
					easy to instruct, gentle, and not conceited,<br />
					content and easy to support,<br />
					with few duties, living lightly,<br />
					with peaceful faculties, masterful,<br />
					modest, and no greed for supporters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not do the slightest thing<br />
					that the wise would later censure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think: Happy, at rest,<br />
					may all beings be happy at heart.<br />
					Whatever beings there may be,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak or strong, without exception,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long, large,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; middling, short,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subtle, blatant,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen and unseen,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near and far,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born and seeking birth:<br />
					May all beings be happy at heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let no one deceive another<br />
					or despise anyone anywhere,<br />
					or through anger or resistance<br />
					wish for another to suffer.</p>

					<p class="f4">As a mother would risk her life<br />
					to protect her child, her only child,<br />
					even so should one cultivate a limitless heart<br />
					with regard to all beings.<br />
					With good will for the entire cosmos,<br />
					cultivate a limitless heart:<br />
					Above, below, and all around,<br />
					unobstructed, without hostility or hate.<br />
					Whether standing, walking,<br />
					sitting, or lying down,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as long as one is alert,<br />
					one should be resolved on this mindfulness.<br />
					This is called a sublime abiding<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not taken with views,<br />
					but virtuous and consummate in vision,<br />
					having subdued desire for sensual pleasures,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one never again<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will lie in the womb.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The person who has reached this stage in the practice will be reborn at most seven more times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These three qualities are the fetters abandoned when one gains one's first glimpse of Unbinding at Stream-entry (the moment when one enters the stream to full Awakening).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Four states of deprivation: rebirth as an animal, a hungry shade, an angry demon, or a denizen of hell. In the Buddhist cosmology, none of these states is eternal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The six great wrongs: murdering one's mother, murdering one's father, murdering an Arahant (fully Awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saŋgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one's foremost teacher.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Proper practice of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Clear knowing = knowledge of previous lives, knowledge of the passing away and arising (rebirth) of beings, knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents: sensual passion, becoming, views, ignorance. Release = release from the cycle of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Acumen = acumen with regard to the Dhamma, to its meaning, to language, and to quick-wittedness. These four talents are found in some, but not all, Arahants.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Emancipations. The Maha-nidana Suttanta [<a href="../../dn/dn.15.than.ati.htm">DN 15</a>] describes the eight emancipations as follows:<br />
					"Possessed of form, one sees forms. This is the first emancipation.<br />
					"Not percipient of form internally, one sees forms externally. This is the second emancipation.<br />
					"One is intent only on the beautiful. This is the third emancipation. With the complete transcending of perceptions of [physical] form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, thinking, 'Infinite space,' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space. This is the fourth emancipation. With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, thinking, 'Infinite consciousness,' one enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness. This is the fifth emancipation.<br />
					"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' one enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness. This is the sixth emancipation.<br />
					"With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, one enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. This is the seventh emancipation.<br />
					"With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, one enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling. This is the eighth emancipation.<br />
					"Now, when a monk attains these eight emancipations in forward order, in reverse order, in forward and reverse order, when he attains them and emerges from them wherever he wants, however he wants, and for as long as he wants, when through the ending of the mental effluents he enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known it and realized it in the here and now, he is said to be a monk released in both ways. And as for another release in both ways, higher or more sublime than this, there is none."</p>
