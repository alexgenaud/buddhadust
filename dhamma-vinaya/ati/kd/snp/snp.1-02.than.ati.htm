					<p class="f4">"Free from anger,<br />

					I live for one night<br />

					<p class="f4">"No mosquitoes or gadflies <br />

					The cows range in the marshy meadow <br />

					They could stand the rain if it came:<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go ahead and rain."</p>

					<p class="f4">"My wife is compliant, not careless,<br />

					I hear no evil about her at all:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so if you want, rain-god,<br />

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					No evil is to be found in me:<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so if you want, rain-god,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go ahead and rain."</p>

					<p class="f4">The great cloud rained down <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straightaway,<br />
					filling the lowlands and high.<br />
					Hearing the rain-god pour down,<br />
					Dhaniya said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"How great our gain<br />
					that we've gazed <br />
					on the Blessed One!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We go to him, <br />
					the One with vision, <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for refuge.<br />
					May you be our teacher, Great Sage.<br />
					My wife and I are compliant.<br />
					Let's follow the holy life<br />
					under the One Well-gone.<br />
					Gone to the far shore<br />
					of aging and death,<br />
					let's put an end<br />
					to suffering and stress."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Dhaniya Gopa: Literally, one whose wealth is in cattle. According to the Commentary, his herd consisted of 30,000 head of cattle.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The first line in the Buddha's verse plays on words in the first line of Dhaniya's. "Free from anger" <i>(akkodhano)</i> plays on "rice is cooked" <i>(pakkodano);</i> and "stubbornness"<i> (khilo)</i> plays on "milk"<i> (khiro).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is also used in <a href="../ud/ud.5-05.than.ati.htm">Ud V.5</a> and <a href="snp.4-04.than.ati.htm">Sn IV.4</a>. "My fire out" refers to the fires of passion, aversion, and delusion; birth, aging, and death; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. See <a href="../../sn/04_salv/sn04.35.028.than.ati.htm">SN XXXV.28</a>; <a href="../iti/iti.3.than.ati.htm#p93">Iti 93</a>; and <i><a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/index.html">The Mind Like Fire Unbound</a>.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The raft stands for the noble eightfold path. See passages <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html">113</a> and <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/wings/part2.html">114</a> in <i>The Wings to Awakening.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> As this verse doesn't seem to be a direct response to the preceding one, the Commentary suggests that we are missing part of the conversation here. An alternative possibility is that the Buddha is engaging in word play -- the word "crossed over" <i>(tinna)</i> being a pun on Dhaniya's reference to grass<i> (tina).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, the Buddha is not in anyone else's employ nor even in his own employ -- i.e., he is not in the employ of craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The Buddha may be speaking literally here -- he has no cattle, so there is no way that a heavy rain could cause him harm -- but he may also be speaking metaphorically. See <a href="../../sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.019.than.ati.htm">SN IV.19</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, Mara suddenly comes on the scene to try -- unsuccessfully -- to prevent Dhaniya and his wife from going forth. His verses here, together with the Buddha's response, are also found at <a href="../../sn/01_sagv/sn01.04.008.than.ati.htm">SN IV.8</a>.</p>
