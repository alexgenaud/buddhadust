					<p><b>Translator's note:</b></p>

					<p>A comparative study among the records of various early Buddhist schools suggests that the verses here, like those in <a href="snp.1-03.than.ati.htm">I.3</a>, were originally separate poems, spoken on separate occasions, and that they have been gathered together because they share the same refrain.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monk seeing<br />
