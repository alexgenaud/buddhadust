					for he has gone &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beyond.</p>

					<p class="f4">Overcoming all<br />

					<p class="f4">These two are different,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Dangers in intimacy:</i> Craving and views.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Dust:</i> Passion, aversion, and delusion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Ground, seed, and sap:</i> The khandhas (body, feelings, perceptions, thought formations, and consciousness), sense spheres, and elements form the ground in which grows the seed of constructive consciousness -- the consciousness that develops into states of being and birth. The sap of this seed is craving and views.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <i>Dwellings:</i> States of becoming and birth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> <i>He does not build:</i> He performs none of the good or bad deeds that give rise to further states of becoming and birth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <i>No effluents</i> <i>(asava)</i>: He has none of the forms of defilement -- sensual desire, views, states of becoming, or ignorance -- that "flow out" of the mind and give rise to the flood of the cycle of death and rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> <i>The pillar at a bathing ford:</i> The Cullavagga (V.l) describes this as an immovable pillar, standing quite tall and buried deep in the ground near a bathing place, against which young villagers and boxers would rub their bodies while bathing so as to toughen them. The "extremes" in which others speak, according to the Commentary, are extremes of praise and criticism: These leave the sage, like the pillar, unmoved.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Straight as a shuttle:</i> Having a mind unprejudiced by favoritism, dislike, delusion, or fear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> <i>On-pitch and off (sama and visama):</i> Throughout ancient cultures, the terminology of music was used to describe the moral quality of people and acts. Discordant intervals or poorly-tuned musical instruments were metaphors for evil; harmonious intervals and well-tuned instruments were metaphors for good. In Pali, the term sama -- "even" -- described an instrument tuned on-pitch: There is a <a href="../../an/06_sixes/an06.055.than.ati.htm">famous passage</a> where the Buddha reminds Sona Kolivisa -- who had been over-exerting himself in the practice -- that a lute sounds appealing only if the strings are neither too taut or too lax, but 'evenly' tuned. This image would have special resonances with the Buddha's teaching on the middle way. It also adds meaning to the term <i>samana</i> -- monk or contemplative -- which the texts frequently mention as being derived from <i>sama.</i> The word <i>samañña</i> -- "evenness," the quality of being in tune -- also means the quality of being a contemplative. This concept plays an important role in the Instructions to Rāhula, below. The true contemplative is always in tune with what is proper and good.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> <i>Intoxication:</i> The three intoxications are intoxication with youth, with good health, and with life.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <i>Ocean:</i> The way defilement splashes into undesirable destinations (so says the Commentary).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <i>Flood:</i> The flow of defilement: sensual desires, views, states of becoming, and ignorance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Such:</i> Unchanging; unaffected by anything.</p>
