					<p class="f4">This is to be done by one skilled in aims<br />
					who wants to break through to the state of peace:<br />
					Be capable, upright, and straightforward,<br />
					easy to instruct, gentle, and not conceited,<br />
					content and easy to support,<br />
					with few duties, living lightly,<br />
					with peaceful faculties, masterful,<br />
					modest, and no greed for supporters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Do not do the slightest thing<br />
					that the wise would later censure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Think: Happy, at rest,<br />
					may all beings be happy at heart.<br />
					Whatever beings there may be,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weak or strong, without exception,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; long, large,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; middling, short,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subtle, blatant,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seen and unseen,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near and far,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born and seeking birth:<br />
					May all beings be happy at heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let no one deceive another<br />
					or despise anyone anywhere,<br />
					or through anger or irritation<br />
					wish for another to suffer.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="mother">As a mother</a> would risk her life<br />
					to protect her child, her only child,<br />
					even so should one cultivate a limitless heart<br />
					with regard to all beings.<br />
					With good will for the entire cosmos,<br />
					cultivate a limitless heart:<br />
					Above, below, and all around,<br />
					unobstructed, without enmity or hate.<br />
					Whether standing, walking,<br />
					sitting, or lying down,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as long as one is alert,<br />
					one should be resolved on this mindfulness.<br />
					This is called a sublime abiding<br />
					here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not taken with views,<br />
					but virtuous and consummate in vision,<br />
					having subdued desire for sensual pleasures,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one never again<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will lie in the womb.</p>
