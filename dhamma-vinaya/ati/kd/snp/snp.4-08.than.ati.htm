					<p class="f4">"Only here is there purity"<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- that's what they say -- <br />
					"No other doctrines are pure"<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so they say.<br />
					Insisting that what they depend on is good,<br />
					they are deeply entrenched in their personal truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeking controversy, they plunge into an assembly,<br />
					regarding one another as fools.<br />
					Relying on others' authority,<br />
					they speak in debate.<br />
					Desiring praise, they claim to be skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Engaged in disputes in the midst of the assembly,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- anxious, desiring praise -- <br />
					the one defeated is<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chagrined.<br />
					Shaken with criticism, he seeks for an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">He whose doctrine is [judged as] demolished,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; defeated, by those judging the issue:<br />
					He laments, he grieves -- the inferior exponent.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He beat me," he mourns.</p>

					<p class="f4">These disputes have arisen among contemplatives.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In them are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elation,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dejection.<br />
					Seeing this, one should abstain from disputes,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for they have no other goal<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the gaining of praise.</p>

					<p class="f4">He who is praised there<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for expounding his doctrine<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the midst of the assembly,<br />
					laughs on that account and grows haughty,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attaining his heart's desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">That haughtiness will be his grounds for vexation,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for he'll speak in pride and conceit.<br />
					Seeing this, one should abstain from debates.<br />
					No purity is attained by them, say the skilled.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="strong">Like a</a> strong man nourished on royal food,<br />
					you go about, roaring, searching out an opponent.<br />
					Wherever the battle is,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go there, strong man.<br />
					As before, there's none here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who dispute, taking hold of a view,<br />
					saying, "This, and this only, is true,"<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those you can talk to.<br />
					Here there is nothing -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no confrontation<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the birth of disputes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Among those who live above confrontation<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not pitting view against view,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whom would you gain as opponent, Pasura,<br />
					among those here<br />
					who are grasping no more?</p>

					<p class="f4">So here you come,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conjecturing,<br />
					your mind conjuring<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; viewpoints.<br />
					You're paired off with a pure one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so cannot proceed.</p>
