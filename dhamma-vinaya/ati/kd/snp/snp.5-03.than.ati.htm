					<p class="f4"><i>Punnaka:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">To the one unperturbed,<br />
					who has seen the root [of all things],<br />
					I have come with a question.<br />
					Because of what<br />
					have many human seers<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br />
					offered sacrifices to devas<br />
					here in the world?<br />
					I ask you, O Blessed One.<br />
					Please tell me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Those many human seers<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br />
					who have offered sacrifices to devas<br />
					here in the world, Punnaka,<br />
					hoping for more of this state of being,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; offered their sacrifices<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; because of aging.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Punnaka:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Those many human seers<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- noble warriors, brahmans -- <br />
					who have offered sacrifices to devas<br />
					here in the world:<br />
					Have they, O Blessed One,<br />
					heeding the path of sacrifice,<br />
					crossed over birth and aging?<br />
					I ask you, O Blessed One.<br />
					Please tell me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">They hoped for, liked,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longed for,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so sacrificed -- <br />
					they longed for sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on gain.<br />
					I tell you:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those who take on the yoke<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of sacrifice,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impassioned with<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the passion for becoming,<br />
					have not crossed over birth and aging.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Punnaka:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">If those who take on the yoke of sacrifice<br />
					haven't crossed over the flood, dear sir,<br />
					then who in the world<br />
					of beings divine and human<br />
					has crossed over birth and aging?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask you, O Blessed One.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">He who has fathomed<br />
					the far and near in the world,<br />
					for whom there is nothing<br />
					perturbing in the world -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his vices evaporated,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undesiring, untroubled,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at peace -- <br />
					he, I tell you, has crossed over birth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and aging.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> AN III.32 and <a href="../../an/04_fours/an04.041.than.ati.htm">AN IV.41</a> contain discussions of the last verse in this poem.</p>

					<p>In AN III.32, Ven. Ānanda asks the Buddha, "Could it be that a monk could attain a concentration of such a sort such that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, such that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit, and that he would enter and remain in the awareness-release and discernment-release in which there is no 'I'-making or 'mine'-making or obsession of conceit?"</p>

					<p>The Buddha answers that it is possible, and that such a concentration can be attained when one is percipient in this way: "This is peace, this is exquisite -- the resolution of all mental processes; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; Unbinding." He then adds that it was in connection to this state of mind that he uttered the last verse in this poem.</p>

					<p>In <a href="../../an/04_fours/an04.041.than.ati.htm">AN IV.41</a>, the Buddha identifies four ways of developing concentration: "There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to a pleasant abiding in the here and now. There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to the attainment of knowledge and vision. There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to mindfulness and alertness. There is the development of concentration that, when developed and pursued, leads to the ending of the effluents." (For details, see <a href="../../an/04_fours/an04.041.than.ati.htm">AN IV.41</a>) The Buddha then adds that he uttered the last verse of this poem in connection with these four ways of developing concentration.</p>
