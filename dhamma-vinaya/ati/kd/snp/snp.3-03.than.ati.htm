					<p class="f4">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in <a id="savatthi">Sāvatthi</a> at Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha">Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery</a>. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said: "Monks, speech endowed with four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken -- faultless and not to be faulted by the wise. Which four? There is the case where a monk says only what it well-spoken, not what is poorly spoken; only what is just, not what is unjust; only what is endearing, not what is unendearing; only what is true, not what is false. Speech endowed with these four characteristics is well-spoken, not poorly spoken -- faultless and not to be faulted by the wise."</p>
					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4">The calm say that what is well-spoken is best;<br />
					second, that one should say<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is just, not unjust;<br />
					third, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's endearing, not unendearing;<br />
					fourth, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what is true, not false.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="vangisa">Ven. Vangisa</a>, rising from his seat, arranging his robe over one shoulder, faced the Blessed One with his hands palm-to-palm in front of his heart and said, "An inspiration has come to me, Blessed One! An inspiration has come to me, One Well-Gone!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let the inspiration come to you, Vangisa," the Blessed One said.</p>
					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Vangisa praised the Blessed One to his face with these attractive verses:</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak only the speech<br />
					that neither torments self<br />
					nor does harm to others.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That speech is truly well spoken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Speak only endearing speech,<br />
					speech that is welcomed.<br />
					Speech when it brings no evil<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to others<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is pleasant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Truth, indeed, is deathless speech:<br />
					This is an ancient principle.<br />
					The goal and the Dhamma<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- so say the calm -- <br />
					are firmly established on truth.</p>

					<p class="f4">The speech the Awakened One speaks,<br />
					for attaining Unbinding,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rest,<br />
					for making an end<br />
					to the mass of stress:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That is the speech unexcelled.
