					<p class="f4">I will describe the Going Forth,<br />
					how he, the One-with-Vision, went forth,<br />
					how he reasoned and chose the Going Forth.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<a id="household">Household</a> life is crowded,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a realm of dust,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while going forth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the open air."<br />
					Seeing this, he went forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">On going forth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he avoided evil deeds in body.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abandoning verbal misconduct,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he purified his livelihood.<br />
					Then he, the Buddha, went to <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a>,<br />
					the mountain fortress of the <a id="magadhans">Magadhans</a>,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wandered for alms,<br />
					endowed with all the foremost marks.<br />
					<a id="bimbisara">King Bimbisara</a>, standing in his palace, saw him,<br />
					and on seeing him, consummate in marks,<br />
					said: "Look at this one, sirs.<br />
					How handsome, stately, pure!<br />
					How consummate his demeanor!<br />
					Mindful, his eyes downcast,<br />
					looking only a plow-length before him,<br />
					as one who's not from a lowly lineage:<br />
					Send the royal messengers at once<br />
					to see where this monk will go."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="whereto">They</a> -- the messengers dispatched -- <br />
					followed behind him.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where will this monk go?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where will his dwelling place be?"<br />
					As he went from house to house -- <br />
					well-restrained, his sense-doors guarded,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful, alert -- <br />
					his bowl filled quickly.<br />
					Then he, the sage, completing his alms round,<br />
					left the city, headed for <a id="pandava">Mount Pandava</a>.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's where his dwelling will be."<br />
					Seeing him go to his dwelling place,<br />
					three messengers sat down,<br />
					while one returned to tell the king.<br />
					"That monk, your majesty,<br />
					on the flank of Pandava,<br />
					sits like a tiger, a bull,<br />
					<a id="lion">a lion</a> in a mountain cleft."</p>

					<p class="f4">Hearing the messenger's words,<br />
					the noble warrior king<br />
					straight away went by royal coach,<br />
					out to Mount Pandava.<br />
					Going as far as the coach would go,<br />
					he got down, went up on foot,<br />
					and on arrival sat down.<br />
					Sitting there,<br />
					he exchanged courteous greetings,<br />
					then said:<br />
					"You are young, youthful,<br />
					in the first stage of youth,<br />
					endowed with the stature and coloring<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a noble-warrior.<br />
					You would look glorious<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the vanguard of an army,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; arrayed with an elephant squadron.<br />
					I offer you wealth : enjoy it.<br />
					I ask your birth : inform me."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Straight ahead, your majesty,<br />
					by the foothills of the <a id="himalayas">Himalayas</a>,<br />
					is a country consummate<br />
					in energy and wealth,<br />
					inhabited by <a id="kosalans">Kosalans</a>:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Solar by clan,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sakyans by birth.<br />
					From that lineage I have gone forth,<br />
					but not in search of sensual pleasures.<br />
					Seeing the danger in sensual pleasures<br />
					-- and renunciation as rest -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I go to strive.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That's where my heart delights."
