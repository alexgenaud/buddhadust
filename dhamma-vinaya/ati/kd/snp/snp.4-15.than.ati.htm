					<p class="f4">"When embraced,<br />
					the rod of violence<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; breeds danger and fear:<br />
					Look at people quarreling.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will tell of how<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I experienced<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dismay.<br />
					<a id="fish">Seeing</a> people floundering<br />
					like fish in small puddles,<br />
					competing with one another -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as I saw this,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fear came into me.<br />
					The world was entirely<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without substance.<br />
					All the directions<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; were knocked out of line.<br />
					Wanting a haven for myself,<br />
					I saw nothing that wasn't laid claim to.<br />
					Seeing nothing in the end<br />
					but competition,<br />
					I felt discontent.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a id="arrow">And then I saw</a><br />
					an arrow here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so very hard to see,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; embedded in the heart.<br />
					Overcome by this arrow<br />
					you run in all directions.<br />
					But simply on pulling it out<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't run,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you don't sink.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><i>[Here the trainings are recited.]</i></span><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever things are tied down in the world,<br />
					you shouldn't be set on them.<br />
					Having totally penetrated<br />
					sensual pleasures,<br />
					sensual passions,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					you should train for your own<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding.<br />
					Be truthful, not insolent,<br />
					not deceptive, rid<br />
					of divisiveness.<br />
					Without anger, the sage<br />
					should cross over the evil<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of greed and avarice.<br />
					He should conquer laziness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; weariness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sloth;<br />
					shouldn't consort with heedlessness,<br />
					shouldn't stand firm in his pride -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the man with his heart set<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on Unbinding.<br />
					He shouldn't engage in lying,<br />
					shouldn't create a sense of allure in form,<br />
					should fully fathom conceit,<br />
					and live refraining from impulsiveness;<br />
					shouldn't &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delight in what's old,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prefer what's new,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grieve over decline,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; get entangled in<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's dazzling and bright.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I call greed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a 'great flood';<br />
					hunger, a swift current.<br />
					Preoccupations are ripples;<br />
					sensuality, a bog<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to cross over.<br />
					Not deviating from truth,<br />
					a sage stands on high ground<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having renounced All,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
					he is said to be at peace;<br />
					having clearly known, he<br />
					is an attainer-of-wisdom;<br />
					knowing the Dhamma, he's<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; independent.<br />
					Moving rightly through the world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he doesn't envy<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anyone here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever here has gone over and beyond<br />
					sensual passions -- <br />
					an attachment hard<br />
					to transcend in the world,<br />
					doesn't sorrow,<br />
					doesn't fret.<br />
					He, his stream cut, is free<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4">Burn up what's <i>before,</i><br />
					and have nothing for <i>after.</i><br />
					If you don't grasp<br />
					at what's <i>in between,</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you will go about, calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">For whom, in name and form,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in every way,<br />
					there's no sense of <i>mine,</i><br />
					and who doesn't grieve<br />
					over what is not:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he, in the world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; isn't defeated,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffers no loss.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">To whom there doesn't occur<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This is mine,'<br />
					for whom nothing is others',<br />
					feeling no sense of <i>mineness,</i><br />
					doesn't grieve at the thought<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I have nothing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Not harsh,<br />
					not greedy, not<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perturbed,<br />everywhere<br />
					in tune:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the reward<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- I say when asked -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for those who are free<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from pre-<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conceptions.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one unperturbed<br />
					-- who knows -- <br />
					there's no accumulating.<br />
					Abstaining, unaroused,<br />
					he everywhere sees<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; security.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sage<br />
					doesn't speak of himself<br />
					as among those who are higher,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal,<br />
					or lower.<br />
					At peace, free of selfishness,<br />
					he doesn't embrace, doesn't<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reject,"</p>
