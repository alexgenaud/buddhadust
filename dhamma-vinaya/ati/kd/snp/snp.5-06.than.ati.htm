					<p class="f4">Alone, Sakyan, and with nothing to rely on,<br />
					I can't venture across<br />
					the great flood.<br />
					Tell me, All-around Eye,<br />
					the support to rely on<br />

					<p class="f4">Mindfully focused on nothingness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					relying on 'There isn't,'<br />

					Abandoning sensual pleasures,<br />
					abstaining from conversations,<br />
					keep watch for the ending of<br />
					craving, night and day.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Upasiva:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">One free from passion<br />
					for all sensual pleasures<br />
					relying on nothingness, letting go of all else,<br />
					released in the highest emancipation of perception:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he stay there unaffected?</p>

					<p class="f4">If he stays there, O All-around Eye,<br />
					unaffected for many years,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right there<br />
					would he be cooled and released?<br />
					Would his consciousness be like that?</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Nothingness" here denotes the dimension of nothingness, one of the four levels of mental absorption on formless themes. One attains this level, after surmounting the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, by focusing on the perception, "There is nothing." MN 26 tells us that Alara Kalama, the Buddha's first teacher when the latter was still a Bodhisatta, had attained this level of mental absorption and had thought that it was the highest possible attainment. The Bodhisatta left him upon realizing that it was not true liberation from stress and suffering. Nevertheless, the dimension of nothingness can be used as a basis for the insight leading to that liberation. On this point, see <a href="snp.5-14.than.ati.htm">Sn.V.14</a> and <a href="../../an/09_nines/an09.036.than.ati.htm">AN IX.36.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> For a discussion of the meaning of "criterion" in this passage, see <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html"><i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> Chapter 1</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Although Upasiva refers to the goal as a phenomenon (dhamma), the Buddha describes it as the transcending of all phenomena. For some of the implications of this statement, see <a href="../../an/03_threes/an03.134.than.ati.htm">AN III.134</a>.</p>
