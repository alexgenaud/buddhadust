					<p class="f4">There are some who dispute<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corrupted at heart,<br />
					and those who dispute<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their hearts set on truth,<br />
					but a sage doesn't enter<br />
					a dispute that's arisen,<br />
					which is why he is<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nowhere constrained.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, how would one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; led on by desire,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenched in his likes,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; forming his own conclusions,<br />
					overcome his own views?<br />
					He'd dispute in line<br />
					with the way that he knows.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever boasts to others, unasked,<br />
					of his practices, precepts,<br />
					is, say the skilled,<br />
					ignoble by nature -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who speaks of himself<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of his own accord.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a monk at peace,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fully unbound in himself,<br />
					who doesn't boast of his precepts<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- "That's how I am" -- <br />
					<i>he, </i>say the skilled,<br />
					is noble by nature -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he with no vanity<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with regard to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">One whose doctrines aren't clean -- <br />
					fabricated, formed, given preference<br />
					when he sees it to his own advantage -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relies on a peace<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on what can be shaken.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because entrenchments<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in views<br />
					aren't easily overcome<br />
					when considering what's grasped<br />
					among doctrines,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that's why<br />
					a person embraces or rejects a doctrine -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in light of these very<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; entrenchments.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, one who is cleansed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has no preconceived view<br />
					about states of becoming<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or not-<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere in the world.<br />
					Having abandoned conceit<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> and illusion,<br />
					by what means would he go?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He isn't involved.</p>

					<p class="f4">For one who's involved<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets into disputes<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over doctrines,<br />
					but how -- in connection with what<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> -- <br />
					would you argue<br />
					with one uninvolved?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has nothing<br />
					embraced or rejected,<br />
					has sloughed off every view<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here -- every one.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Entrenchments: a rendering of the Pali term, <i>nivesana,</i> which can also be rendered as abode, situation, home, or establishment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Nd.I: Cleansed through discernment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Nd.I explains a variety of ways of understanding the word "conceit," the most comprehensive being a list of nine kinds of conceit: viewing people better than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people on a par with oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself; viewing people worse than oneself as worse than oneself, on a par with oneself, or better than oneself. In other words, the truth of the view is not the issue here; the issue is the tendency to compare oneself with others.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "By what means would he go" to any destination in any state of becoming.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In connection with what: a rendering of the instrumental case that attempts to cover several of its meanings, in particular "by what means" and "in terms of what." For a discussion of the use of the instrumental case in the Atthaka Vagga, see <a href="snp.4-09.than.ati.htm#n9-1">note 1 to Sn IV.9</a>.</p>
