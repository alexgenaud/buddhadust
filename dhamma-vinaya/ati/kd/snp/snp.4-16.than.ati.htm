					<p class="f4">"Never before<br />
					have I seen or heard<br />
					from anyone<br />
					of a teacher with such lovely speech<br />
					come, together with his following<br />
					from Tusita heaven,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					as the One with Eyes<br />
					who appears to the world with its devas<br />
					having dispelled all darkness<br />
					having arrived at delight<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">To that One Awakened -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unentangled, Such, un-<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deceptive,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; come with his following -- <br />
					I have come with a question<br />
					on behalf of the many<br />
					here who are fettered.<br />
					For a monk disaffected,<br />
					frequenting a place that's remote -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the root of a tree,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a cemetery,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in mountain caves<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; various places to stay -- <br />
					how many are the fears there<br />
					at which he shouldn't tremble<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- there in his noiseless abode -- <br />
					how many the dangers in the world<br />
					for the monk &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; going the direction<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he never has gone<br />
					that he should transcend<br />
					there in his isolated abode?<br />
					What should be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ways of his speech?<br />
					What should be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his range there of action?<br />
					What should be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a resolute monk's<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts and practices?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					<a id="silver">Undertaking</a> what training<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- alone, astute, and mindful -- <br />
					would he blow away<br />
					his own impurities<br />
					as a silver smith,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those in molten silver?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"I will tell you<br />
					as one who knows,<br />
					what is comfort<br />
					for one disaffected<br />
					resorting to a remote place,<br />
					desiring self-awakening<br />
					in line with the Dhamma.<br />
					An enlightened monk,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living circumscribed,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful,<br />
					shouldn't fear the five fears:<br />
					of horseflies, mosquitoes, snakes,<br />
					human contact, four-footed beings;<br />
					shouldn't be disturbed<br />
					by those following another's teaching<br />
					even on seeing their manifold<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; terrors;<br />
					should overcome still other<br />
					further dangers<br />
					as he seeks what is skillful.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touched<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by the touch<br />
					of discomforts, hunger,<br />
					he should endure cold<br />
					and inordinate heat.<br />
					He with no home,<br />
					in many ways touched by these things,<br />
					striving, should make firm his persistence.</p>

					<p class="f4">He shouldn't commit a theft,<br />
					shouldn't speak a lie,<br />
					should touch with thoughts of good will<br />
					beings firm and infirm.<br />
					Conscious of when<br />
					his mind is stirred up and turbid,<br />
					he should dispel it:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'It's on the Dark One's side.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He shouldn't come under the sway<br />
					of anger or pride.<br />
					Having dug up their root<br />
					he would stand firm.<br />
					Then, when prevailing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- yes -- <br />
					he'd prevail over his sense of dear and undear.<br />
					Yearning &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for discernment<br />
					enraptured &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with what's admirable,<br />
					he should overcome these dangers,<br />
					should conquer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discontent<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in his isolated spot,<br />
					should conquer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these four<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thoughts of lament:</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'What will I eat,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or where will I eat.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How badly I slept.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tonight where will I sleep?'</p>

					<p class="f4">These lamenting thoughts<br />
					he should subdue -- <br />
					one under training,<br />
					wandering without home.<br />
					Receiving food and cloth<br />
					at appropriate times,<br />
					he should have a sense of enough<br />
					for the sake of contentment.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Guarded in regard to these things<br />
					going restrained into a village,<br />
					even when harassed<br />
					he shouldn't say a harsh word.</p>

					<p class="f4">With eyes downcast,<br />
					and not footloose,<br />
					committed to jhāna,<br />
					he should be continually wakeful.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Strengthening equanimity,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; centered within,<br />
					he should cut off any penchant<br />
					to conjecture or worry.<br />
					When reprimanded,<br />
					he should -- mindful -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rejoice;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					should smash any stubbornness<br />
					toward his fellows in the holy life;<br />
					should utter skillful words<br />
					that are not untimely;<br />
					should give no mind<br />
					to the gossip people might say.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then there are in the world<br />
					the five kinds of dust<br />
					for whose dispelling, mindful<br />
					he should train:<br />
					with regard to forms, sounds, tastes,<br />
					smells, and tactile sensations<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should conquer passion;<br />
					with regard to these things<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should subdue his desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk, mindful,<br />
					his mind well-released,<br />
					contemplating the right Dhamma<br />
					at the right times,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on coming<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to oneness<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should annihilate<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; darkness,"<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Buddha spent his next-to-last lifetime in the Tusita heaven, one of the highest levels on the sensual plane.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The fact that the Buddha answers this question in a straightforward manner illustrates the point that abandoning precepts and practices does not mean having no precepts and practices.
