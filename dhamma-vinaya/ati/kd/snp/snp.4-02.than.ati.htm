					<p class="f4">Staying attached to the cave,<br />
					covered heavily over,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					a person sunk in confusion<br />
					is far from seclusion -- <br />
					for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual pleasures<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual desires<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					in the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are not lightly let go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those chained by desire,<br />
					bound by becoming's allure,<br />
					aren't easily released<br />
					for there's no liberation by others.<br />
					Intent, in front or behind,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					on hunger for sensual pleasures<br />
					here or before -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; greedy<br />
					for sensual pleasures,<br />
					busy, deluded, ungenerous,<br />
					entrenched in the out-of-tune way,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					they -- impelled into pain -- lament:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What will we be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when we pass on from here?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So a person should train<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right here and now.<br />
					Whatever you know<br />
					as out-of-tune in the world,<br />
					don't, for its sake, act out-of-tune,<br />
					for that life, the enlightened say,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is short.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I see them,<br />
					in the world, floundering around,<br />
					people immersed in craving<br />
					for states of becoming.<br />
					Base people moan in the mouth of death,<br />
					their craving, for states of becoming and not-,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unallayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See them,<br />
					floundering in their sense of <i>mine,</i><br />
					<a id="fish">like fish</a> in the puddles<br />
					of a dried-up stream -- <br />
					and, seeing this,<br />
					live with no <i>mine,</i><br />
					not forming attachment<br />
					for states of becoming.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subdue desire<br />
					for both sides,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
					comprehending<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> sensory contact,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no greed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Doing nothing for which<br />
					he himself<br />
					would rebuke himself,<br />
					the enlightened person doesn't adhere<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's seen,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to what's heard.<br />
					Comprehending perception,<br />
					he'd cross over the flood -- <br />
					the sage not stuck<br />
					on possessions.<br />
					Then, with arrow removed,<br />
					living heedfully, he longs for neither -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "Covered heavily over" with defilements and unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> "Sensual desires/sensual pleasures": two possible meanings of <i>kama.</i> According to Nd.I, both meanings are intended here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "In front" means experienced in the past (as does "before" two lines down); "behind" means to-be-experienced in the future.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "The out-of-tune way" means the ten types of unskillful action (see <a href="../../an/10_tens/an10.176.than.ati.htm">AN X.176</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> States of not-becoming are oblivious states of becoming that people can get themselves into through a desire for annihilation, either after death or as a goal of their religious striving (see <a href="../iti/iti.2.than.ati.htm#p49">Iti 49</a>). As with all states of becoming, these states are impermanent and stressful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> According to Nd.I, "both sides" here has several possible meanings: sensory contact and the origination of sensory contact; past and future; name and form; internal and external sense media; self-identity and the origination of self-identity. It also might mean states of becoming and not-becoming, mentioned in the previous verse and below, in <a href="snp.4-05.than.ati.htm">Sn IV.5</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Nd.I: Comprehending sensory contact has three aspects: being able to identify and distinguish types of sensory contact; contemplating the true nature of sensory contact (e.g., inconstant, stressful, and not-self); and abandoning attachment to sensory contact. The same three aspects would apply to comprehending perception, as mentioned in the following verse.</p>
