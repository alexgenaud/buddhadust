					<p class="f4">Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- on the earth, in the sky -- <br />
					may you all be happy<br />
					and listen intently to what I say.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, spirits, you should all be attentive.<br />
					Show kindness to the human race.<br />
					Day and night they give offerings,<br />
					so, being heedful, protect them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever wealth -- here or beyond -- <br />
					whatever exquisite treasure in the heavens,<br />
					does not, for us, equal the Tathāgata.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">The exquisite Deathless -- ending, dispassion -- <br />
					discovered by the Sakyan Sage in concentration:<br />
					There is nothing to equal that Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">What the excellent Awakened One extolled as pure<br />
					and called the concentration<br />
					of unmediated knowing:<br />
					No equal to that concentration can be found.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">The <a id="p8persons">eight persons</a> -- the four pairs -- <br />
					praised by those at peace:<br />
					They, disciples of the One Well-Gone, deserve offerings.<br />
					What is given to them bears great fruit.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who, devoted, firm-minded,<br />
					apply themselves to Gotama's message,<br />
					on attaining their goal, plunge into the Deathless,<br />
					freely enjoying the Liberation they've gained.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">An Indra pillar,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> planted in the earth,<br />
					that even the four winds cannot shake:<br />
					that, I tell you, is like the person of integrity,<br />
					who -- having comprehended<br />
					the noble truths -- sees.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who have seen clearly the noble truths<br />
					well-taught by the one of deep discernment -- <br />
					regardless of what [later] might make them heedless -- <br />
					will come to no eighth state of becoming.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the moment of attaining sight,<br />
					one abandons three things:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identity-views, uncertainty,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and any attachment to precepts and practices.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					One is completely released<br />
					from the four states of deprivation,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					and incapable of committing<br />
					the six great wrongs.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever bad deed one may do<br />
					-- in body, speech, or in mind -- <br />
					one cannot hide it:<br />
					an incapability ascribed<br />
					to one who has seen the Way.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="forest">Like a</a> forest grove with flowering tops<br />
					in the first month of the heat of the summer,<br />
					so is the foremost Dhamma he taught,<br />
					for the highest benefit, leading to Unbinding.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Foremost,<br />
					foremost-knowing,<br />
					foremost-giving,<br />
					foremost-bringing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexcelled, he taught the<br />
					foremost Dhamma.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Buddha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ended the old, there is no new taking birth.<br />
					dispassioned their minds toward further becoming,<br />
					they, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with no seed, no desire for growth,<br />
					the prudent, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go out like this flame.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Saŋgha.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this truth may there be well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- on the earth, in the sky -- <br />
					let us pay homage to the Buddha,<br />
					the Tathāgata worshipped by beings<br />
					human and divine.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May there be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-being.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever spirits have gathered here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- on the earth, in the sky -- <br />
					let us pay homage to the Dhamma<br />
					and the Tathāgata worshipped by beings<br />
					human and divine.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May there be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well-being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Indra-pillar: A tall hardwood pillar, planted at the entrance to a village.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The person who has reached this stage in the practice will be reborn at most seven more times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These three qualities are the fetters abandoned when one gains one's first glimpse of Unbinding at Stream-entry (the moment when one enters the stream to full Awakening).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Four states of deprivation: rebirth as an animal, a hungry shade, an angry demon, or a denizen of hell. In the Buddhist cosmology, none of these states is eternal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The six great wrongs: murdering one's mother, murdering one's father, murdering an Arahant (fully Awakened individual), wounding a Buddha, causing a schism in the Saŋgha, or choosing anyone other than a Buddha as one's foremost teacher.</p>
