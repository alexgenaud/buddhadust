					<p class="f4"><i>Mettagu:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I ask you, O Blessed One.<br />
					Please tell me.<br />
					I regard you as knowledgeable,<br />
					with your self developed.<br />
					From what have the many<br />
					forms of stress and suffering<br />
					arisen in the world?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ask me<br />
					the coming-into-being<br />
					of stress and suffering,<br />
					I will tell it to you<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as one who discerns.<br />
					From acquisition<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> as cause<br />
					the many forms of stress and suffering<br />
					come into being in the world.<br />
					Whoever, unknowing, makes acquisitions<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- the fool -- <br />
					comes to stress and suffering<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and again.</p>

					<p class="f4">So one who's discerning,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; focused on the birth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of stress and suffering,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their coming-into-being,<br />
					should make no acquisitions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mettagu:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">What we asked, you've expounded.<br />
					Now we ask something else.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell us.<br />
					How do the prudent<br />
					cross over the flood of<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; birth and aging,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamentation and sorrow?<br />
					Please, sage, declare this to me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as this Dhamma has<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; been known by you.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Dhamma<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- in the here and now,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not quoted words -- <br />
					knowing which, living mindfully,<br />
					you'll cross over beyond<br />
					entanglement in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mettagu:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">And I relish, Great Seer,<br />
					that Dhamma &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supreme,<br />
					knowing which, living mindfully,<br />
					I'll cross over beyond<br />
					entanglement in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever you're alert to,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; above, below,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; across, in between:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					dispelling any delight,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any laying claim<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to those things,<br />
					consciousness should not take a stance<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in becoming.<br />
					The monk who dwells thus<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- mindful, heedful -- <br />
					letting go of his sense of <i>mine,</i><br />
					knowing right here would abandon<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; birth and aging,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lamentation and sorrow,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mettagu:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I relish, Gotama, the Great Seer's words<br />
					well-expounded, without acquisition,<br />
					for yes, O Blessed One,<br />
					you've abandoned stress and suffering<br />
					as this Dhamma has<br />
					been known by you.<br />
					And they, too, would abandon stress and suffering<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; those whom you, sage,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would admonish unceasingly.<br />
					Having met you, I bow down to you,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great One.<br />
					Perhaps you will admonish me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unceasingly.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>The Buddha:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whoever you recognize<br />
					as a knowledgeable brahman,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possessing nothing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unentangled<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in sensuality and becoming<br />
					yes, he has crossed over the flood.<br />
					Having crossed to the far shore,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he is without<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harshness or doubt.<br />
					<br />
					And any one who has realized,<br />
					who is knowledgeable here,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having unentangled the bond<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to becoming and non-,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					free of craving,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; untroubled,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; undesiring -- he,<br />
					I tell you, has crossed over birth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and aging.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The term "acquisition" <i>(upadhi),</i> in its everyday sense, denotes the possessions, baggage, and other paraphernalia that a nomadic family might carry around with it in its wanderings. On the psychological level, it denotes anything for which one might have a sense of "I" or "mine" and which, consequently, one would carry around as a kind of mental baggage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Nd.II gives six different valid interpretations for "above, below, across, in between":<br />
					above = the future; below = the past; across and in between = the present<br />
					above = the deva world; below = hell; across and in between = the human world<br />
					above = skillfulness; below = unskillfulness; across and in between = indeterminate mental qualities<br />
					above = the property of formlessness; below = the property of sensuality; across and in between = the property of form<br />
					above = feelings of pleasure; below = feelings of pain; across and in between = feelings of neither pleasure nor pain<br />
					above = the body from the feet on up; below = the body from the crown of the head on down; across and in between = the middle of the body</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Becoming and non-becoming (or dis-becoming) are the two most subtle objects of craving that lead on to continued existence -- and suffering -- in the round of birth and death.</p>
