					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> An ancient Indian belief, dating back to the Vedas, was that the sight of certain things or beings was believed to purify. Thus "in connection with what's seen" here means both that purity is brought about by means of seeing such a sight, and that one's purity is measured in terms of having such a sight. This belief survives today in the practice of <i>darshan.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> In other words, if purity were simply a matter of seeing or knowing something, a person could be pure in this sense and yet still have acquisitions (= defilements), which would not be true purity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> "Brahman" in the Buddhist sense, i.e., a person born in any caste who has become an arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Nd.I: Leaving one teacher and going to another; leaving one teaching and going to another. This phrase may also refer to the mind's tendency to leave one craving to go to another.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> "Like a monkey releasing a branch to seize at another" -- an interesting example of a whole phrase that functions as a "lamp," i.e., modifying both the phrase before it and the phrase after it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Vedas -- Just as the word "brahman" is used in a Buddhist sense above, here the word <i>veda</i> is given a Buddhist sense. According to the Commentary, in this context it means the knowledge accompanying four transcendent paths: the paths to stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, and arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Nd.I: The enemies here are the armies of Mara -- all unskillful qualities. For a detailed inventory of the armies of Mara, see <a href="snp.3-02.than.ati.htm">Sn III.2</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "Open" means having a mind not covered or concealed by craving, defilement, or ignorance. This image is used in <a href="../ud/ud.5-05.than.ati.htm">Ud V.5</a>. It is in contrast to the image discussed in <a href="snp.4-02.than.ati.htm#n2-1">note 1 to Sn IV.2</a>. An alternative meaning here might be having one's eyes open.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> By whom, with what -- two meanings of the one Pali word, <i>kena.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "Territories" = the ten fetters <i>(saŋyojana)</i> and seven obsessions <i>(anusaya).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Nd.I: "Passion" = sensuality; "dispassion" = the jhāna states that bring about dispassion for sensuality.</p>
