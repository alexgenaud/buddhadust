					<p class="f4">To me -- <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolute in exertion<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; near the river Nerañjara,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; making a great effort,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing jhāna<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to attain rest from the yoke --</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="namuci">Namuci</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> came,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speaking words of compassion:<br />
					"You are ashen, thin.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Death is in<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your presence.<br />
					Death <br />
					has 1,000 parts of you.<br />
					Only one part <br />
					is your life.<br />
					Live, good sir! <br />
					Life is better.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alive,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you can do<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; acts of merit.<br />
					Your living the holy life,<br />
					performing the fire sacrifice,<br />
					will heap up much merit.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What use is exertion to you?<br />
					Hard to follow<br />
					-- the path of exertion -- <br />
					hard to do, hard<br />
					to sustain."</p>

					<p class="f4">Saying these verses,<br />
					Mara stood in the Awakened One's presence.<br />
					And to that Mara, speaking thus,<br />
					the Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kinsman of the heedless,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Evil One,<br />
					come here for whatever purpose:<br />
					I haven't, for merit,<br />
					even the least bit of need.<br />
					Those who have need of merit:<br />
					those are the ones<br />
					Mara's fit to address.</p>

					<p class="f4">In me are &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conviction,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; austerity,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistence,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment.<br />
					Why, when I'm so resolute <br />
					do you petition me <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to live?<br />
					This wind could burn up<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even river currents.<br />
					Why, when I'm resolute<br />
					shouldn't my blood dry away?<br />
					As my blood dries up<br />
					gall and phlegm dry up.<br />
					As muscles waste away,<br />
					the mind grows clearer;<br />
					mindfulness, discernment,<br />
					concentration stand <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more firm.<br />
					Staying in this way,<br />
					attaining the ultimate feeling,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the mind has no interest <br />
					in sensual passions.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a being's <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; purity!</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual passions are your first army.<br />
					Your second &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Discontent.<br />
					Your third &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Hunger and Thirst.<br />
					Your fourth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Craving.<br />
					Fifth&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Sloth and Drowsiness.<br />
					Sixth &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is called Terror.<br />
					Your seventh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is Uncertainty.<br />
					Hypocrisy and Stubbornness, your eighth.<br />
					Gains, Offerings, Fame, and Status<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrongly gained,<br />
					and whoever would praise self<br />
					and disparage others.</p>

					<p class="f4">That, Namuci, is your army,<br />
					the Dark One's commando force.<br />
					A coward can't defeat it,<br />
					but one having defeated it<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gains bliss.<br />
					<a id="munja">Do</a> <i>I</i> carry muñja grass?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					I spit on my life.<br />
					Death in battle would be better for me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than that I, defeated,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; survive.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sinking here, they don't appear,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some priests and contemplatives.<br />
					They don't know the path<br />
					by which those with good practices<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing the bannered force<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on all sides -- <br />
					the troops, Mara <br />
					along with his mount -- <br />
					I go into battle.<br />
					May they not budge me<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my spot.<br />
					That army of yours,<br />
					that the world with its devas<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; can't overcome,<br />
					<a id="pot">I will smash</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with discernment -- <br />
					as an unfired pot &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a stone.</p>

					<p class="f4">Making &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my resolve mastered,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindfulness well-established,<br />
					I will go about, from kingdom to kingdom,<br />
					training many disciples.<br />
					They -- heedful, resolute<br />
					doing my bidding -- <br />
					despite your wishes, will go<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where, having gone,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no grief."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>Mara:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"For seven years, I've dogged<br />
					the Blessed One's steps,<br />
					but haven't gained an opening<br />
					in the One Self-awakened<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and glorious.<br />
					A crow circled a stone<br />
					the color of fat<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- 'Maybe I've found<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; something tender here.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe there's something delicious' -- <br />
					but not getting anything delicious there,<br />
					the crow went away.<br />
					Like the crow attacking the rock,<br />
					I weary myself with Gotama."</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was overcome with sorrow,<br />
					his lute fell from under his arm.<br />
					Then he, the despondent spirit,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; right there<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disappeared.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The highest equanimity that can be attained through jhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Muñja grass was the ancient Indian equivalent of a white flag. A warrior expecting that he might have to surrender would take muñja grass into battle with him. If he did surrender, he would lie down with the muñja grass in his mouth. The Buddha, in asking this rhetorical question, is indicating that he is not the type of warrior who would carry muñja grass. If defeated, he would rather die than surrender.</p>
