					<p class="f4">"I ask the kinsman of the Sun, the great seer,<br />
					about seclusion and the state of peace.<br />
					Seeing in what way is a monk unbound,<br />
					clinging to nothing in the world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"He should put an entire stop<br />
					to the root of complication-classifications:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I am the thinker.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					He should train, always mindful,<br />
					to subdue any craving inside him.<br />
					Whatever truth he may know,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within or without,<br />
					he shouldn't get entrenched<br />
					in connection with it,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for that isn't called<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding by the good.<br />
					He shouldn't, because of it, think himself<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; better,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lower, or<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equal.<br />
					Touched by contact in various ways,<br />
					he shouldn't keep conjuring self.<br />
					Stilled right within,<br />
					a monk shouldn't seek peace from another<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from anything else.<br />
					For one stilled right within,<br />
					there's nothing embraced,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so how rejected?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing that's self,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so from whence would there be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; against-self?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="sea">As in</a> the middle of the sea<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it is still,<br />
					with no waves upwelling,<br />
					so the monk -- unperturbed, still -- <br />
					should not swell himself<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; anywhere."</p>

					<p class="f4">"He whose eyes are open has described<br />
					the Dhamma he's witnessed,<br />
					subduing danger.<br />
					Now tell us, sir, the practice:<br />
					the code of discipline and concentration."</p>

					<p class="f4">"One shouldn't be careless with his eyes,<br />
					should close his ears to village-talk,<br />
					shouldn't hunger for flavors,<br />
					or view anything in the world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as <i>mine.</i><br />
					When touched by contact<br />
					he shouldn't lament,<br />
					shouldn't covet anywhere any<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; states of becoming,<br />
					or tremble at terrors.<br />
					When gaining food and drink,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; staples and cloth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he should not make a hoard.<br />
					Nor should he be upset<br />
					when receiving no gains.<br />
					Absorbed, not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; foot-loose,<br />
					he should refrain&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from restlessness,<br />
					shouldn't be&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heedless,<br />
					should live &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a noise-less abode.<br />
					Not making much of sleep,<br />
					ardent, given to wakefulness,<br />
					he should abandon sloth, deception,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laughter, sports,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fornication, and all that goes with it;<br />
					should not practice charms,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interpret physical marks, dreams,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the stars, animal cries;<br />
					should not be devoted to<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; practicing medicine or inducing fertility.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk shouldn't tremble at blame<br />
					or grow haughty with praise;<br />
					should thrust aside selfishness, greed,<br />
					divisive speech, anger;<br />
					shouldn't buy or sell<br />
					or revile anyone anywhere;<br />
					shouldn't linger in villages,<br />
					or flatter people in hopes of gains.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk shouldn't boast<br />
					or speak with ulterior motive,<br />
					shouldn't train in insolence<br />
					or speak quarrelsome words;<br />
					shouldn't engage in deception<br />
					or knowingly cheat;<br />
					shouldn't despise others for their<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precepts,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or practices.<br />
					Provoked with many words<br />
					from contemplatives<br />
					or ordinary people,<br />
					he shouldn't respond harshly,<br />
					for those who retaliate<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aren't calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing this teaching,<br />
					a monk inquiring<br />
					should always<br />
					train in it mindfully.<br />
					Knowing Unbinding as peace,<br />
					he shouldn't be heedless<br />
					of Gotama's message -- <br />
					for he, the Conqueror unconquered,<br />
					witnessed the Dhamma,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not by hearsay,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but directly, himself.<br />
					So, heedful, you<br />
					should always train<br />
					in line with that Blessed One's message,"</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Blessed One said.</p>

The perception, "I am the thinker" lies at the root of these classifications in that it reads into the immediate present a set of distinctions -- I/not-I; being/not-being; thinker/thought; identity/non-identity -- that then can proliferate into mental and physical conflict. The conceit inherent in this perception thus forms a fetter on the mind. To become unbound, one must learn to examine these distinctions -- which we all take for granted -- to see that they are simply assumptions that are not inherent in experience, and that we would be better off to be able to drop them.</p>
