					<p class="f4">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying among the Kosalans on the bank of the River Sundarika. And on that occasion, the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing a fire oblation on the bank of the River Sundarika. Then, having offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, he got up from his seat and looked around to the four directions, (thinking,) "Who should eat the remains of the offering?" He saw the Blessed One sitting not far away at the root of a tree with his head covered. On seeing him, he took the remains of the offering in his left hand and his water-pot in his right, and went to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, at the sound of the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja's footsteps, uncovered his head. The brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja (thinking,) "This venerable one is shaven. This venerable one is a shaveling," wanted to turn back. But then the thought occurred to him, "Still, there are some brahmans who are shaven. What if, having approached him, I were to ask his caste?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, asked: "What is the venerable one's birth-caste?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja in verse:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"I'm not a brahman or king's son,<br />
							not a merchant, or anyone at all.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Comprehending the clan<br />
							of the run-of-the-mill,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;having nothing,<br />
							I wander by means of wisdom<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;in the world.<br />
							Wearing my outer robe,<br />
							I wander without home,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;my hair&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;shaven off,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;my mind&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;entirely unbound,<br />
							not adhering to people here.<br />
							You ask me<br />
							an inappropriate question<br />
							about clan."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Sundarika:</i><br />
							"But, sir, brahmans surely inquire of brahmans,<br />
							‘Are you among the brahmans?'"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Buddha:</i><br />
							"If you say you're a brahman<br />
							and I'm not a brahman,<br />
							I ask you the three lines of the Sāvitti<br />
							and its twenty-four syllables."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Sundarika:</i><br />
							"Because of what<br />
							did seers, men, noble warriors, &amp; brahmans<br />
							—many of them here in the world—<br />
							(first) arrange sacrifices to devas?"</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Buddha:</i><br />
							"Whoever has attained the end,<br />
							an attainer-of-knowledge,<br />
							should receive an oblation<br />
							at the time of a sacrifice,<br />
							his (sacrifice), I say, would succeed."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Sundarika:</i><br />
							"So yes, our sacrifice will succeed<br />
							for we have seen an attainer-of-knowledge like you.<br />
							It's from not seeing those like you<br />
							that someone else eats the sacrificial cake."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Buddha:</i><br />
							"Therefore, brahman,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;as you are seeking your benefit,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;approach and ask.<br />
							Perhaps you may find here<br />
							one at peace, with no anger,<br />
							no desire, no affliction:<br />
							one with good wisdom."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Sundarika:</i><br />
							"I delight in sacrifice,<br />
							I desire to sacrifice,<br />
							but I don't understand<br />
							where a sacrifice succeeds.<br />
							Teach me, sir. Tell me that."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Buddha:</i><br />
							"In that case, brahman, lend ear.<br />
							I will teach you the Dhamma.<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't inquire about birth.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span><br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquire about conduct.<br />

							so a sage, even from lowly birth<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;—steadfast, restrained<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;through a sense of shame—<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">One tamed by truth,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Those with well-restrained minds,<br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>The Buddha:</i><br />
							"What's been chanted over with verses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span><br />

							<p class="f4 in2"><i>Sundarika:</i><br />

							&nbsp;&nbsp;bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja said to the Blessed One, "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the Saṅgha of monks. Let me obtain the Going-forth in Master Gotama's presence, let me obtain Acceptance (into the Bhikkhu Saṅgha)."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Sundarika Bhāradvāja obtained the Going-forth in the Blessed One's presence, he obtained Acceptance. And not long after his Acceptance—dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute—he in no long time reached &amp; remained in the supreme goal of the holy life, for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing &amp; realizing it for himself in the here-&amp;-now. He knew: "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for the sake of this world." And so Ven. Sundarika Bhāradvāja became another one of the arahants.</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The account in SN 7:9 goes immediately from this question to the Buddha's response marked by footnote 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p36">AN 4:36</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> According to SnA, the "clan" of the run-of-the-mill is the five aggregates. However, the clan of run-of-the-mill people might also refer to the customs of all lineages that don't follow the customs of the noble lineage set out in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p28">AN 4:28</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> This is apparently a reference to Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10, an invocation addressed to Sāvitrī, or the Sun:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2"><i>tat savitur vareṇ(i)yaɱ</i><br />
							<i>bhargo devasya dhīmahi</i><br />
							<i>dhiyo yo nah pracodayāt</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Let us meditate on the glory<br />
							of the excellent deva Sāvitrī,<br />
							that he may inspire our thoughts."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">This verse, in the Gāvitrī meter, is recited during the <i>upanayana</i> ceremony, when a young brahman is invested with the sacred thread that initiates him into the status of a "twice-born" brahman and he begins his study of the Vedas. Although similar passages were recited when young men of other castes began their education, Ṛgveda iii, 62, 10 was reserved exclusively for brahmans. It was also the subject of many meditations on its esoteric meaning, some of which can be found in the major Upaniṣads: Bṛhad-āraṇyaka 6.3.6; śvetāśvatara 4.18; and Maitrī 6.7 and 6.34.<br />
					SnA suggests that the Buddha's question about this verse surprises Sundarika, making him suspect that the Buddha knows more about brahmanical lore than he does, which is why he changes his tone with the following question. SnA also asserts that the Buddhist equivalent to the Sāvitti—three lines, 24 syllables—is the expression of homage to the Triple Gem: <i>Buddhaɱ saraṇaɱ gacchāmi, Dhammaɱ saraṇaɱ gacchāmi, Saṅghaɱ saraṇaɱ gacchāmi.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In other words, the original motivation for performing sacrifices was that the recipient of the oblation would be a pure person. The Buddha gives another answer to a very similar question in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp57">Sn 5:3</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> In SN&#160;7:9, the Buddha's initial response to Sundarika begins here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> SnA explains this analogy by saying that it doesn't matter what kind of wood is used to make a fire, for in each case the fire is equally hot and bright. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p93">MN 93</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> In SN 7:9, the initial exchange between the Buddha and Sundarika ends here. Sundarika then offers the sacrificial cake to the Buddha, who refuses it with the passage beginning with the line marked by footnote 18. Then, as in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp4">Sn 1:4</a>, he tells Sundarika to throw away the offering, which sizzles in the water into which it is thrown. Shocked, Sundarika returns to the Buddha, who teaches him five more verses of Dhamma.</p>

					      <p class="f3 in2">Don't, brahman, when lighting kindling,<br />
							imagine that purity comes from that outside,<br />
							for the skilled say that purity doesn't come through that:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;whoever searches outside for purity.<br />
							Having abandoned the lighting of kindling, I,<br />
							brahman, ignite just the inner fire.<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;Constantly afire,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;constantly centered in mind,<br />
							I am a worthy one, living the holy life.<br />
							Conceit, brahman, is the burden on your shoulder,<br />
							anger your smoke, false speech your ashes.<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;The tongue is the ladle;<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;the heart, the fire-altar;<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;the well-tamed self<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;is the fire of a man.<br />
							The Dhamma is a lake<br />
							whose ford is virtue<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;—limpid, praised by the good<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;to the good—<br />
							where attainers-of-knowledge, having bathed<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;cross, dry-limbed,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;to the further shore.<br />
							Truth, Dhamma, restraint, the holy life,<br />
							attainment of Brahmā dependent on the middle:<br />
							Pay homage to those who've become<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;truly straightened:<br />
							That, I call a man<br />
							in the flow of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">After hearing these verses, Sundarika asks for Acceptance into the Saṅgha, and the sutta concludes in the same way as the account given here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">10</a>]</sup> This is a play on words: <i>arahati,</i> "deserves," is related to <i>arahant.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> On the implications of being "everywhere released," see <i>The Paradox of Becoming,</i> chapter 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> According to SnA, the field and site of stress is a reference to defilements. It could also be a reference to the objects of clinging that can form a basis for stress: such things as the aggregates, sense media, and properties <i>(dhātu).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> According to SnA, "seclusion" here means unbinding. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_21_bhikkhusamyutta.htm#p10">SN 21:10</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p63">SN 35:63</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Supports/mental objects = <i>ārammaṇā.</i> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#VIII-1">Ud 8:1</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p64">SN 12:64</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p53">SN 22:53</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> On unbinding as the end of phenomena, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p58">AN 10:58</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp60">Sn 5:6</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> For examples of seeing self by means of self (or self by means of not-self, or not-self by means of self), see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN 2</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> This verse contains a play on words, in that <i>attā</i> can mean both "self" and "mind," and it is used in both senses here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Spirit = <i>yakkha.</i> According to SnA, the word <i>yakkha</i> in this context means "person." See <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/snp/snp.4-11.than.ati.htm#n4">Sn 4:11, note 4</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Boundaries = <i>sīmantā.</i> According to SnA, this is an epithet for defilement, in that the territory <i>(sīmā)</i> stands for good manners, and the end of the territory, or boundary, <i>(sīmanta)</i> stands for the defilements that lie outside of the realm of good manners. For a very different meaning for "territory," see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/kd/snp/snp.4-04.than.ati.htm#n10">Sn 4:4, note 12</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_03_tikanipata.htm#p123">AN 3:123</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp12">Sn 1:12</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> The word, <i>sabba-lokasmiɱ</i>—"in all the world," "with regard to all the world" — apparently functions as a lamp in this verse.</p>
