					<p><b>Translator's note:</b><br />

					This discourse is the source of many proverbs frequently quoted in Theravadin countries. In 1982, when Thailand was celebrating the 200<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the founding of the current dynasty, His Majesty the King structured his chief address to the Thai people around the four qualities mentioned in the Buddha's last verse.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="alavi">Alavi</a> in the haunt of the Alavaka yakkha. Then the Alavaka yakkha went to the Blessed One and on arrival said to him: "Get out, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come in, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time... A third time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come in, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Saying,] "All right, my friend," the Blessed One went in.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a fourth time, the Alavaka yakkha said to the Blessed One, "Get out, contemplative!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I won't go out, my friend. Do what you have to do."</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="ganges">I will ask you a question</a>, contemplative. If you can't answer me, I will possess your mind or rip open your heart or, grabbing you by the feet, hurl you across the Ganges."</p>

					<p class="f4">"My friend, I see no one in the cosmos with its devas, Maras and Brahmas, its contemplatives and priests, its royalty and commonfolk, who could possess my mind or rip open my heart or, grabbing me by the feet, hurl me across the Ganges. But nevertheless, ask me what you wish."</p>

					<p class="f4">What&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person's highest wealth?<br />
					What, when well-practiced, brings bliss?<br />
					What&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the highest of savors?<br />
					Living in what way<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is one's life called the best?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Conviction &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person's highest wealth.<br />
					Dhamma, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when well-practiced, brings bliss.<br />
					Truth is the highest of savors.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Living with discernment,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one's life is called best.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Alavaka:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one cross over the flood?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cross over the sea?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one overcome suffering and stress?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is a person purified?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Through conviction&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one crosses over the flood.<br />
					Through heedfulness,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sea.<br />
					Through persistence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one overcomes<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering and stress.<br />
					Through discernment&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a person is purified.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Alavaka:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one gain discernment?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one find wealth?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one attain honor?<br />
					How &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bind friends to oneself?<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Passing from this world<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next world,<br />
					how&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does one not grieve?</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Convinced of the arahants' Dhamma<br />
					for attaining Unbinding,<br />
					-- heedful, observant --<br />
					one listening well<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gains discernment.<br />
					Doing what's fitting,<br />
					enduring burdens,<br />
					one with initiative<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finds wealth.<br />
					Through truth<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one attains honor.<br />
					Giving<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; binds friends to oneself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Endowed with these four qualities,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- truth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-control,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stamina,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relinquishment --<br />
					a householder of conviction,<br />
					on passing away, doesn't grieve.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, go ask others,<br />
					common priests and contemplatives,<br />
					if anything better than<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; truth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; self-control,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; endurance,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and relinquishment<br />
					here can be found.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Alavaka:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">How could I go ask<br />
					common priests and contemplatives? --<br />
					now that today I understand<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what benefits<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the next life.</p>

					<p class="f4">It was truly for my well-being<br />
					that the Awakened One came<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to stay in Alavi.<br />
					Today I understand<br />
					where what is given<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will wander from village to village,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; town to town,<br />
					paying homage&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the Self-awakened One<br />
					and the true rightness&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Dhamma. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
