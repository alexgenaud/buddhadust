Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining, whatever the Tathāgata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>(tatha)</i> and not otherwise. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata is one who does in line with <i>(tatha) </i>what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this world with its devas, Maras, and Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives and priests, princes and men, the <a id="epi112">Tathāgata</a> is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Thus he is called the Tathāgata." <i>This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing all the world,<br />
					all the world as is really is,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from all the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disjoined,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unmatched:<br />
					Conquering all<br />
					in all ways,<br />
					enlightened,<br />
					released from all bonds,<br />
					he touches the foremost peace —<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding, free<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of effluent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of trouble,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awakened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his doubts cut through;<br />
					has attained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of action,<br />
					is released&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the destruction of acquisitions.<br />
					He is blessed, awakened,<br />
					a lion, unsurpassed.<br />
					In the world with its devas<br />
					he set the Brahma-wheel going.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus divine and human beings<br />
					who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,<br />
					gathering, pay homage<br />
					<a id="mature112">to</a> the great one, thoroughly mature:</p>

					<p class="f4">'<a id="tamed112">Tamed</a>, he's the best<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those who can be tamed;<br />
					calm, the seer<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those who can be calmed;<br />
					released, supreme<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among those who can be released;<br />
					crossed, the foremost<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those who can cross.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they pay homage<br />
					to the great one, thoroughly mature:<br />
					'In this world with its devas,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to compare<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with you.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>This, too, was the meaning of what was said by the Blessed One, so I have heard.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is one of a monk's basic requisites. There is some disagreement as to whether it refers to medicine pickled in urine, or to the use of urine as a medicine (as is still practiced in parts of Asia today).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The five lower fetters are self-identity view, uncertainty, attachment to practices and precepts, sensual passion, and resistance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The Brahma-wheel = the Dhamma-wheel, the name of the Buddha's first sermon, so called because it contains a "wheel" that lists all twelve permutations of two sets of variables: the four noble truths — stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation — and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed. This wheel constitutes the Buddha's most central teaching.</p>
