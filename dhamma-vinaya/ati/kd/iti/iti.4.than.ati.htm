					<p class="f4">"When one is consummate in virtue, consummate in the Pāṭimokkha; dwelling restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in one's behavior and sphere of activity; training oneself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults — what more is to be done?</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, while he is walking, any greed in a monk is done away with, any ill will, any sloth and drowsiness, any restlessness and anxiety, any uncertainty is done away with; if his persistence is aroused and not lax; if his mindfulness is established and unmuddled; if his body is calm and unaroused; if his mind is centered and unified: then a monk walking with such ardency and sense of compunction is called continually and continuously resolute, one with persistence aroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, while he is standing...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, while he is sitting...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, while he is lying down, any greed in a monk is done away with, any ill will, any sloth and drowsiness, any restlessness and anxiety, any uncertainty is done away with; if his persistence is aroused and not lax; if his mindfulness is established and unmuddled; if his body is calm and unaroused; if his mind is centered and unified: then a monk lying down with such ardency and sense of compunction is called continually and continuously resolute, one with persistence aroused."</p>

					<p class="f4">Controlled in walking,<br />
					controlled in standing,<br />
					controlled in sitting,<br />
					controlled in lying down,<br />
					controlled in flexing and extending his limbs<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — above, around, and below,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as far as the worlds extend —<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; observing the arising and passing away<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of phenomena,<br />

From the world, the Tathāgata is disjoined. The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The origination of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been abandoned. The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The cessation of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been realized. The path leading to the cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. The path leading to the cessation of the world has, by the Tathāgata, been developed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever in this world — with its devas, Maras, and Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives and priests, princes and men — is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect, that has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the night the Tathāgata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining, whatever the Tathāgata has said, spoken, explained is just so <i>(tatha)</i> and not otherwise. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgata is one who does in line with <i>(tatha) </i>what he teaches, one who teaches in line with what he does. Thus he is called the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this world with its devas, Maras, and Brahmas, its generations complete with contemplatives and priests, princes and men, the <a id="epi112">Tathāgata</a> is the unconquered conqueror, all-seeing, the wielder of power.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Thus he is called the Tathāgata." <i>This is the meaning of what the Blessed One said. So with regard to this it was said:</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing all the world,<br />
					all the world as is really is,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from all the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; disjoined,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all the world&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unmatched:<br />
					Conquering all<br />
					in all ways,<br />
					enlightened,<br />
					released from all bonds,<br />
					he touches the foremost peace —<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unbinding, free<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; free&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of effluent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of trouble,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; awakened,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his doubts cut through;<br />
					has attained&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the ending of action,<br />
					is released&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the destruction of acquisitions.<br />
					He is blessed, awakened,<br />
					a lion, unsurpassed.<br />
					In the world with its devas<br />
					he set the Brahma-wheel going.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Thus divine and human beings<br />
					who have gone to the Buddha for refuge,<br />

					<a id="mature112">to</a> the great one, thoroughly mature:</p>

					<p class="f4">'<a id="tamed112">Tamed</a>, he's the best<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; among those who can be released;<br />
					crossed, the foremost<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of those who can cross.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus they pay homage<br />
					to the great one, thoroughly mature:<br />
					'In this world with its devas,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there's no one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to compare<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This is one of a monk's basic requisites. There is some disagreement as to whether it refers to medicine pickled in urine, or to the use of urine as a medicine (as is still practiced in parts of Asia today).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The five lower fetters are self-identity view, uncertainty, attachment to practices and precepts, sensual passion, and resistance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <a href="../../sn/04_salv/sn04.35.082.than.ati.htm">SN XXXV.82</a> defines the "world" as the six sense spheres, their objects, consciousness at those spheres, contact at those spheres, and whatever arises in dependence on that contact, experienced as pleasure, pain, or neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> These are epithets usually associated with the Great Brahma. See <a href="iti.1.than.ati.htm#p22">22</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The Brahma-wheel = the Dhamma-wheel, the name of the Buddha's first sermon, so called because it contains a "wheel" that lists all twelve permutations of two sets of variables: the four noble truths — stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation — and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed. This wheel constitutes the Buddha's most central teaching.</p>
