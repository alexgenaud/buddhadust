A non-returner who does not go on to attain Arahantship in this lifetime will be reborn in the Brahma worlds called the Pure Abodes and will attain Nibbāna there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> These two statements are repeated in each discourse. To avoid monotony, they are given here only in the first and last discourses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The bad destinations rebirth in hell, as a hungry shade, as an angry demon, or as a common animal. As with the good destinations — rebirth as a human being, in heaven, or in the Brahma worlds — these states are impermanent and dependent on <i>kamma.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> "The All" = the six senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and ideation) and their respective objects. This covers every aspect of experience that can be described, but does not include <i>nibbana.</i> For a full discussion of this point, see <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html#all"><i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> pp. 30-32.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Appropriate attention <i>(yoniso manasikara)</i> is the ability to focus attention on questions that lead to the end of suffering. <a href="../../mn/mn.002.than.ati.htm">MN 2</a> lists the following questions as not fit for attention: "Was I in the past? Was I not in the past? What was I in the past? How was I in the past?... Shall I be in the future? Shall I not be in the future? What shall I be in the future? How shall I be in the future?... Am I? Am I not? What am I? How am I? Where has this being come from? Where is it bound?" The discourse also lists the following issues as fit for attention: "This is stress. This is the origination of stress. This is the cessation of stress. This is the way leading to the cessation of stress."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> A person "in training" is one who has attained at least the first level of Awakening, but not yet the final level.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> In <a href="../../sn/05_mv/sn05.45.002.than.ati.htm">SN XLV.2</a> the Buddha says, "Admirable friendship... is actually the whole of the holy life... It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth... aging... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair." As <a href="../../an/08_eights/an08.054.than.ati.htm">AN VIII.54</a> points out, admirable friendship means not only associating with good people, but also learning from them and emulating their good qualities.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> The seven treasures are a divine wheel, an ideal jewel, an ideal elephant, an ideal horse, an ideal wife, an ideal treasurer, an ideal counselor.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Magadha was a kingdom in the time of the Buddha, corresponding roughly to the present day state of Bihar. Its capital city, Rājagaha, was surrounded by a ring of five mountains. Vulture's Peak, a secluded rock outcrop in the middle of the ring, was a spot frequented by the Buddha.</p>
