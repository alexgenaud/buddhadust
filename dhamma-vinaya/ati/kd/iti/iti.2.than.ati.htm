					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <a href="../../an/10_tens/an10.176.than.ati.htm">AN X.176</a> defines bodily misconduct as killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct; verbal misconduct as lies, divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter; and mental misconduct as covetousness, ill will, and wrong views (see the note to <a href="#p32">32</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <a href="../../mn/mn.117.than.ati.htm">MN 117</a> gives the following example of an evil view: "There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no priests or contemplatives who, faring rightly andpracticing rightly, proclaim this world and the next after having directly known and realized it for themselves."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> "Not handed down": not derived from an ancient tradition, and not dependent on ancient tradition for its authority.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Direct knowledge = <i>abhiñña.</i> The Canon lists six types of <i>abhiñña:</i> psychic powers, clairaudience, the ability to read the minds of others, recollection of past lives, clairvoyance, and — most important of all — knowledge of the ending of the mental effluents.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Urgency and awe = <i>samvega.</i> Other meanings for this term include shock, dismay, and alienation. In the Pali Canon, this emotion is often accompanied by fear and a sensed need to escape from overwhelming danger. The things that should inspire urgency and awe are the first four of the five reflections listed in <a href="../../an/05_fives/an05.057.than.ati.htm">AN V.57</a>: "I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging. I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness. I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death. I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me." Appropriate exertion is indicated by the fifth reflection: "I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have by actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Ignorance <i>(avijja)</i> means ignorance of stress, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Conscience <i>(hiri)</i> means a healthy sense of shame — derived from self-esteem — at the idea of doing evil. Concern <i>(ottappa) </i>means fear of the consequences of doing evil.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> With fuel remaining <i>(sa-upadisesa)</i> and with no fuel remaining <i>(anupadisesa):</i> The analogy here is to a fire. In the first case, the flames are out, but the embers are still glowing. In the second, the fire is so thoroughly out that the embers have grown cold. The "fuel" here is the five aggregates (see the Glossary). While the arahant is still alive, he/she still experiences the five aggregates, but they do not burn with the fires of passion, aversion, or delusion. When the arahant passes away, there is no longer any experience of aggregates here or anywhere else. For a discussion of this point, see <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/likefire/2-1.html#glowingfire"><i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> pp. 21-37.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Such <i>(tadi):</i> An adjective to describe one who has attained the goal. It indicates that the person's state is undefinable and not subject to change or influence of any sort.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> This discourse illustrates, in a technical fashion, the function of appropriate attention explained in the note to <a href="iti.1.than.ati.htm#p16">16.</a> <a href="../../sn/02_nv/sn02.12.015.than.ati.htm">SN XII.15</a> presents the same point from a different perspective: "This world takes as its object a polarity, that of existence and non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world (= the six senses and their objects) as it has come to be with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it has come to be with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. By and large, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings, and biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He has no uncertainty or doubt that, when there is arising, only stress is arising; and that when there is passing away, only stress is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others."</p>
