And how is it on the strength of Dhamma that I describe [a person as] a brahman with threefold knowledge, and not another as measured by citing and reciting?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk recollects his manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he recollects his manifold past lives in their modes and details.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the first knowledge he has attained. Ignorance has been destroyed; knowledge has arisen; darkness has been destroyed; light has arisen — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, and resolute.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monk sees — by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — beings passing away and re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their actions: 'These beings — who were endowed with bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, and mental misconduct; who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — he sees beings passing away and re-appearing, and discerns how they are inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate in accordance with their actions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The property of form corresponds to the experience of the form of the body as present in the first four levels of jhāna (see Glossary). The property of formlessness corresponds to the formless experiences based on the fourth level of jhāna: the dimension of the infinitude of space, the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, the dimension of nothingness, and the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. The property of cessation is the experience of the total cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, the first of these faculties corresponds to the first noble attainment, the path to stream-entry; the second, to the next six attainments, ranging from the fruition of stream-entry to the path to Arahantship; and the third, to the highest attainment, the fruition of Arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Such <i>(tadi):</i> see the note to <a href="iti.2.than.ati.htm#p44">44.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> At first glance, the verses here do not bear much relationship to the prose introduction. However, if they are viewed in the context of <a href="../../mn/mn.002.than.ati.htm">MN 2</a> (see the note to <a href="iti.1.than.ati.htm#p16">Iti 1 n16</a>), their relationship becomes clear: the person who applies appropriate attention to the notion of past, present, and future time does not define him or herself in those terms, and so does not cling to any sense of self in those terms. Without clinging, one is liberated from birth and death.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> See the note to <a href="iti.2.than.ati.htm#p30">Iti 2.30</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Renunciation here means the first level of jhāna, which is attained when one is secluded from sensual passion and unskillful qualities. On formlessness and cessation, see the note to <a href="#p51">51</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Activity = work of various sorts, such as construction work, robe-making, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, this refers to a monk's tendency to be overly intimate with lay people, overly susceptible to the rises and falls in their fortunes, "happy when they are happy, sad when they are sad, busying himself with their affairs."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The wings to Awakening are the four frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases for power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for Awakening, and the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Devadatta, one of the Buddha's cousins, plotted to take over the Saŋgha, and ended up causing a schism. His story is told in Cv VII. [See also <a href="iti.1.than.ati.htm#p18">18.</a>] His "lower modicum of distinctive attainment" was his mastery of psychic powers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs are those who have attained (1) the path to stream-entry and the fruition of stream-entry; (2) the path to once-returning and the fruition of once-returning; (3) the path to non-returning and the fruition of non-returning; and (4) the path to Arahantship and the fruition of Arahantship. Taking each attainment singly gives eight "individuals."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The "seven attachments" are passion, aversion, delusion, views, conceit, defilement, and misconduct. The "guide" is craving, which leads to becoming.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> As the verse makes clear, these three categories denote three levels of devas in the heavens of sensual pleasure. "Those in control" are at the highest of these levels.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> See the note to <a href="#p82">&#167;82.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> In the brahmanical religion, a "three-knowledge man" was one who had memorized the three Vedas. This verse takes the brahmanical term and gives it a new, Buddhist meaning.</p>
