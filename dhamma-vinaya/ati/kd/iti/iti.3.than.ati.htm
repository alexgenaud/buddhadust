					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The wings to Awakening are the four frames of reference, the four right exertions, the four bases for power, the five faculties, the five strengths, the seven factors for Awakening, and the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Devadatta, one of the Buddha's cousins, plotted to take over the Saṅgha, and ended up causing a schism. His story is told in Cv VII. [See also <a href="iti.1.than.ati.htm#p18">18.</a>] His "lower modicum of distinctive attainment" was his mastery of psychic powers.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs are those who have attained (1) the path to stream-entry and the fruition of stream-entry; (2) the path to once-returning and the fruition of once-returning; (3) the path to non-returning and the fruition of non-returning; and (4) the path to Arahantship and the fruition of Arahantship. Taking each attainment singly gives eight "individuals."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The "seven attachments" are passion, aversion, delusion, views, conceit, defilement, and misconduct. The "guide" is craving, which leads to becoming.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> As the verse makes clear, these three categories denote three levels of devas in the heavens of sensual pleasure. "Those in control" are at the highest of these levels.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> See the note to <a href="#p82">&#167;82.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> In the brahmanical religion, a "three-knowledge man" was one who had memorized the three Vedas. This verse takes the brahmanical term and gives it a new, Buddhist meaning.</p>
