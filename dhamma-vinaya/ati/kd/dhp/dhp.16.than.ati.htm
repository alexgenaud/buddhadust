					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v210">210</a>]</span> Don't ever -- regardless -- <br />
					be conjoined with what's dear<br />
					or undear.<br />
					It's painful<br />
					not to see what's dear<br />
					or to see what's not.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v211">211</a>]</span> So don't make anything dear,<br />
					for it's dreadful to be far<br />
					from what's dear.<br />
					No bonds are found<br />
					for those for whom<br />
					there's neither dear<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v212">212</a>]</span> From what's dear is born grief,<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v217">217</a>]</span> One consummate in virtue and vision,<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v220">220</a>]</span> In just the same way,<br />
					when you've done good<br />
					and gone from this world<br />
