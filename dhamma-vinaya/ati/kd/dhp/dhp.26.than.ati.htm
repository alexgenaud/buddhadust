					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n383" id="n383">383</a>]</span> Having striven, brahman,<br />
					cut the stream.<br />
					Expel sensual passions.<br />
					Knowing the ending of fabrications,<br />
					brahman,<br />
					you know the Unmade.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n384" id="n384">384</a>]</span> When the brahman has gone<br />
					to the beyond of two things,<br />
					then all his fetters<br />
					go to their end -- <br />
					he who knows.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n385" id="n385">385</a>]</span> One whose <i>beyond</i> or<br />
					<i>not-beyond</i> or<br />
					<i>beyond-and-not-beyond<br />
					</i>can't be found;<br />
					unshackled, carefree:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v386">386</a>]</span> Sitting silent, dustless,<br />
					absorbed in jhāna,<br />
					his task done, effluents gone,<br />
					ultimate goal attained:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v387">387</a>]</span> By day shines the sun;<br />
					by night, the moon;<br />
					in armor, the warrior;<br />
					in jhāna, the brahman.<br />
					But all day and all night,<br />
					every day and every night,<br />
					the Awakened One shines<br />
					in splendor.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n388" id="n388">388</a>]</span> He's called a brahman<br />
					for having banished his evil,<br />
					a contemplative<br />
					for living in consonance,<br />
					one gone forth<br />
					for having forsaken<br />
					his own impurities.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n389" id="n389">389</a>]</span> One should not strike a brahman,<br />
					nor should the brahman<br />
					let loose with his anger.<br />
					Shame on a brahman's killer.<br />
					More shame on the brahman<br />
					whose anger's let loose.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n390" id="n390">390</a>]</span> Nothing's better for the brahman<br />
					than when the mind is held back<br />
					from what is endearing and not.<br />
					However his harmful-heartedness<br />
					wears away,<br />
					that's how stress<br />
					simply comes to rest.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v391">391</a>]</span> Whoever does no wrong<br />
					in body,<br />
					speech,<br />
					heart,<br />
					is restrained in these three ways:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n392" id="n392">392</a>]</span> The person from whom<br />
					you would learn the Dhamma<br />
					taught by the Rightly<br />
					Self-Awakened One:<br />
					you should honor him with respect -- <br />
					as a brahman, the flame for a sacrifice.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n393" id="n393">393</a>]</span> Not by matted hair,<br />
					by clan, or by birth,<br />
					is one a brahman.<br />
					Whoever has truth<br />
					and rectitude:<br />
					he is a pure one,<br />
					he, a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v394">394</a>]</span> What's the use of your matted hair,<br />
					you dullard?<br />
					What's the use of your deerskin cloak?<br />
					The tangle's inside you.<br />
					You comb the outside.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v395">395</a>]</span> Wearing cast-off rags<br />
					-- his body lean and lined with veins -- <br />
					absorbed in jhāna,<br />
					alone in the forest:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n396" id="n396">396</a>]</span> I don't call one a brahman<br />
					for being born of a mother<br />
					or sprung from a womb.<br />
					He's called a 'bho-sayer'<br />
					if he has anything at all.<br />
					But someone with nothing,<br />
					who clings to no thing:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v397">397</a>]</span> Having cut every fetter,<br />
					he doesn't get ruffled.<br />
					Beyond attachment,<br />
					unshackled:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n398" id="n398">398</a>]</span> Having cut the strap and thong,<br />
					cord and bridle,<br />
					having thrown off the bar,<br />
					awakened:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v399">399</a>]</span> He endures -- unangered -- <br />
					insult, assault, and imprisonment.<br />
					His army is strength;<br />
					his strength, forbearance:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n400" id="n400">400</a>]</span> Free from anger,<br />
					duties observed,<br />
					principled, with no overbearing pride,<br />
					trained, a 'last-body':<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v401">401</a>]</span> Like water on a lotus leaf,<br />
					a mustard seed on the tip of an awl,<br />
					he doesn't adhere to sensual pleasures:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n402" id="n402">402</a>]</span> He discerns right here,<br />
					for himself,<br />
					on his own,<br />
					his own<br />
					ending of stress.<br />
					Unshackled, his burden laid down:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v403">403</a>]</span> Wise, profound<br />
					in discernment, astute<br />
					as to what is the path<br />
					and what's not;<br />
					his ultimate goal attained:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v404">404</a>]</span> Uncontaminated<br />
					by householders<br />
					and houseless ones alike;<br />
					living with no home,<br />
					with next to no wants:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v405">405</a>]</span> Having put aside violence<br />
					against beings fearful or firm,<br />
					he neither kills nor<br />
					gets others to kill:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v406">406</a>]</span> Unopposing among opposition,<br />
					unbound among the armed,<br />
					unclinging among those who cling:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v407">407</a>]</span> His passion, aversion,<br />
					conceit, and contempt,<br />
					have fallen away -- <br />
					like a mustard seed<br />
					from the tip of an awl:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v408">408</a>]</span> He would say<br />
					what's non-grating,<br />
					instructive,<br />
					true -- <br />
					abusing no one:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v409">409</a>]</span> Here in the world<br />
					he takes nothing not-given<br />
					-- long, short,<br />
					large, small,<br />
					attractive, not:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v410">410</a>]</span> His longing for this<br />
					and for the next world<br />
					can't be found;<br />
					free from longing, unshackled:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n411" id="n411">411</a>]</span> His attachments,<br />
					his homes,<br />
					can't be found.<br />
					Through knowing<br />
					he is unperplexed,<br />
					has attained the plunge<br />
					into Deathlessness:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n412" id="n412">412</a>]</span> He has gone<br />
					beyond attachment here<br />
					for both merit and evil -- <br />
					sorrowless, dustless, and pure:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v413">413</a>]</span> Spotless, pure, like the moon<br />
					-- limpid and calm -- <br />
					his delights, his becomings,<br />
					totally gone:<br />
					he's what I call<br />
					a brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v414">414</a>]</span> He has made his way past<br />
					this hard-going path<br />
					-- samsara, delusion -- <br />

					has gone beyond,<br />
					is free from want,<br />
					from perplexity,<br />
					absorbed in jhāna,<br />
					through no-clinging<br />
					Unbound:<br />
					he's what I call<br />

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v415">415</a>]</span> Whoever, abandoning sensual passions here,<br />
