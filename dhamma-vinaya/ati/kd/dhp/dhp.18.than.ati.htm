					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n235" id="n235">235</a>]</span> You are now<br />
					like a yellowed leaf.<br />
					Already<br />
					Yama's minions stand near.<br />
					You stand at the door to departure<br />
					but have yet to provide<br />
					for the journey.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v236">236</a>]</span> Make an island for yourself!<br />
					Work quickly! Be wise!<br />
					With impurities all blown away,<br />
					unblemished,<br />
					you'll reach the divine realm<br />
					of the noble ones.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v237">237</a>]</span> You are now<br />
					right at the end of your time.<br />
					You are headed<br />
					to Yama's presence,<br />
					with no place to rest along the way,<br />
					but have yet to provide<br />
					for the journey.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v238">238</a>]</span> Make an island for yourself!<br />
					Work quickly! Be wise!<br />
					With impurities all blown away,<br />
					unblemished,<br />
					you won't again undergo birth<br />
					and aging.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v239">239</a>]</span> Just as a silver smith<br />
					step by<br />
					step,<br />
					bit by<br />
					bit,<br />
					moment to<br />
					moment,<br />
					blows away the impurities<br />
					of molten silver -- <br />
					so the wise man, his own.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n240" id="n240">240</a>]</span> Just as rust<br />
					-- iron's impurity -- <br />
					eats the very iron<br />
					from which it is born,<br />
					so the deeds<br />
					of one who lives slovenly<br />
					lead him on<br />
					to a bad destination.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v241">241</a>]</span> No recitation: the ruinous impurity<br />
					of chants.<br />
					No initiative: of a household.<br />
					Indolence: of beauty.<br />
					Heedlessness: of a guard.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v242">242</a>]</span> In a woman, misconduct is an impurity.<br />
					In a donor, stinginess.<br />
					Evil deeds are the real impurities<br />
					in this world and the next.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v243">243</a>]</span> More impure than these impurities<br />
					is the ultimate impurity:<br />
					ignorance.<br />
					Having abandoned this impurity,<br />
					monks, you're impurity-free.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v244">244</a>-<a id="n245">245</a>]</span> Life's easy to live<br />
					for someone unscrupulous,<br />
					cunning as a crow,<br />
					corrupt, back-biting,<br />
					forward, and brash;<br />
					but for someone who's constantly<br />
					scrupulous, cautious,<br />
					observant, sincere,<br />
					pure in his livelihood,<br />
					clean in his pursuits,<br />
					it's hard.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v246">246</a>-<a id="n247">247</a>]</span> Whoever kills, lies, steals,<br />
					goes to someone else's wife,<br />
					and is addicted to intoxicants,<br />
					digs himself up<br />
					by the root<br />
					right here in this world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v248">248</a>]</span> So know, my good man,<br />
					that bad deeds are reckless.<br />
					Don't let greed and unrighteousness<br />
					oppress you with long-term pain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v249">249</a>]</span> People give<br />
					in line with their faith,<br />
					in line with conviction.<br />
					Whoever gets flustered<br />
					at food and drink given to others,<br />
					attains no concentration<br />
					by day or by night.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v250">250</a>]</span> But one in whom this is<br />
					cut through<br />
					up-rooted<br />
					wiped out -- <br />
					attains concentration<br />
					by day or by night.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v251">251</a>]</span> There's no fire like passion,<br />
					no seizure like anger,<br />
					no snare like delusion,<br />
					no river like craving.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v252">252</a>]</span> It's easy to see<br />
					the errors of others,<br />
					but hard to see<br />
					your own.<br />
					You winnow like chaff<br />
					the errors of others,<br />
					but conceal your own -- <br />
					like a cheat, an unlucky throw.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v253">253</a>]</span> If you focus on the errors of others,<br />
					constantly finding fault,<br />
					your effluents flourish.<br />
					You're far from their ending.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n254-255" id="n254">254</a>]</span> There's no trail in space,<br />
					no outside contemplative.<br />
					People are smitten<br />
					with complications,<br />
					but devoid of complication are<br />
					the Tathāgatas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v255">255</a>]</span> There's no trail in space,<br />
					no outside contemplative,<br />
					no eternal fabrications,<br />
					no wavering in the Awakened.</p>
