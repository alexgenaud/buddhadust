					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v60">60</a>]</span> Long for the wakeful is the night.<br />
					Long for the weary, a league.<br />
					For fools<br />
					unaware of True Dhamma,<br />
					samsara<br />
					is long.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v61">61</a>]</span> If, in your course, you don't meet<br />
					your equal, your better,<br />
					then continue your course,<br />
					firmly,<br />
					alone.<br />
					There's no fellowship with fools.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v62">62</a>]</span> 'I have sons, I have wealth' -- <br />
					the fool torments himself.<br />
					When even he himself<br />
					doesn't belong to himself,<br />
					how then sons?<br />
					How wealth?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v63">63</a>]</span> A fool with a sense of his foolishness<br />
					is -- at least to that extent -- wise.<br />
					But a fool who thinks himself wise<br />
					really deserves to be called<br />
					a fool.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v64">64</a>]</span> Even if for a lifetime<br />
					the fool stays with the wise,<br />
					he knows nothing of the Dhamma -- <br />
					as the ladle,<br />
					the taste of the soup.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v65">65</a>]</span> Even if for a moment,<br />
					the perceptive person stays with the wise,<br />
					he immediately knows the Dhamma -- <br />
					as the tongue,<br />
					the taste of the soup.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v66">66</a>]</span> Fools, their wisdom weak,<br />
					are their own enemies<br />
					as they go through life,<br />
					doing evil<br />
					that bears<br />
					bitter fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v67">67</a>]</span> It's not good,<br />
					the doing of the deed<br />
					that, once it's done,<br />
					you regret,<br />
					whose result you reap crying,<br />
					your face in tears.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v68">68</a>]</span> It's good,<br />
					the doing of the deed<br />
					that, once it's done,<br />
					you don't regret,<br />
					whose result you reap gratified,<br />
					happy at heart.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v69">69</a>]</span> As long as evil has yet to ripen,<br />
					the fool mistakes it for honey.<br />
					But when that evil ripens,<br />
					the fool falls into<br />
					pain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v70">70</a>]</span> Month after month<br />
					the fool might eat<br />
					only a tip-of-grass measure of food,<br />
					but he wouldn't be worth<br />
					one sixteenth<br />
					of those who've fathomed<br />
					the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n71" id="n71">71</a>]</span> An evil deed, when done,<br />
					doesn't -- like ready milk -- <br />
					come out right away.<br />
					It follows the fool,<br />
					smoldering<br />
					like a fire<br />
					hidden in ashes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v72">72</a>]</span> Only for his ruin<br />
					does renown come to the fool.<br />
					It ravages his bright fortune<br />
					and rips his head apart.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v73">73</a>]</span> He would want unwarranted status,<br />
					preeminence among monks,<br />
					authority among monasteries,<br />
					homage from lay families.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v74">74</a>]</span> 'Let householders and those gone forth<br />
					both think that this<br />
					was done by me alone.<br />
					May I alone determine<br />
					what's a duty, what's not':<br />
					the resolve of a fool<br />
					as they grow -- <br />
					his desire and pride.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v75">75</a>]</span> The path to material gain<br />
					goes one way,<br />
					the way to Unbinding,<br />
					another.<br />
					Realizing this, the monk,<br />
					a disciple to the Awakened One,<br />
					should not relish offerings,<br />
					should cultivate seclusion<br />
					instead.</p>
