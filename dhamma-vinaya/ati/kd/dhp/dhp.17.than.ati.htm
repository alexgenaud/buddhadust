					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v221">221</a>]</span> Abandon anger,<br />
					be done with conceit,<br />
					get beyond every fetter.<br />
					When for name and form<br />
					you have no attachment<br />
					-- have nothing at all -- <br />
					no sufferings, no stresses, invade.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v222">222</a>]</span> When anger arises,<br />
					whoever keeps firm control<br />
					as if with a racing chariot:<br />
					him<br />
					I call a master charioteer.<br />
					Anyone else,<br />
					a rein-holder -- <br />
					that's all.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v223">223</a>]</span> Conquer anger<br />
					with lack of anger;<br />
					bad, with good;<br />
					stinginess, with generosity;<br />
					a liar, with truth.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v224">224</a>]</span> By telling the truth;<br />
					by not growing angry;<br />
					by giving, when asked,<br />
					no matter how little you have:<br />
					by these three things<br />
					you enter the presence of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v225">225</a>]</span> Gentle sages,<br />
					constantly restrained in body,<br />
					go to the unwavering state<br />
					where, having gone,<br />
					there's no grief.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v226">226</a>]</span> Those who always stay wakeful,<br />
					training by day and by night,<br />
					keen on Unbinding:<br />
					their effluents come to an end.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v227">227</a>]</span> This has come down from old, Atula,<br />
					and not just from today:<br />
					they find fault with one<br />
					who sits silent,<br />
					they find fault with one<br />
					who speaks a great deal,<br />
					they find fault with one<br />
					who measures his words.<br />
					There's no one unfaulted in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v228">228</a>]</span> There never was,<br />
					will be,<br />
					nor at present is found<br />
					anyone entirely faulted<br />
					or entirely praised.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v229">229</a>-<a id="n230">230</a>]</span> If knowledgeable people praise him,<br />
					having observed him<br />
					day after day<br />
					to be blameless in conduct, intelligent,<br />
					endowed with discernment and virtue:<br />
					like an ingot of gold -- <br />
					who's fit to find fault with him?<br />
					Even devas praise him.<br />
					Even by Brahmas he's praised.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n231-233" id="n231">231</a>]</span> Guard against anger<br />
					erupting in body;<br />
					in body, be restrained.<br />
					Having abandoned bodily misconduct,<br />
					live conducting yourself well<br />
					in body.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v232">232</a>]</span> Guard against anger<br />
					erupting in speech;<br />
					in speech, be restrained.<br />
					Having abandoned verbal misconduct,<br />
					live conducting yourself well<br />
					in speech.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v233">233</a>-<a id="n234">234</a>]</span> Guard against anger<br />
					erupting in mind;<br />
					in mind, be restrained.<br />
					Having abandoned mental misconduct,<br />
					live conducting yourself well<br />
					in mind.<br />
					Those restrained in body<br />
					-- the enlightened -- <br />
					restrained in speech and in mind<br />
					-- enlightened -- <br />
					are the ones whose restraint is secure.</p>
