					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v334">334</a>]</span> When a person lives heedlessly,<br />
					his craving grows like a creeping vine.<br />
					He runs now here<br />
					and now there,<br />
					as if looking for fruit:<br />
					a monkey in the forest.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v335">335</a>]</span> If this sticky, uncouth craving<br />
					overcomes you in the world,<br />
					your sorrows grow like wild grass<br />
					after rain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v336">336</a>]</span> If, in the world, you overcome<br />
					this uncouth craving, hard to escape,<br />
					sorrows roll off you,<br />
					like water beads off<br />
					a lotus.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><a id="v337"></a>[<a id="n337" href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n337">337</a>]</span> To all of you gathered here<br />
					I say: Good fortune.<br />
					Dig up craving<br />
					-- as when seeking medicinal roots, wild grass -- <br />
					by the root.<br />
					Don't let Mara cut you down<br />
					-- as a raging river, a reed -- <br />
					over and over again.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v338">338</a>]</span> If its root remains<br />
					undamaged and strong,<br />
					a tree, even if cut,<br />
					will grow back.<br />
					So too if latent craving<br />
					is not rooted out,<br />
					this suffering returns<br />
					again<br />
					and<br />
					again.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n339" id="n339">339</a>]</span> He whose 36 streams,<br />
					flowing to what is appealing, are strong:<br />
					the currents -- resolves based on passion -- <br />
					carry him, of base views, away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v340">340</a>]</span> They flow every which way, the streams,<br />
					but the sprouted creeper stays<br />
					in place.<br />
					Now, seeing that the creeper's arisen,<br />
					cut through its root<br />
					with discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n341" id="n341">341</a>]</span> Loosened and oiled<br />
					are the joys of a person.<br />
					People, bound by enticement,<br />
					looking for ease:<br />
					to birth and aging they go.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n343" id="n342">342</a>]</span> Encircled with craving,<br />
					people hop round and around<br />
					like a rabbit caught in a snare.<br />
					Tied with fetters and bonds<br />
					they go on to suffering,<br />
					again and again, for long.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v343">343</a>]</span> Encircled with craving,<br />
					people hop round and around<br />
					like a rabbit caught in a snare.<br />
					So a monk<br />
					should dispel craving,<br />
					should aspire to dispassion<br />
					for himself.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v344">344</a>]</span> Cleared of the underbrush<br />
					but obsessed with the forest,<br />
					set free from the forest,<br />
					right back to the forest he runs.<br />
					Come, see the person set free<br />
					who runs right back to the same old chains!</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n346" id="n345">345</a>-<a id="n346">346</a>]</span> That's not a strong bond<br />
					-- so say the enlightened -- <br />
					the one made of iron, of wood, or of grass.<br />
					To be smitten, enthralled,<br />
					with jewels and ornaments,<br />
					longing for children and wives:<br />
					that's the strong bond,<br />
					-- so say the enlightened -- <br />
					one that's constraining,<br />
					elastic,<br />
					hard to untie.<br />
					But having cut it, they<br />
					-- the enlightened -- go forth,<br />
					free of longing, abandoning<br />
					sensual ease.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v347">347</a>]</span> Those smitten with passion<br />
					fall back<br />
					into a self-made stream,<br />
					like a spider snared in its web.<br />
					But, having cut it, the enlightened set forth,<br />
					free of longing, abandoning<br />
					all suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n348" id="n348">348</a>]</span> Gone to the beyond of becoming,<br />
					you let go of <i>in front,<br />
					</i> let go of <i>behind,<br />
					</i> let go of <i>between.<br />
					</i>With a heart everywhere let-go,<br />
					you don't come again to birth<br />
					and aging.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n350" id="n349">349</a>-<a id="n350">350</a>]</span> For a person<br />
					forced on by his thinking,<br />
					fierce in his passion,<br />
					focused on beauty,<br />
					craving grows all the more.<br />
					He's the one<br />
					who tightens the bond.<br />
					But one who delights<br />
					in the stilling of thinking,<br />
					always mindful<br />
					cultivating<br />
					a focus on the foul:<br />
					He's the one<br />
					who will make an end,<br />
					the one who will cut Mara's bond.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n352" id="n351">351</a>-<a id="n352">352</a>]</span> Arrived at the finish,<br />
					unfrightened, unblemished, free<br />
					of craving, he has cut away<br />
					the arrows of becoming.<br />
					This physical heap is his last.<br />
					Free from craving,<br />
					ungrasping,<br />
					astute in expression,<br />
					knowing the combination of sounds -- <br />
					which comes first and which after.<br />
					He's called a<br />
					last-body<br />
					greatly discerning<br />
					great man.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n353" id="n353">353</a>]</span> All-conquering,<br />
					all-knowing am I,<br />
					with regard to all things,<br />
					unadhering.<br />
					All-abandoning,<br />
					released in the ending of craving:<br />
					having fully known on my own,<br />
					to whom should I point as my teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n354" id="n354">354</a>]</span> A gift of Dhamma conquers all gifts;<br />
					the taste of Dhamma, all tastes;<br />
					a delight in Dhamma, all delights;<br />
					the ending of craving, all suffering<br />
					and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v355">355</a>]</span> Riches ruin the man<br />
					weak in discernment,<br />
					but not those who seek<br />
					the beyond.<br />
					Through craving for riches<br />
					the man weak in discernment<br />
					ruins himself<br />
					as he would others.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v356">356</a>]</span> Fields are spoiled by weeds;<br />
					people, by passion.<br />
					So what's given to those<br />
					free of passion<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v357">357</a>]</span> Fields are spoiled by weeds;<br />
					people, by aversion.<br />
					So what's given to those<br />
					free of aversion<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v358">358</a>]</span> Fields are spoiled by weeds;<br />
					people, by delusion.<br />
					So what's given to those<br />
					free of delusion<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v359">359</a>]</span> Fields are spoiled by weeds;<br />
					people, by longing.<br />
					So what's given to those<br />
					free of longing<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>
