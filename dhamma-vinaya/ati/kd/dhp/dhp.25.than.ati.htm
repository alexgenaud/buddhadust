					good is restraint with the ear.<br />
					Restraint with the nose is good,<br />
					good is restraint with the tongue.<br />
					Restraint with the body is good,<br />
					good is restraint with speech.<br />
					Restraint with the heart is good,<br />
					good is restraint everywhere.<br />
					A monk everywhere restrained<br />
					is released from all suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v362">362</a>]</span> Hands restrained,<br />
					feet restrained<br />
					speech restrained,<br />
					supremely restrained -- <br />
					delighting in what is inward,<br />
					content, centered, alone:<br />
					he's what they call<br />
					a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n363" id="n363">363</a>]</span> A monk restrained in his speaking,<br />
					giving counsel unruffled,<br />
					declaring the message and meaning:<br />
					sweet is his speech.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v364">364</a>]</span> Dhamma his dwelling,<br />
					Dhamma his delight,<br />
					a monk pondering Dhamma,<br />
					calling Dhamma to mind,<br />
					does not fall away<br />
					from true Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v365">365</a>]</span> Gains:<br />
					don't treat your own with scorn,<br />
					don't go coveting those of others.<br />
					A monk who covets those of others<br />
					attains<br />
					no concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v366">366</a>]</span> Even if he gets next to nothing,<br />
					he doesn't treat his gains with scorn.<br />
					Living purely, untiring:<br />
					he's the one<br />
					that the devas praise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v367">367</a>]</span> For whom, in name and form<br />
					in every way,<br />
					there's no sense of <i>mine,<br />
					</i>and who doesn't grieve<br />
					for what's not:<br />
					he's deservedly called<br />
					a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n368" id="n368">368</a>]</span> Dwelling in kindness, a monk<br />
					with faith in the Awakened One's teaching,<br />
					would attain the good state,<br />
					the peaceful state:<br />
					stilling-of-fabrications ease.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n369" id="n369">369</a>]</span> Monk, bail out this boat.<br />
					It will take you lightly when bailed.<br />
					Having cut through passion, aversion,<br />
					you go from there to Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n370" id="n370">370</a>]</span> Cut through five,<br />
					let go of five,<br />
					and develop five above all.<br />
					A monk gone past five attachments<br />
					is said to have crossed the flood.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v371">371</a>]</span> Practice jhāna, monk,<br />
					and don't be heedless.<br />
					Don't take your mind roaming<br />
					in sensual strands.<br />
					Don't swallow -- heedless -- <br />
					the ball of iron aflame.<br />
					Don't burn and complain: 'This is pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v372">372</a>]</span> There's no jhāna<br />
					for one with no discernment,<br />
					no
					discernment<br />
					for one with no jhāna.<br />
					But one with both jhāna<br />
					and
					discernment:<br />
					<i>he's </i>on the verge<br />
					of Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v373">373</a>]</span> A monk with his mind at peace,<br />
					going into an empty dwelling,<br />
					clearly seeing the Dhamma aright:<br />
					his delight is more<br />
					than human.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v374">374</a>]</span> However it is,<br />
					however it is he touches<br />
					the arising-and-passing of aggregates:<br />
					he gains rapture and joy:<br />
					that, for those who know it,<br />
					is deathless,<br />
					the Deathless.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v375">375</a>-<a id="n376">376</a>]</span> Here the first things<br />
					for a discerning monk<br />
					are guarding the senses,<br />
					contentment,<br />
					restraint in line with the Pāṭimokkha.<br />
					He should associate with admirable friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Living purely, untiring,<br />
					hospitable by habit,<br />
					skilled in his conduct,<br />
					gaining a manifold joy,<br />
					he will put an end<br />
					to suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v377">377</a>]</span> Shed passion<br />
					and aversion, monks -- <br />
					as a jasmine would,<br />
					its withered flowers.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v378">378</a>]</span> Calmed in body,<br />
					calmed in speech,<br />
					well-centered and calm,<br />
					having disgorged the baits of the world,<br />
					a monk is called<br />
					thoroughly<br />
					calmed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v379">379</a>]</span> You yourself should reprove yourself,<br />
					should examine
					yourself.<br />
					As a self-guarded monk<br />
					with guarded self,<br />
					mindful, you dwell at ease.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v380">380</a>]</span> Your own self is<br />
					your own mainstay.<br />
					Your own self is<br />
					your own guide.<br />
					Therefore you should<br />
					watch over yourself -- <br />
					as a trader, a fine steed.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n381" id="n381">381</a>]</span> A monk with a manifold joy,<br />
					with faith in the Awakened One's teaching,<br />
					would attain the good state,<br />
					the peaceful state:<br />
					stilling-of-fabrications ease.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v382">382</a>]</span> A young monk who strives<br />
					in the Awakened One's teaching,<br />
					brightens the world<br />
					like the moon set free from a cloud.</p>
