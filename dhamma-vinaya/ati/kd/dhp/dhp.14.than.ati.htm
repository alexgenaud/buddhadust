					by what path will you lead him astray?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v180">180</a>]</span> In whom there's no craving<br />
					-- the sticky ensnarer -- <br />
					to lead him anywherever at all;<br />
					awakened, his pasture endless,<br />
					pathless:<br />
					by what path will you lead him astray?</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v181">181</a>]</span> They, the enlightened, intent on jhāna,<br />
					delighting in stilling<br />
					and renunciation,<br />
					self-awakened and mindful:<br />
					even the devas<br />
					view them with envy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v182">182</a>]</span> Hard the winning of a human birth.<br />
					Hard the life of mortals.<br />
					Hard the chance to hear the true Dhamma.<br />
					Hard the arising of Awakened Ones.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n183-185" id="n183">183</a>]</span> The non-doing of any evil,<br />
					the performance of what's skillful,<br />
					the cleansing of one's own mind:<br />
					this is the teaching<br />
					of the Awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v184">184</a>]</span> Patient endurance:<br />
					the foremost austerity.<br />
					Unbinding:<br />
					the foremost,<br />
					so say the Awakened.<br />
					He who injures another<br />
					is no contemplative.<br />
					He who mistreats another,<br />
					no monk.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v185">185</a>]</span> Not disparaging, not injuring,<br />
					restraint in line with the Pāṭimokkha,<br />
					moderation in food,<br />
					dwelling in seclusion,<br />
					commitment to the heightened mind:<br />
					this is the teaching<br />
					of the Awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v186">186</a>-<a id="n187">187</a>]</span> Not even if it rained gold coins<br />
					would we have our fill<br />
					of sensual pleasures.<br />
					'Stressful,<br />
					they give little enjoyment' -- <br />
					knowing this, the wise one<br />
					finds no delight<br />
					even in heavenly sensual pleasures.<br />
					He is one who delights<br />
					in the ending of craving,<br />
					a disciple of the Rightly<br />
					Self-Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n191" id="n188">188</a>-<a id="n189">189</a>]</span> They go to many a refuge,<br />
					to mountains and forests,<br />
					to park and tree shrines:<br />
					people threatened with danger.<br />
					That's not the secure refuge,<br />
					not the supreme refuge,<br />
					that's not the refuge,<br />
					having gone to which,<br />
					you gain release<br />
					from all suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v190">190</a>, <a id="n191">191</a>, <a id="n192">192</a>]</span> But when, having gone<br />
					to the Buddha, Dhamma,<br />
					and Saŋgha for refuge,<br />
					you see with right discernment<br />
					the four noble truths -- <br />
					stress,<br />
					the cause of stress,<br />
					the transcending of stress,<br />
					and the noble eightfold path,<br />
					the way to the stilling of stress:<br />
					that's the secure refuge,<br />
					that, the supreme refuge,<br />
					that is the refuge,<br />
					having gone to which,<br />
					you gain release<br />
					from all suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v193">193</a>]</span> It's hard to come by<br />
					a thoroughbred of a man.<br />
					It's simply not true<br />
					that he's born everywhere.<br />
					Wherever he's born, an enlightened one,<br />
					the family prospers,<br />
					is happy.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="v194">194</a>]</span> A blessing: the arising of Awakened Ones.<br />
					A blessing: the teaching of true Dhamma.<br />
					A blessing: the concord of the Saŋgha.<br />
					The austerity of those in concord<br />
					is a blessing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a href="dhp.notes.than.ati.htm#n195-196" id="n195">195</a>-<a id="n196"></a>]</span> If you worship those worthy of worship,<br />
					-- Awakened Ones or their disciples -- <br />
					who've transcended<br />
					complications,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					and grief,<br />
					who are unendangered,<br />
					fearless,<br />
					unbound:<br />
					there's no measure for reckoning<br />
					that your merit's 'this much.'</p>
