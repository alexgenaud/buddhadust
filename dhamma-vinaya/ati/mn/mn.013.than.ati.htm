					<p class="f4">Then, early in the morning,<br />
					several monks put on their robes and,<br />
					carrying their bowls and outer robes,<br />
					went into Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to them,<br />
					"It's still too early<br />
					to go into Sāvatthi for alms.<br />
					What if we were to visit the park<br />
					of the wanderers of other persuasions?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So they headed to the park<br />
					of the wanderers of other persuasions.<br />
					On arrival, they exchanged courteous greetings<br />
					with the wanderers of other persuasions.<br />
					After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies,<br />
					they sat to one side.<br />
					As they were sitting there,<br />
					the wanderers of other persuasions said to them,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, Gotama the contemplative<br />
					describes the comprehension of sensuality.<br />
					We, too, describe the comprehension of sensuality.<br />
					He describes the comprehension of forms.<br />
					We, too, describe the comprehension of forms.<br />
					He describes the comprehension of feelings.<br />
					We, too, describe the comprehension of feelings.<br />
					So what is the difference,<br />
					what the distinction,<br />
					what the distinguishing factor<br />
					between him and us<br />
					in terms of his teaching and ours,<br />
					his message and ours?"</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks, neither delighting nor disapproving<br />
					of the words of the wanderers of other persuasions,<br />
					got up from their seats, [thinking,]<br />
					"We will learn the meaning of these words<br />
					in the Blessed One's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having gone for alms in Sāvatthi,<br />
					after their meal,<br />
					returning from their alms round,<br />
					the monks went to the Blessed One<br />
					and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />
					sat to one side.<br />
					As they were sitting there,<br />
					they [told him what had happened].</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, when the wanderers of other persuasions say this,<br />
					they are to be told,<br />
					'What, friends, with regard to sensuality,<br />
					is the allure,<br />
					what the drawback,<br />
					what the escape?</p>

					<p class="f4">What, with regard to forms,<br />
					is the allure,<br />
					what the drawback,<br />
					what the escape?</p>

					<p class="f4">What, with regard to feelings,<br />
					is the allure,<br />
					what the drawback,<br />
					what the escape?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked this,<br />
					they will not manage an answer<br />
					and, what is more,<br />
					will get themselves into trouble.<br />
					Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because it lies outside their range.<br />
					Monks, in this world<br />
					with its devas, maras, and brahmas,<br />
					in this people with its contemplatives and priests,<br />
					its royalty and commonfolk,<br />
					I do not see anyone<br />
					who can satisfy the mind<br />
					with an answer to these questions,<br />
					aside from a Tathāgata,<br />
					a Tathāgata's disciples,<br />
					or someone who has heard it from them.</p>

					<h4>Sensuality</h4>

					<p class="f4">"Now what, monks,<br />
					is the allure of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">These <a id="strings5">five strings</a> of sensuality.<br />
					Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable via the eye<br />
					— agreeable, pleasing, charming,<br />
					endearing, fostering desire, enticing.<br />
					Sounds cognizable via the ear...<br />
					Aromas cognizable via the nose...<br />
					Flavors cognizable via the tongue...<br />
					Tactile sensations cognizable via the body<br />
					— agreeable, pleasing, charming,<br />
					endearing, fostering desire, enticing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whatever pleasure or joy arises<br />
					in dependence on these five strands of sensuality,<br />
					that is the allure of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="drawback-sensuality">And what</a> is the drawback of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where,<br />
					on account of the occupation<br />
					by which a clansman makes a living<br />
					— whether checking or accounting or calculating<br />
					or plowing or trading or cattle-tending<br />
					or archery or as a king's man,<br />
					or whatever the occupation may be —<br />
					he faces cold,<br />
					he faces heat,<br />
					being harassed by mosquitoes and flies,<br />
					wind and sun and creeping things,<br />
					dying from hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the clansman gains no wealth<br />
					while thus working and striving and making effort,<br />
					he sorrows, grieves, and laments,<br />
					beats his breast,<br />
					becomes distraught:<br />
					'My work is in vain,<br />
					my efforts are fruitless!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the clansman gains wealth<br />
					while thus working and striving and making effort,<br />
					he experiences pain and distress in protecting it:<br />
					'How will neither kings nor thieves<br />
					make off with my property,<br />
					nor fire burn it,<br />
					nor water sweep it away,<br />
					nor hateful heirs make off with it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he thus guards and watches over his property,<br />
					kings or thieves make off with it,<br />
					or fire burns it,<br />
					or water sweeps it away,<br />
					or hateful heirs make off with it.<br />
					And he sorrows, grieves, and laments,<br />
					beats his breast, becomes distraught:<br />
					'What was mine is no more!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />
					sensuality for the cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality,<br />
					that kings quarrel with kings,<br />
					nobles with nobles,<br />
					priests with priests,<br />
					householders with householders,<br />
					mother with child,<br />
					child with mother,<br />
					father with child,<br />
					child with father,<br />
					brother with brother,<br />
					sister with sister,<br />
					brother with sister,<br />
					sister with brother,<br />
					friend with friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes,<br />
					they attack one another with fists<br />
					or with clods<br />
					or with sticks<br />
					or with knives,<br />
					so that they incur death or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />
					sensuality for the cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality,<br />
					that (men), taking swords and shields<br />
					and buckling on bows and quivers,<br />
					charge into battle massed in double array<br />
					while arrows and spears are flying<br />
					and swords are flashing;<br />
					and there they are wounded by arrows and spears,<br />
					and their heads are cut off by swords,<br />
					so that they incur death<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />
					sensuality for the cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality,<br />
					that (men), taking swords and shields<br />
					and buckling on bows and quivers,<br />
					charge slippery bastions<br />
					while arrows and spears are flying<br />
					and swords are flashing;<br />
					and there they are splashed<br />
					with boiling cow dung<br />
					and crushed under heavy weights,<br />
					and their heads are cut off by swords,<br />
					so that they incur death<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />
					sensuality for the cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality,<br />
					that (men) break into windows,<br />
					seize plunder,<br />
					commit burglary,<br />
					ambush highways,<br />
					commit adultery,<br />
					and when they are captured,<br />
					kings have them tortured in many ways.</p>

					<p class="f4">They flog them with whips,<br />
					beat them with canes,<br />
					beat them with clubs.<br />
					They cut off their hands,<br />
					cut off their feet,<br />
					cut off their hands and feet.<br />
					They cut off their ears,<br />
					cut off their noses,<br />
					cut off their ears and noses.<br />
					They subject them to the 'porridge pot,'<br />
					the 'polished-shell shave,'<br />
					the 'Rahu's mouth,'<br />
					the 'flaming garland,'<br />
					the 'blazing hand,'<br />
					the 'grass-duty (ascetic),'<br />
					the 'bark-dress (ascetic),'<br />
					the 'burning antelope,'<br />
					the 'meat hooks,'<br />
					the 'coin-gouging,'<br />
					the 'lye pickling,'<br />
					the 'pivot on a stake,'<br />
					the 'rolled-up bed.'<br />
					They have them splashed with boiling oil,<br />
					devoured by dogs,<br />
					impaled alive on stakes.<br />
					They have their heads cut off with swords,<br />
					so that they incur death<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />
					sensuality for the cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality,<br />
					that (people) engage in bodily misconduct,<br />
					verbal misconduct,<br />
					mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having engaged in bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct, they<br />
					— on the break-up of the body, after death —<br />
					re-appear in the plane of deprivation,<br />
					the bad destination,<br />
					the lower realms,<br />
					in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks,<br />
					is the escape from sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">The subduing of desire-passion for sensuality,<br />
					the abandoning of desire-passion for sensuality:<br />
					That is the escape from sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who do not discern,<br />
					as it has come to be,<br />
					the allure of sensuality as allure,<br />
					the drawback of sensuality as drawback,<br />
					the escape from sensuality as escape,<br />
					would themselves comprehend sensuality<br />
					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend sensuality:<br />
					That is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who discern,<br />
					as it has come to be,<br />
					the allure of sensuality as allure,<br />
					the drawback of sensuality as drawback,<br />
					the escape from sensuality as escape,<br />
					would themselves comprehend sensuality<br />
					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend sensuality:<br />
					That is possible.</p>

					<h4>Form</h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="drawback-form"></a>"Now what, monks, is the allure of forms?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose there were a maiden<br />
					of the noble caste, the brahman caste, or the householder class,<br />
					fifteen or sixteen years old,<br />
					neither too tall nor too short,<br />
					neither too thin nor too plump,<br />
					neither too dark nor too pale.<br />
					Is her beauty and charm at that time<br />
					at its height?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever pleasure and joy<br />
					arise in dependence on that beauty and charm:<br />
					That is the allure of forms."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the drawback of form?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where one might see that very same woman<br />
					at a later time,<br />
					when she's eighty, ninety, one hundred years old:<br />
					aged, roof-rafter crooked, bent-over,<br />
					supported by a cane,<br />
					palsied, miserable, broken-toothed,<br />
					gray-haired, scanty-haired, bald, wrinkled,<br />
					her body all blotchy.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, monks, is the drawback of forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					sick, in pain, and seriously ill,<br />
					lying soiled with her own urine and excrement,<br />
					lifted up by others,<br />
					laid down by others.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This too, monks, is the drawback of forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground<br />
					— one day,<br />
					two days,<br />
					three days dead,<br />
					bloated, livid, and oozing.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This too, monks, is the drawback of forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as a corpse cast away in a charnel ground<br />
					picked at by crows, vultures, and hawks,<br />
					by dogs, hyenas, and various other creatures.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as a skeleton<br />
					smeared with flesh and blood,<br />
					connected with tendons.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as a fleshless skeleton<br />
					smeared with blood,<br />
					connected with tendons.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as a skeleton<br />
					without flesh or blood,<br />
					connected with tendons</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as bones<br />
					detached from their tendons,<br />
					scattered in all directions<br />
					— here a hand bone,<br />
					there a foot bone,<br />
					here a shin bone,<br />
					there a thigh bone,<br />
					here a hip bone,<br />
					there a back bone,<br />
					here a rib,<br />
					there a breast bone,<br />
					here a shoulder bone,<br />
					there a neck bone,<br />
					here a jaw bone,<br />
					there a tooth,<br />
					here a skull.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as bones whitened,<br />
					somewhat like the color of shells</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as bones piled up,<br />
					more than a year old</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>
					<p class="f4">"Again, one might see that very same woman<br />
					as bones decomposed into a powder.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:<br />
					Has her earlier beauty and charm vanished,<br />
					and the drawback appeared?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This too, monks, is the drawback of forms.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is the escape from forms?</p>

					<p class="f4">The subduing of desire-passion for forms,<br />
					the abandoning of desire-passion for forms:<br />
					That is the escape from form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who do not discern,<br />
					as it has come to be,<br />
					the allure of forms as allure,<br />
					the drawback of forms as drawback,<br />
					the escape from forms as escape,<br />
					would themselves comprehend form<br />
					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend form:<br />
					That is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who discern, as it has come to be,<br />

					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend form:<br />
					That is possible.</p>

					<h4>Feeling</h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="drawback-feeling"></a>"Now what, monks,<br />
					is the allure of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk<br />
					— quite withdrawn from sensuality,<br />
					withdrawn from unskillful (mental) qualities<br />
					— enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time he does not intend his own affliction,<br />
					the affliction of others,<br />
					or the affliction of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels a feeling totally unafflicted.<br />
					The unafflicted, I tell you,<br />
					is the highest allure of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again the monk,<br />
					with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation,<br />
					enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of composure,<br />
					unification of awareness<br />
					free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time he does not intend his own affliction,<br />
					the affliction of others,<br />
					or the affliction of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels a feeling totally unafflicted.<br />
					The unafflicted, I tell you,<br />
					is the highest allure of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading of rapture<br />
					he remains in equanimity,<br />
					mindful and alert,<br />
					physically sensitive of pleasure.<br />
					He enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasurable abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time he does not intend his own affliction,<br />
					the affliction of others,<br />
					or the affliction of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels a feeling totally unafflicted.<br />
					The unafflicted, I tell you,<br />
					is the highest allure of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance<br />
					of elation and distress —<br />
					he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time he does not intend his own affliction,<br />
					the affliction of others,<br />
					or the affliction of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels a feeling totally unafflicted.<br />
					The unafflicted, I tell you,<br />
					is the highest allure of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the drawback of feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact that feeling is inconstant,<br />
					stressful,<br />
					subject to change:<br />
					This is the drawback of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the escape from feelings?</p>

					<p class="f4">The subduing of desire-passion for feelings,<br />
					the abandoning of desire-passion for feelings:<br />
					That is the escape from feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who do not discern,<br />
					as it has come to be,<br />
					the allure of feelings as allure,<br />
					the drawback of feelings as drawback,<br />
					the escape from feelings as escape,<br />
					would themselves comprehend feeling<br />
					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend feeling:<br />
					That is impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">But that any priests or contemplatives<br />
					who discern,<br />
					as it has come to be,<br />
					the allure of feelings as allure,<br />
					the drawback of feelings as drawback,<br />
					the escape from feelings as escape,<br />
					would themselves comprehend feeling<br />
					or would rouse another with the truth<br />
					so that, in line with what he has practiced,<br />
					he would comprehend feeling:<br />
					That is possible."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
