					<p class="f4">And on that occasion approximately 500 monks, headed by Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Moggallāna, had arrived in Cātumā to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As these visiting monks were exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes and bowls, they made a loud racket, a great racket.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One said to Ven. Ānanda, "Ānanda, what is that loud racket, that great racket, like fishermen hauling a catch of fish?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, those are approximately 500 monks, headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, who have arrived in Cātumā to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As these visiting monks are exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes and bowls, they are making a loud racket, a great racket."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda, tell those monks in my name, 'The Teacher calls you, friends.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, lord," to the Blessed One, Ven. Ānanda went to the monks and said, "The Teacher calls you, friends."</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, friend," to Ven. Ānanda, the monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to them, "Monks, why were you making that loud racket, that great racket, like fishermen hauling a catch of fish?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, these 500 monks, headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna, have arrived in Cātumā to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were exchanging greetings with the resident monks, setting their lodgings in order, and putting away their robes and bowls, they made a loud racket, a great racket."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Go away, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">I dismiss you.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are not to stay in my vicinity."</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, lord," to the Blessed One, the monks got up from their seats, bowed down to the Blessed One, and left, circling him to the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Setting their lodgings in order and taking their robes and bowls, they left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, on that occasion the Cātumā Sakyans were gathered in the assembly hall on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">They saw the monks coming from afar and, on seeing them, went to them and, on arrival, said to them, "Well now, where are you venerable ones going?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, the community of monks has been dismissed by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, venerable ones, sit down for a moment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps we will be able to reconcile the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, friends," the monks responded to the Cātumā Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Cātumā Sakyans went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One, "May the Blessed One delight in the community of monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One welcome the community of monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One aid the community of monks, just as the community of monks was aided by the Blessed One in the past!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't get to see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when young seedlings don't get water, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration; in the same way, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't get to see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when a young calf doesn't see its mother, there may be a change in it, there may be an alteration; in the same way, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati, having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness, disappeared from the Brahmā world and — just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — appeared in front of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and placing his hands palm-to-palm in front of his heart, Brahmā Sahampati said to the Blessed One, "May the Blessed One delight in the community of monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One welcome the community of monks!</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One aid the community of monks, just as the community of monks was aided by the Blessed One in the past!</p>

					<p class="f4">Lord, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't get to see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when young seedlings don't get water, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration; in the same way, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't get to see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when a young calf doesn't see its mother, there may be a change in it, there may be an alteration; in the same way, there are new monks here, not long gone forth, recently arrived at this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they don't see the Blessed One, there may be a change in them, there may be an alteration."</p>

					<p class="f4">And so the Cātumā Sakyans and Brahmā Sahampati were able to reconcile the Blessed One by means of the simile of the seedlings and the simile of the young calf.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Moggallāna said to the monks, "Get up, friends!</p>

					<p class="f4">Get your robes and bowls.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has been reconciled by the Cātumā Sakyans and Brahmā Sahampati by means of the simile of the seedlings and the simile of the young calf."</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, friend," to Ven. Moggallāna, the monks got up from their seats and, carrying their robes and bowls, went to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to Ven. Sāriputta, "What did you think, Sāriputta, when the community of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I thought, 'Now that the community of monks has been dismissed by the Blessed One, the Blessed One will remain inactive, devoted to a pleasant abiding in the here-and-now.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, will now remain inactive, devoted to a pleasant abiding in the here-and-now."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wait, Sāriputta!</p>

					<p class="f4">Wait!</p>

					<p class="f4">Such a thought should not occur to you again!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed Ven. Moggallāna, "What did you think, Moggallāna, when the community of monks was dismissed by me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I thought, 'Now that the community of monks has been dismissed by the Blessed One, the Blessed One will remain inactive, devoted to a pleasant abiding in the here-and-now.</p>

					<p class="f4">And now Sāriputta and I will look after the community of monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, Moggallāna!</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">For either I should look after the community of monks or Sāriputta and Moggallāna should."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks, there are these four dangers to be expected by those who go down into the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Danger from waves, danger from crocodiles, danger from whirlpools, and danger from sharks.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four dangers to be expected by those who go down into the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In same way, there are these four dangers to be expected by certain individuals who have gone forth from home life into homelessness in this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">Danger from waves, danger from crocodiles, danger from whirlpools, and danger from sharks.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which is the danger from waves?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a son of a good family, out of conviction, has gone forth from the home life into homelessness, (thinking,) 'I am beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!'</p>

					<p class="f4">After he has thus gone forth, his fellows in the holy life admonish and instruct him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is how you should go forward.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should go back.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should look ahead.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should look away.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should flex and extend your limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how you should wear and carry your patchwork robe, your upper robe, and your bowl.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The thought occurs to him, 'Before, when we<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> were a householder, we admonished and instructed others.</p>

					<p class="f4">But now these — who are no more than our sons and grandsons, as it were — suppose that we are to be admonished and instructed!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He disavows the training and returns to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called one who has disavowed the training<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> frightened by the danger from waves — for 'danger from waves' is a synonym for anger and distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which is the danger from crocodiles?</p>

					<p class="f4">O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!'</p>

					<p class="f4">After he has thus gone forth, his fellows in the holy life admonish and instruct him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This you should eat; this you shouldn't eat.</p>

					<p class="f4">This you should consume; this you shouldn't consume.</p>

					<p class="f4">This you should drink; this you shouldn't drink.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat what is allowable; you shouldn't eat what is not allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should consume what is allowable; you shouldn't consume what is not allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should savor what is allowable; you shouldn't savor what is not allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should drink what is allowable; you shouldn't drink what is not allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should eat at the right time; you shouldn't eat at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should consume at the right time; you shouldn't consume at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should savor at the right time; you shouldn't savor at the wrong time.</p>

					<p class="f4">You should drink at the right time; you shouldn't drink eat at the wrong time.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The thought occurs to him, 'Before, when we were a householder, we ate what we wanted and didn't eat what we didn't want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We consumed what we wanted and didn't consume what we didn't want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We savored what we wanted and didn't savor what we didn't want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We drank what we wanted and didn't drink what we didn't want.</p>

					<p class="f4">We ate what was allowable and we ate what wasn't allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">We consumed what was allowable and we consumed what wasn't allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">We savored what was allowable and we savored what wasn't allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">We drank what was allowable and we drank what wasn't allowable.</p>

					<p class="f4">He disavows the training and returns to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called one who has disavowed the training frightened by the danger from crocodiles — for 'danger from crocodiles' is a synonym for gluttony.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which is the danger from whirlpools?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a son of a good family, out of conviction, has gone forth from the home life into homelessness, (thinking,) 'I am beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">O, that the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Early in the morning, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and robes, he goes into a village or town for alms, with his body unguarded, his speech unguarded, his mindfulness unestablished, his faculties unrestrained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees a householder or householder's son going about, endowed and provided with the five strings of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The thought occurs to him, 'Before, when we were a householder, we too went about, endowed and provided with the five strings of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, our family has enough wealth that it would be possible to enjoy wealth and make merit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He disavows the training and returns to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing a woman scantily clothed, scantily dressed, lust agitates his mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his mind agitated by lust, he disavows the training and returns to the lower life.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are the four dangers to be expected by certain individuals who have gone forth from home life into homelessness in this Dhamma and Vinaya."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
