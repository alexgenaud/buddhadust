					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>
					
					<p>This sutta illustrates a principle set forth in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1:</a> that run-of-the-mill people, when praising the Buddha, tend to speak only of minor matters, connected with virtue. They don't really understand the higher reasons for giving the Buddha the praise he rightly deserves.</p>
					
					<p>Sakuludāyin the wanderer, in conversation with the Buddha, here states that the Buddha is respected by his followers because he eats little; he is content with little in terms of food, clothing, and shelter; and he practices seclusion. The Buddha replies that he has students who eat less than he does; who are more ascetic than he is in terms of food, clothing, and shelter; and who practice seclusion more stringently than he does. If Sakuludāyin's reasons were the only ones for which the Buddha's followers respected him, these more stringent followers wouldn't respect him at all.</p>
					
					<p>The Buddha then goes on to explain five deeper reasons for which his followers respect him. The five fall into two sorts: qualities of his character, and his ability to teach them to master many skills, all the way to the total ending of suffering.</p>
					
					<p>Because the Buddha in this sutta states that he does not follow the strict ascetic regimen that some of his students do, some people have interpreted this sutta as an implied criticism of those students and of ascetic regimens in general. This interpretation, however, takes the Buddha's statements out of two contexts: their context within this sutta, and their context within his statements about ascetic regimens in other suttas.</p>
					
					<p>In terms of this sutta, there is nothing in the Buddha's words in this sutta to suggest that he is criticizing his stricter followers in any way. And in terms of his statements about asceticism in other suttas, it's easy to see why. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p101">MN 101</a> contains a passage that is particularly relevant here.</p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"Suppose a fletcher were to heat and warm an arrow shaft between two flames, making it straight and pliable. Then at a later time he would no longer heat and warm the shaft between two flames, making it straight and pliable. Why is that? Because he has attained the goal for which he was heating and warming the shaft. That is why at a later time he would no longer heat and warm the shaft between two flames, making it straight and pliable.</p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"In the same way, the monk notices this: 'When I live according to my pleasure, unskillful qualities increase in me and skillful qualities decline. When I exert myself with stress and pain, though, unskillful qualities decline in me and skillful qualities increase. Why don't I exert myself with stress and pain?' So he exerts himself with stress and pain, and while he is exerting himself with stress and pain, unskillful qualities decline in him, and skillful qualities increase. Then at a later time he would no longer exert himself with stress and pain. Why is that? Because he has attained the goal for which he was exerting himself with stress and pain. That is why, at a later time, he would no longer exert himself with stress and pain."  —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p101">MN 101</a></p>
					
					<p>This passage makes two points. The first is that some people find that they cannot indulge in certain pleasures without provoking unskillful qualities in the mind. In cases like that, they have to avoid those pleasure and practice with pain. This would be the legitimate reason for which the Buddha's followers would follow a stricter ascetic regimen than the Buddha, and there would be no reason for him to criticize them for doing so.</p>
					
					<p>The second point explains why the Buddha himself no longer adheres to an ascetic regimen: He has already achieved his goal, and so is in no danger of falling back, even when eating larger amounts of food; when making use of exquisite food, clothing, and shelter; and when living surrounded by students and visitors. He is like the fletcher who has succeeded in straightening the arrow and no longer has to heat it between two flames.</p>
					
					<p>Rather than taking a categorical position that all asceticism is bad or all asceticism is good, the Buddha took an analytical approach to the issue:</p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"If, when an asceticism is pursued, unskillful qualities increase and skillful qualities decline, then I tell you that that sort of asceticism is not to be pursued. But if, when an asceticism is pursued, unskillful qualities decline and skillful qualities increase, then I tell you that that sort of asceticism is to be pursued."  —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p94">AN 10:94</a></p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"Headman, those who say, 'Gotama the contemplative criticizes all asceticism, that he categorically denounces and disparages all ascetics who live the rough life,' are not saying what I have said, and they slander me with what is unfactual and untrue....</p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"As for the ascetic living the rough life who afflicts and torments himself, who doesn't attain a skilled state, and doesn't realize a superior human state, a truly noble distinction of knowledge and vision: This ascetic living the rough life can be criticized on three grounds. On which three grounds can he be criticized? 'He afflicts and torments himself': This is the first ground on which he can be criticized. 'He doesn't attain a skilled state': This is the second ground on which he can be criticized. 'He doesn't realize a superior human state, a truly noble distinction of knowledge and vision': This is the third ground on which he can be criticized....</p>
					
						<p class="f2 in2">"As for the ascetic living the rough life who afflicts and torments himself, who attains a skilled state, and who realizes a superior human state, a truly noble distinction of knowledge and vision: This ascetic living the rough life can be criticized on one ground and praised on two. On which one ground can he be criticized? 'He afflicts and torments himself': This is the one ground on which he can be criticized.... On which two grounds can he be praised? 'He attains a skilled state': This is the first ground on which he can be praised. 'He realizes a superior human state, a truly noble distinction of knowledge and vision': This is the second ground on which he can be praised."  —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_42_gamanisamyutta.htm#p12">SN 42:12</a></p>
					
					<p>The last example shows that ascetic practices, in and of themselves, are not necessarily contrary to the middle way. It is possible to follow them all the way to the noble attainments. And, as this sutta shows, only when you have followed the path to its culmination and attained the noble attainments can you fully appreciate how skilled a teacher the Buddha was.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on that occasion, many well-known wanderers were staying in the Peacocks' Sanctuary — Annabhāra, Varatara, Sakuludāyin, and many other well-known wanderers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning, the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and — carrying his bowl and robes — went into Rājagaha for alms.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to him, "It's still too early to go into Rājagaha for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to go to the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the wanderers' park, and to approach Sakuludāyin the wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One went to the Peacocks' Sanctuary, the wanderers' park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, on that occasion Sakuludāyin the wanderer was sitting with a large following of wanderers who were shouting, making a shrill racket, a great racket, engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings, robbers, and ministers of state; armies, alarms, and battles; food and drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, and scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women and heroes; the gossip of the street and the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world and of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sakuludāyin the wanderer saw the Blessed One coming from afar, and on seeing him, hushed his following:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Be quiet, good sirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't make a sound!</p>

					<p class="f4">Here comes the contemplative Gotama.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is fond of quietude and speaks in praise of quietude.</p>

					<p class="f4">Maybe, if he perceives our group as quiet, he will consider it worth his while to come our way."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the wanderers fell silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One approached Sakuludāyin the wanderer, who said to him, "Come, lord Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are well-come, lord Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">It has been long, lord Blessed One, since you arranged to come here.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have a seat, lord Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">This seat is laid out."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One sat down on the seat laid out, while Sakuludāyin the wanderer, taking a lower seat, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "For what topic of conversation are you sitting gathered together here, Udāyin?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the topic of your conversation that has been interrupted midway?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Sakuludāyin the wanderer replied, "Never mind, lord, about the topic of conversation for which we are sitting gathered here.</p>

					<p class="f4">It won't be difficult for the Blessed One to hear about that later.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the past few days a discussion has arisen among the many sects of contemplatives and brahmans gathered and sitting together in the debating hall; 'What a gain for the people of Aṅga and Māgadha!</p>

					<p class="f4">What a great gain for the people of Aṅga and Māgadha, that these contemplatives and brahmans — the leaders of communities, the leaders of groups, well-known and prestigious founders of sects, highly regarded by people at large — have come to spend the Rains near Rājagaha!</p>

					<p class="f4">"'There's this Pūraṇa Kassapa who is the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and prestigious founder of a sect, highly regarded by people at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has come to spend the Rains near Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">There's this Makkhali Gosāla...</p>

					<p class="f4">this Ajita Kesakambalin...</p>

					<p class="f4">this Pakudha Kaccāyana...</p>

					<p class="f4">this Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta...</p>

					<p class="f4">this Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta who is the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and prestigious founder of a sect, highly regarded by people at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, too, has come to spend the Rains near Rājagaha.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"'And then there's this Gotama the contemplative who is the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and prestigious founder of a sect, highly regarded by people at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, too, has come to spend the Rains near Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Now, among these venerable contemplatives and brahmans, who is honored, respected, revered, and worshiped by his disciples?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, honoring and respecting him, do his disciples remain in dependence on him?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then some said this, 'This Pūraṇa Kassapa — the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and prestigious founder of a sect, highly regarded by people at large — is not honored, respected, revered, or worshiped by his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">And they don't, honoring and respecting him, remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, when Pūraṇa Kassapa was teaching his doctrine to a following of more than one hundred, one of his disciples called out, "Sirs, don't ask Pūraṇa Kassapa about that matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't know it.</p>

					<p class="f4">We know it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ask us about that matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">We, sirs, will explain it for you."</p>

					<p class="f4">Pūraṇa Kassapa didn't get his way, even though he waved his arms and cried, "Be quiet, sirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't make a sound, sirs.</p>

					<p class="f4">They're not asking you about that.</p>

					<p class="f4">They're asking us about that.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will explain about that."</p>

					<p class="f4">And many of his disciples left him after refuting his doctrine:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You don't understand this doctrine and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>I</i> understand this doctrine and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4">How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?</p>

					<p class="f4">You practice wrongly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I practice rightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">I'm consistent.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're inconsistent.</p>

					<p class="f4">What should be said first, you said last.</p>

					<p class="f4">What should be said last, you said first.</p>

					<p class="f4">What you cogitated so long has been turned inside out.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your position has been overthrown.</p>

					<p class="f4">You're trapped, so go try to release your position or disentangle yourself if you can!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Thus this Pūraṇa Kassapa — the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, a well-known and prestigious founder of a sect, highly regarded by people at large — is not honored, respected, revered, or worshiped by his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">They don't, honoring and respecting him, remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he is scorned with rightful scorn.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similarly with Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta.]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then some said this, 'This Gotama the contemplative is honored, respected, revered, and worshiped by his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his disciples, honoring and respecting him, remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Once, Gotama the contemplative was teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds.</p>

					<p class="f4">There one of his disciples cleared his throat, upon which one of his fellows in the holy life nudged him with his knee:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Be quiet, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't make a sound.</p>

					<p class="f4">Our Teacher, the Blessed One, is teaching the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">On any occasion when Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of coughing or throat-clearing among his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, that great crowd of people is standing by in expectancy:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will hear the Dhamma the Blessed One will teach."</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a man at a crossroads were to press out pure honey, and a great crowd of people would be standing by in expectancy, in the same way, on any occasion when Gotama the contemplative is teaching the Dhamma to an assembly of many hundreds, there is no sound of coughing or throat-clearing among his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, that great crowd of people is standing by in expectancy:</p>

					<p class="f4">"We will hear the Dhamma the Blessed One will teach."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And those of Gotama the contemplative's disciples who, having fallen out with their fellows in the holy life, disavow the training and return to the lower life, even they speak in praise of their Teacher, in praise of the Dhamma, in praise of the Saṅgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">They blame themselves, and not others, (saying,) "We were unfortunate and without merit, in that even though we went forth into such a well-taught Dhamma and Vinaya, we were unable to follow the holy life, complete and perfect, throughout life."</p>

					<p class="f4">Becoming monastery attendants or lay followers, they undertake and observe the five training rules.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, Gotama the contemplative is honored, respected, revered, and worshiped by his disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his disciples, honoring and respecting him, remain in dependence on him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Udāyin, how many qualities do you see in me for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship me and — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I see five qualities in the Blessed One for which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship him and — honoring and respecting him — remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One, lord, eats little and speaks in praise of eating little.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact that the Blessed One eats little and speaks in praise of eating little: This is the first quality I see in the Blessed One for which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship him and — honoring and respecting him — remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, the Blessed One is content with any old robe cloth at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, the Blessed One is content with any old almsfood at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, the Blessed One is content with any old lodging at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old lodging at all...<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, the Blessed One is secluded and speaks in praise of being secluded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact that the Blessed One is secluded and speaks in praise of being secluded: This is the fifth quality I see in the Blessed One for which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship him and — honoring and respecting him — remain in dependence on him.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five qualities I see in the Blessed One for which his disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship him and — honoring and respecting him — remain in dependence on him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Udāyin, if my disciples honored, respected, revered, and worshiped me, and — honoring and respecting me — remained in dependence on me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One eats little and speaks in praise of eating little': There are disciples of mine who eat a cupful or half a cupful of food, a bamboo-fruit or half a bamboo-fruit (amount) of food (a day).</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I sometimes eat as much as this bowlful of food or more.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One eats little and speaks in praise of eating little,' then those disciples of mine who eat a cupful or half a cupful of food, a bamboo-fruit or half a bamboo-fruit (amount) of food (a day) wouldn't honor, respect, revere, or worship me or — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old robe cloth at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all': There are disciples of mine who wear rag-robes and coarse robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">They — gathering cloth scraps from a charnel ground, a rubbish heap, or a shop, and making them into patched-together robes — wear them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I sometimes wear robes given by householders, so fine that the hair of a bottle gourd plant is coarse in comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old robe cloth at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old robe cloth at all,' then those disciples of mine who wear rag-robes and coarse robes wouldn't honor, respect, revere, or worship me or — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old almsfood at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all': There are disciples of mine who are almsgoers, who go on unbroken almsround [not skipping over households], who delight in the practice of taking what is to be thrown away.</p>

					<p class="f4">When going among houses, they will not consent even to sitting down when invited.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I sometimes eat invitational meals of select rice and wheat with many curries and sauces.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old almsfood at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old almsfood at all,' then those disciples of mine who are almsgoers, who go on unbroken almsround, who delight in the practice of taking what is to be thrown away, who — when going among houses, they will not consent even to sitting down when invited — wouldn't honor, respect, revere, or worship me or — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old lodging at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old lodging at all': There are disciples of mine who live at the roots of trees or in the open air.</p>

					<p class="f4">For eight months (of the dry season) they don't rest under a roof.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I sometimes live in dwellings with a gabled roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with close-fitting door and windows shut against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if my disciples honored... me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is content with any old lodging at all and speaks in praise of being content with any old lodging at all,' then those disciples of mine who live at the roots of trees or in the open air, who — for eight months don't rest under a roof — wouldn't honor, respect, revere, or worship me or — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If my disciples honored, respected, revered, and worshiped me, and — honoring and respecting me — remained in dependence on me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is secluded and speaks in praise of being secluded': There are disciples of mine who are wilderness dwellers, who live, having plunged into remote dwelling spots, in wild forest thickets.</p>

					<p class="f4">Only once every half-month do they enter into the midst of the Saṅgha for the Pāṭimokkha recitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet I sometimes live surrounded by monks and nuns, male lay followers and female lay followers, kings and kings ministers, sectarians and sectarians' disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">So if my disciples honored, respected, revered, and worshiped me, and — honoring and respecting me — remained in dependence on me, (thinking,) 'The Blessed One is secluded and speaks in praise of being secluded,' then those disciples of mine who are wilderness dwellers, who live, having plunged into remote dwelling spots, in wild forest thickets, and who only once every half-month enter into the midst of the Saṅgha for the Pāṭimokkha recitation, wouldn't honor, respect, revere, or worship me or — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, Udāyin, five other qualities for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship me and — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where my disciples esteem me for my heightened virtue, (thinking,) 'Gotama the contemplative is virtuous, endowed with the foremost aggregate of virtue.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first quality for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship me and — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where my disciples esteem me for my exceeding knowledge and vision, (thinking,) 'Only when knowing does Gotama the contemplative say, "I know."</p>

					<p class="f4">Only when seeing does he say, "I see."</p>

					<p class="f4">It's through direct knowledge that he teaches the Dhamma, not without direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's with a cause that he teaches the Dhamma, not without a cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's with marvels that he teaches the Dhamma, not without marvels.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second quality...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where my disciples esteem me for my heightened discernment, (thinking,) 'Gotama the contemplative is discerning, endowed with the foremost aggregate of discernment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It's impossible that he wouldn't foresee the future consequences of a doctrine, or that he wouldn't refute an existing opposing doctrine, having well-refuted it in line with the Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, Udāyin?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would my disciples — thus knowing, thus seeing — interrupt me in mid-sentence?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's not the case that I expect instruction from my disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">Invariably, they expect instruction from me."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third quality...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, when my disciples have met with suffering and stress, are beset with suffering and stress and overcome with suffering and stress, they — having approached me — ask about the noble truth of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being asked, explain the noble truth of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">They ask me about the noble truth of the origination of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the cessation of suffering ...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, being asked, explain the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of suffering and I satisfy their minds with my answer.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth quality...</p>

					<p class="f4">He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if a dexterous bathman or bathman's apprentice would pour bath powder into a brass basin and knead it together, sprinkling it again and again with water, so that his ball of bath powder — saturated, moisture-laden, permeated within and without — would nevertheless not drip; in the same way, the monk permeates... this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He permeates and pervades, suffuses and fills this very body with the rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if there were a pool of water in a mountain glen — clear, limpid, and unsullied — where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also shoals of fish swimming about and resting, and it would occur to him, 'This pool of water is clear, limpid, and unsullied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here are these shells, gravel, and pebbles, and also these shoals of fish swimming about and resting.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, I have pointed out to my disciples the path of practice, practicing in line with which they — through the ending of the effluents — enter and remain in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized them for themselves right in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there many of my disciples remain, having attained the perfection and culmination of direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the fifth quality for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship me and — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, Udāyin, are the five qualities for which my disciples honor, respect, revere, and worship me and — honoring and respecting me — remain in dependence on me."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, Sakuludāyin the wanderer delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> According to the protocols given in Cv VIII, a monk leaving a monastery in the wilderness with the purpose of going for alms would wear just his under robe, while carrying his upper and outer robes folded over his shoulder or upper back. On approaching an inhabited area he would stop and make sure that his under robe was neatly arranged: covering the area from above his navel to below his knees, and hanging down evenly in front and behind. Then he would put on his upper and outer robe, arranged so that the upper robe was a lining for the outer robe. If he was wearing sandals, he would take them off and place them in a small cloth bag. Only then would he enter the inhabited area for alms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The doctrines of these teachers can be found in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These three areas of contentment are three of the traditions of the noble ones, explained in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p28">AN 4:28</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p11">DN 11</a> explains instruction using the "marvel of pointing out" in these terms: "There is the case where a monk gives instruction in this way: 'Direct your thought in this way; don't direct it in that. Attend to things in this way; don't attend to them in that. Let go of this, enter and remain in that." This apparently means that the Buddha was able to see what was happening in his listeners' minds, and to tell them directly what to do with skillful and unskillful mental qualities as they arose.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> The seven sets of teachings beginning with the four establishings of mindfulness and ending with the noble eightfold path are collectively known as the <i>bodhi-pakkhiya-dhamma,</i> the wings to awakening. In <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">DN 16</a> and other suttas, the Buddha identified them as the most important teachings to know to maintain the harmony and long life of his Dhamma. See <i>The Wings to Awakening.</i> For more detail on the establishings of mindfulness, see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p40">SN 47:40.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The word "perfection" <i>(pārami)</i> appears in only three suttas in the four main nikāyas: <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p111">MN 111</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p11">AN 5:11,</a> and here. In all three of those contexts, it simply means the full development of a skillful quality, and does not refer specifically to any of the ten qualities that were later included in the standard list of perfections.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> For more detail on the bases of power, see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_51_iddhipadasamyutta.htm#p20">SN 51:20</a> and <i>Bases for Success.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p29">AN 10:29</a> adds that the last of these forms of mastery is the most sublime among them, but that even in beings percipient in this way, there is still aberration and change.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p29">AN 10:29</a> adds that the consciousness-totality is the most sublime among these forms of non-dual perception, but that even in beings percipient in this way, there is still aberration and change. For an example of how the earth-totality might be used as a concentration exercise, see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p121">MN 121.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The list of topics from here to the end of the sutta follows the discussion in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a>, with three exceptions: (a) The simile for clairaudience is different. (b) The simile for the ability to see beings passing away and being reborn is also different. (c) The discussion for the ending of the effluents here, unlike the discussion in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a>, makes no mention of the four noble truths, even though the simile used for this knowledge is the same as in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Reading, <i>Devo ca kālena kālaṁ sammādhāraṁ anuppaveccheyya,</i> with the Thai edition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> <i>Mahaggataṁ.</i> This term is used, together with "immeasurable / unlimited," in the standard description of the awareness generated in the practice of the brahmavihāras (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_42_gamanisamyutta.htm#p8">SN 42:8</a>). According to Ven. Anuruddha in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p127">MN 127,</a> however, an enlarged mind is not immeasurable. Its range of awareness is larger than the body but still measurable, ranging in distance from the shade of a tree to the earth bounded by the ocean.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The effluents (<i>āsava)</i> are three: the effluent of sensuality, the effluent of becoming, and effluent of ignorance. They are so called because they "flow out" of the mind and defile it.</p>
