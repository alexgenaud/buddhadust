<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 14. Mahanama the Sakkyan, lamenting over his state of confusion with regard to pleasures of the senses, is given a detailed exposition of what constitutes the pleasure and the danger of the five senses, the thing that is binding Mahanama to confusion, and the way the Buddha himself escaped such confusion. The Buddha then describes an encounter with some Jains wherein he defeats their claim that the end of pain is to be got through pain by showing them that they are practicing their painful austerities without any support in knowledge or understanding and concludes with a description of the exceptional pleasure which he is able to attain." />

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="mahanama">Mahanama the Sakyan</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />
					sat to one side.<br />
					As he was sitting there<br />
					he said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time now, lord,<br />
					I have understood the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One thus:<br />
					'Greed is a defilement of the mind;<br />
					aversion is a defilement of the mind;<br />
					delusion is a defilement of the mind.'<br />
					Yet even though I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One that<br />
					greed is a defilement of the mind,<br />
					aversion is a defilement of the mind,<br />
					delusion is a defilement of the mind,<br />
					there are still times<br />
					when the mental quality of greed<br />
					invades my mind and remains,<br />
					when the mental quality of aversion<br />
					invades my mind and remains,<br />
					the mental quality of delusion<br />
					invades my mind and remains.<br />
					The thought occurs to me:<br />
					What mental quality is unabandoned within me<br />
					so that there are times<br />
					when the mental quality of greed<br />
					invades my mind and remains,<br />
					when the mental quality of aversion<br />
					invades my mind and remains,<br />
					the mental quality of delusion<br />
					invades my mind and remains?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mahanama, that very mental quality<br />
					(i.e., greed, aversion, or delusion)<br />
					is what is unabandoned within you<br />
					so that there are times<br />
					when the mental quality of greed<br />
					invades your mind and remains,<br />
					the mental quality of aversion<br />
					invades your mind and remains,<br />
					the mental quality of delusion<br />
					invades your mind and remains.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
					For if that mental quality<br />
					were abandoned in you,<br />
					you would not live the household life<br />
					and would not partake of sensuality.<br />
					It's because that mental quality<br />
					is not abandoned in you<br />
					that you live the household life<br />
					and partake of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even though a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					has clearly seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment<br />
					that sensuality is of much stress,<br />
					much despair,<br />
					and greater drawbacks, still<br />
					— if he has not attained a rapture and pleasure<br />
					apart from sensuality,<br />
					apart from unskillful qualities,<br />
					or something more peaceful than that<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> —<br />
					he can be tempted by sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when he has clearly seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment<br />
					that sensuality is of much stress,<br />
					much despair,<br />
					and greater drawbacks,<br />
					and he has attained a rapture and pleasure<br />
					apart from sensuality,<br />
					apart from unskillful qualities,<br />
					or something more peaceful than that,<br />
					he cannot be tempted by sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I myself, before my Awakening,<br />
					when I was still an unawakened bodhisatta,<br />
					saw as it actually was<br />
					with right discernment<br />
					that sensuality is of much stress,<br />
					much despair,<br />
					and greater drawbacks,<br />
					but as long as I had not attained<br />
					a rapture and pleasure apart from sensuality,<br />
					apart from unskillful qualities,<br />
					or something more peaceful than that,<br />
					I did not claim<br />
					that I could not be tempted by sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when I saw<br />
					as it actually was<br />
					with right discernment<br />
					that sensuality is of much stress,<br />
					much despair,<br />
					and greater drawbacks,<br />
					and I had attained a rapture and pleasure<br />
					apart from sensuality,<br />
					apart from unskillful qualities,<br />
					or something more peaceful than that,<br />
					that was when I claimed<br />
					that I could not be tempted by sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="sensuality"></a>"Now what, Mahanama,<br />
					is the allure of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">These five strings of sensuality.<br />
					Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable via the eye<br />
					— agreeable, pleasing, charming,<br />
					endearing, fostering desire, enticing.<br />
					Sounds cognizable via the ear...<br />
					Aromas cognizable via the nose...<br />
					Flavors cognizable via the tongue...<br />
					Tactile sensations cognizable via the body<br />
					— agreeable, pleasing, charming,<br />
					endearing, fostering desire, enticing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now whatever pleasure or joy<br />
					arises in dependence<br />
					on these five strands of sensuality,<br />
					that is the allure of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the drawback of sensuality?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where,<br />
					on account of the occupation<br />
					by which a clansman makes a living<br />
					— whether checking or accounting or calculating<br />
					or plowing or trading or cattle tending<br />
					or archery or as a king's man,<br />
					or whatever the occupation may be —<br />
					he faces cold,<br />
					he faces heat,<br />
					being harassed by mosquitoes and flies,<br />
					wind and sun and creeping things,<br />
					dying from hunger and thirst.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now this drawback<br />
					in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress<br />
					visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the clansman gains no wealth<br />
					while thus working and striving and making effort,<br />
					he sorrows, grieves, and laments,<br />
					beats his breast, becomes distraught:<br />
					'My work is in vain,<br />
					my efforts are fruitless!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this drawback too<br />
					in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />
					sensuality for its source,<br />
					sensuality for its cause,<br />
					the reason being simply sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the clansman gains wealth<br />
					while thus working and striving and making effort,<br />
					he experiences pain and distress<br />
					in protecting it:<br />
					'How will neither kings nor thieves<br />
					make off with my property,<br />
					nor fire burn it,<br />
					nor water sweep it away,<br />
					nor hateful heirs make off with it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he thus guards and watches<br />
					over his property,<br />
					kings or thieves make off with it,<br />
					or fire burns it,<br />
					or water sweeps it away,<br />
					or hateful heirs make off with it.<br />
					And he sorrows, grieves, and laments,<br />
					beats his breast, becomes distraught:<br />
					'What was mine is no more!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now this drawback too<br />
					in the case of sensuality,<br />
					this mass of stress<br />
					visible here and now,<br />
					has sensuality for its reason,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Again, it is with sensuality for the reason,<br />
					sensuality for the source,<br />

					child with father,<br />
					brother with brother,<br />
					sister with sister,<br />
					brother with sister,<br />
					sister with brother,<br />
					friend with friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">And then in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes,<br />
					they attack one another with fists<br />
					or with clods<br />
					or with sticks<br />
					or with knives,<br />
					so that they incur death<br />
					or deadly pain.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pain"></a>"Once, Mahanama,<br />
					when I was staying near <a id="rajagaha">Rājagaha</a> on Vulture Peak Mountain,<br />
					a number of <a id="niganthas">Niganthas</a> were at Black Rock<br />
					on the slopes of <a id="isigili">Isigili</a>,<br />
					practicing continuous standing:<br />
					rejecting seats,<br />
					experiencing fierce, sharp, racking pains<br />
					due to exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">So in the evening,<br />
					rising from seclusion,<br />
					I went to the Niganthas at Black Rock<br />
					on the slopes of Isigili<br />
					and on arrival asked them,<br />
					'Why are you practicing continuous standing:<br />
					rejecting seats,<br />
					experiencing fierce, sharp, racking pains<br />
					due to exertion?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					the Niganthas said to me,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Friend, the Nigantha Nataputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> is all-knowing, all-seeing,<br />
					and claims total knowledge and vision thus:<br />
					"Whether I am walking or standing,<br />
					sleeping or awake,<br />
					knowledge and vision<br />
					are continuously and continually established in me."</p>

					<p class="f4">He has told us,<br />
					"Niganthas, there are evil actions<br />
					that you have done in the past.<br />
					Exhaust them with these painful austerities.<br />
					When in the present<br />
					you are restrained in body,<br />
					restrained in speech,<br />
					and restrained in mind,<br />
					that is the non-doing of evil action for the future.<br />
					Thus, with the destruction of old actions<br />
					through asceticism,<br />
					and with the non-doing of new actions,<br />
					there will be no flow into the future.<br />
					With no flow into the future,<br />
					there is the ending of action.<br />
					With the ending of action,<br />
					the ending of stress.<br />
					With the ending of stress,<br />
					the ending of feeling.<br />
					With the ending of feeling,<br />
					all suffering and stress will be exhausted."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
					We approve of that [teaching],<br />
					prefer it,<br />
					and are gratified by it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, I asked them,<br />
					'But friends, do you know<br />
					that you existed in the past,<br />
					and that you did not not exist?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And do you know<br />

					<p class="f4">"'But, friend Gotama,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>A cousin of the Buddha. The Commentary claims that he was already a once-returner when this discourse took place, but there is nothing in the Canon to indicate that this is so.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>This sentence is mistranslated in both "Middle length sayings (I.B.Horner, tr.; PTS)"MLS and "Middle length discourses of the Buddha (Bh. Bodhi, tr.; wisdom Publications)"MLDB. Its point is that the mental qualities that invade Mahanama's mind are precisely the ones he has not yet abandoned. In practical terms, this means that he does not have to look for another quality lurking behind them, but instead can focus his attention on abandoning these qualities directly as they arise. The remainder of the sutta gives a lesson in how greed, aversion, and delusion can be abandoned by understanding the object on which they most frequently focus: sensuality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup>The rapture and pleasure apart from sensuality, apart from unskillful qualities, is a factor of the first or second jhāna. "Something more peaceful than that" would be any attainments higher than the second jhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup><a href="../dn/dn.02.than.ati.htm">See DN 2</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup>One of the great ironies in the history of Buddhism is the extent to which teachings that the Buddha clearly disapproved of, such as this one, have later been taught as quintessentially Buddhist. In some circles, a teaching similar to this one — that non-reactivity to pain burns away the impurity of past kamma and creates no new kamma for the future — is still taught as Buddhist to this day.</p>
