					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>Some scholars have suggested that, of the many autobiographical accounts of the Buddha's Awakening presented in the Pali Canon, this is the earliest. From that assumption, they have further suggested that because this account does not mention the four noble truths, either in connection with the Awakening or with the Buddha's instructions to his first disciples, the four noble truths must have been a later doctrine.</p>

					<p>There is little reason, however, to accept these suggestions. To begin with, the sutta does not recount the Buddha's period of austerities prior to his Awakening, nor does it tell of how the group of five monks attended to him during that period and later left him when he abandoned his austerities, and yet toward the end of the sutta the Buddha alludes to those two incidents in a way indicating that he assumes them to be familiar to his listeners. Thus, if anything, the accounts that do explicitly relate those events — such as the one in <a href="mn.036.than.ati.htm">MN 36</a> — would seem to be earlier.</p>

					<p>Secondly, the lack of reference to the four noble truths does not indicate that they were not actually involved in the Awakening or the first sermon. As is always the case in the Buddha's autobiographical accounts in the Canon, this account is designed to convey a lesson, and the lesson is clearly articulated toward the beginning of the sutta: the difference between noble search and ignoble search. The account then illustrates the Buddha's own noble search and his later teaching career in the terms introduced by the lesson: the search for the "unborn, aging-less, illness-less, deathless, sorrow-less, undefiled, unexcelled rest from the yoke: Unbinding." In particular, all the events mentioned in the account revolve around the issue of the Deathless: the discovery of the Deathless, the teaching of the Deathless, and the Buddha's success in helping others to attain the Deathless. Had the lesson of the sutta sense of compunctioned the four noble truths, they would probably have been mentioned in the account. Thus there seems little reason to regard this sutta as "proof" that the four noble truths were a later teaching.</p>

					<p>Nevertheless, this sutta offers many excellent lessons in the Dhamma, in addition to mentioning a few incidents in the Buddha's life that are found nowhere else in the Sutta Pitaka.</p>

					in Jeta's Grove, <a id="anatha">Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning,<br />
					having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe,<br />
					he went into Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks went to Venerable</p>

					<p class="f4">Ānanda and said,<br />
					"It has been a long time,<br />
					friend Ānanda,<br />
					since we have heard a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence.<br />
					It would be good if we could get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case,<br />
					venerable ones,<br />
					go to the hermitage of <a id="rammaka">Rammaka the brahman</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps you will get to hear a Dhamma talk in the Blessed One's presence."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, friend," the monks replied to Venerable Ānanda and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One,<br />
					having gone for alms,<br />
					after his meal,<br />
					on returning from his alms round,<br />
					said to Venerable Ānanda,<br />
					"Ānanda, let's go to the Eastern Park,<br />
					the palace of <a id="migaramom">Migara's mother</a>,<br />
					for the day's abiding."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One,<br />
					together with Venerable Ānanda,<br />
					went to the Eastern Park,<br />
					the palace of Migara's mother,<br />
					for the day's abiding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the evening,<br />
					emerging from seclusion,<br />
					he said to Venerable Ānanda,<br />
					"Ānanda, let's go to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe our limbs."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Venerable Ānanda replied to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One,<br />
					together with Venerable Ānanda,<br />
					went to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having bathed his limbs at the Eastern Gatehouse,<br />
					coming out of the water,<br />
					he stood in his lower robe,<br />
					drying his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Venerable Ānanda said to him,<br />
					"Lord, the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman is not far away.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasing is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delightful is the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman out of sympathy." The Blessed One acquiesced through silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One went to the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a large number of monks had gathered in the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman for a Dhamma discussion.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One stood outside the door waiting for the discussion to end.</p>

					<p class="f4">On knowing that the discussion had ended,<br />
					clearing his throat,<br />
					he tapped at the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks opened the door for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Entering the hermitage of Rammaka the brahman,<br />
					the Blessed One sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there,<br />
					he addressed the monks:<br />
					"For what discussion are you gathered together here?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the midst of what discussion have you been interrupted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, our interrupted Dhamma discussion was about the Blessed One himself,<br />
					and then the Blessed One arrived."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's fitting that you,<br />
					as sons of good families who have gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life,<br />
					should gather for Dhamma discussion.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you have gathered you have two duties: either Dhamma discussion or noble silence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is ignoble search.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the noble search?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a person,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the noble search.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, too, monks, before my Awakening,<br />
					when I was an unawakened bodhisatta,<br />
					being subject myself to birth,<br />
					sought what was likewise subject to birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being subject myself to aging...</p>

					<p class="f4">illness...</p>

					<p class="f4">defilement, were to seek the aging-less,<br />

					deathless,<br />
					sorrow-less,<br />
					unexcelled rest from the yoke: Unbinding?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, at a later time,<br />
					while still young,<br />
					a black-haired young man endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life<br />
					— and while my parents,<br />
					unwilling,<br />
					were crying with tears streaming down their faces —<br />
					I shaved off my hair and beard,<br />
					put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having thus gone forth in search of what might be skillful,<br />
					seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace,<br />
					I went to <a id="alara">Alara Kalama</a> and,<br />
					on arrival,<br />
					said to him:<br />
					'Friend Kalama, I want to practice in this doctrine and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said,<br />
					he replied to me,<br />
					'You may stay here, my friend.</p>

					<p class="f4">This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter and dwell in his own teacher's knowledge,<br />
					having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It was not long before I quickly learned the doctrine.</p>

					<p class="f4">As far as mere lip-reciting and repetition,<br />
					I could speak the words of knowledge,<br />
					the words of the elders,<br />
					and I could affirm that I knew and saw<br />
					 — I, along with others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I thought:<br />
					'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara Kalama declares,<br />
					"I have entered and dwell in this Dhamma,<br />
					having realized it for myself through direct knowledge." Certainly he dwells knowing and seeing this Dhamma.' So I went to him and said,<br />
					'To what extent do you declare that you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma?' When this was said,<br />
					he declared the dimension of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I thought: 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction,<br />
					persistence,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					concentration,<br />
					and discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, have conviction,<br />
					persistence,<br />

					<p class="f4">What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered and dwells in,<br />

					having realized it for myself through direct knowledge.</p>

					<p class="f4">I went to him and said,<br />
					'Friend Kalama,<br />
					is this the extent to which you have entered and dwell in this Dhamma,<br />

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, my friend...'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'This, friend, is the extent to which I, too,<br />

					<p class="f4">"'It is a gain for us, my friend,<br />

					<p class="f4">"In this way did Alara Kalama,<br />

					<p class="f4">So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In search of what might be skillful,<br />

					<p class="f4 in2">'Enough now with teaching<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only with difficulty<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached.<br />
					This Dhamma is not easily realized<br />
					by those overcome<br />
					with aversion and passion.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">What is abstruse, subtle,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to see,<br />
					going against the flow — <br />
					those delighting in passion,<br />
					cloaked in the mass of darkness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As I reflected thus,<br />
					my mind inclined to dwelling at ease,<br />
					not to teaching the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then <a id="sahampati">Brahma Sahampati</a>, having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in my awareness, thought:<br />
					'The world is lost!<br />
					The world is destroyed!<br />
					The mind of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the Arahant,<br />
					the Rightly Self-awakened One inclines to dwelling at ease,<br />
					not to teaching the Dhamma!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm,<br />
					Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahma-world and reappeared in front me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					he knelt down with his right knee on the ground,<br />
					saluted me with his hands before his heart,<br />
					and said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the One-Well-Gone teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be those who will understand the Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is what Brahma Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that,<br />
					he further said this:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In the past <br />
					there appeared among the Magadhans<br />
					an impure Dhamma<br />
					devised by the stained.<br />
					Throw open the door to the Deathless!<br />
					Let them hear the Dhamma<br />
					realized by the Stainless One!</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Just as one standing on a rocky crag<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might see people <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all around below,<br />
					So, O wise one, with all-around vision,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ascend the palace <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fashioned of Dhamma.<br />
					Free from sorrow, behold the people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submerged in sorrow, <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oppressed by birth and aging.<br />
					Rise up, hero, <a id="victor">victor in battle</a>!<br />
					O Teacher, wander without debt in the world.<br />
					Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:<br />
					There will be those who will understand.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, having understood Brahma's invitation,<br />
					out of compassion for beings,<br />
					I surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I did so,<br />
					I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much,<br />
					those with keen faculties and those with dull,<br />
					those with good attributes and those with bad,<br />
					those easy to teach and those hard,<br />
					some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pond">Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses</a>,<br />
					some lotuses — born and growing in the water — might flourish while immersed in the water,<br />
					without rising up from the water; some might stand at an even level with the water; while some might rise up from the water and stand without being smeared by the water — so too,<br />
					surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					I saw beings with little dust in their eyes and those with much,<br />
					those with keen faculties and those with dull,<br />
					those with good attributes and those with bad,<br />
					those easy to teach and those hard,<br />
					some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having seen this,<br />
					I answered Brahma Sahampati in verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Open are the doors to the Deathless<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; to those with ears.<br />
					Let them show their conviction.<br />
					Perceiving trouble, O Brahma, <br />
					I did not tell people <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the refined,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sublime Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Brahma Sahampati, thinking,<br />
					'The Blessed One has given his consent to teach of Dhamma,' bowed down to me and,<br />
					circling me on the right,<br />
					disappeared right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first?<br />
					Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'This Alara Kalama is wise,<br />
					competent,<br />
					intelligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has long had little dust in his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first? He will quickly understand this Dhamma.' Then devas came to me and said,<br />
					'Lord, Alara Kalama died seven days ago.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And knowledge and vision arose within me:<br />
					'Alara Kalama died seven days ago.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to me,<br />
					'A great loss has Alara Kalama suffered.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he had heard this Dhamma,<br />
					he would have quickly understood it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'This Uddaka Ramaputta is wise,<br />
					competent,<br />
					intelligent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has long had little dust in his eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach him the Dhamma first?<br />
					He will quickly understand this Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then devas came to me and said,<br />
					'Lord, Uddaka Ramaputta died last night.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And knowledge and vision arose within me:<br />
					'Uddaka Ramaputta died last night.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to me,<br />
					'A great loss has Uddaka Ramaputta suffered.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he had heard this Dhamma,<br />
					he would have quickly understood it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'To whom should I teach the Dhamma first?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who will quickly understand this Dhamma?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'They were very helpful to me,<br />
					the group of five monks who attended to me when I was resolute in exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach them the Dhamma first?' Then the thought occurred to me,<br />
					'Where are the group of five monks staying now?' And with the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human,<br />
					I saw that they were staying near <a id="varanasi">Varanasi</a> in the Deer Park at <a id="isipatana">Isipatana</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, having stayed at Uruvela as long as I liked,<br />
					I set out to wander by stages to Varanasi.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="upaka">Upaka the Ajivaka</a>saw me on the road between <a id="gaya">Gaya</a> and the (place of) Awakening,<br />
					and on seeing me said to me,<br />
					'Clear, my friend, are your faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pure your complexion, and bright.</p>

					<p class="f4">On whose account have you gone forth?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who is your teacher?</p>

					<p class="f4">In whose Dhamma do you delight?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said,<br />
					I replied to Upaka the Ajivaka in verses:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'All-vanquishing,<br />
					all-knowing am I,<br />
					with regard to all things,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unadhering.<br />
					All-abandoning,<br />
					released in the ending of craving:<br />
					having fully known on my own,<br />
					to whom should I point as my teacher?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">I have no teacher,<br />
					and one like me can't be found.<br />
					In the world with its devas,<br />
					I have no counterpart.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">For I am an arahant in the world;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, the unexcelled teacher.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I, alone, am rightly self-awakened.<br />
					Cooled am I, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">To set rolling the wheel of Dhamma<br />
					I go to the city of Kasi.<br />
					In a world become blind,<br />
					I beat the drum of the Deathless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'From your claims, my friend,<br />
					you must be an infinite conqueror.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"'Conquerors are those like me<br />
					who have reached effluents' end.</p>

					<p class="f4">I've conquered evil qualities,<br />
					and so, Upaka, I'm a conqueror.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Upaka said,<br />
					'May it be so, my friend,' and<br />
					— shaking his head,<br />
					taking a side-road — he left.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, wandering by stages,<br />
					I arrived at Varanasi,<br />
					at the Deer Park in Isipatana,<br />
					to where the group of five monks were staying.</p>

					<p class="f4">From afar they saw me coming and,<br />
					on seeing me,<br />
					made a pact with one another,<br />
					(saying,)<br />
					'Friends, here comes Gotama the contemplative: living luxuriously,<br />
					straying from his exertion,<br />
					backsliding into abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't deserve to be bowed down to,<br />
					to be greeted by standing up,<br />
					or to have his robe and bowl received.</p>

					<p class="f4">Still, a seat should be set out;<br />
					if he wants to,<br />
					he can sit down.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But as I approached,<br />
					they were unable to keep to their pact.</p>

					<p class="f4">One, standing up to greet me,<br />
					received my robe and bowl.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another spread out a seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Another set out water for washing my feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">However, they addressed me by name and as 'friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So I said to them,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Don't address the Tathāgata&nbsp; by name and as "friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, friends,<br />
					is a worthy one,<br />
					rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lend ear, friends:<br />
					the Deathless has been attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will instruct you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Practicing as instructed,<br />
					you will in no long time reach and remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					knowing and realizing it for yourselves in the here and now.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said,<br />
					the group of five monks replied to me,<br />
					'By that practice,<br />
					that conduct,<br />
					that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states,<br />
					any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble one.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how can you now — living luxuriously,<br />
					straying from your exertion,<br />
					backsliding into abundance — have attained any superior human states,<br />
					any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble one?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said,<br />
					I replied to them,<br />
					'The Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					is not living luxuriously,<br />
					has not strayed from his exertion,<br />
					has not backslid into abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, friends,<br />
					is a worthy one,<br />
					rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lend ear, friends: the Deathless has been attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will instruct you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Practicing as instructed,<br />
					you will in no long time reach and remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					knowing and realizing it for yourselves in the here and now.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time...</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time,<br />
					the group of five monks said to me,<br />
					'By that practice,<br />
					that conduct,<br />
					that performance of austerities you did not attain any superior human states,<br />
					any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble one.</p>

					<p class="f4">So how can you now — living luxuriously,<br />
					straying from your exertion,<br />
					backsliding into abundance — have attained any superior human states,<br />
					any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of a noble one?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said,<br />
					I replied to the group of five monks,<br />
					'Do you recall my ever having spoken in this way before?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'The Tathāgata, monks,<br />
					is not living luxuriously,<br />
					has not strayed from his exertion,<br />
					has not backslid into abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Tathāgata, friends,<br />
					is a worthy one,<br />
					rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Lend ear, friends:<br />
					the Deathless has been attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will instruct you.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Practicing as instructed,<br />
					you will in no long time reach and remain in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					knowing and realizing it for yourselves in the here and now.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And so I was able to convince them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would teach two monks while three went for alms,<br />
					and we six lived off what the three brought back from their alms round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I would teach three monks while two went for alms,<br />
					and we six lived off what the two brought back from their alms round.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the group of five monks — thus exhorted,<br />
					thus instructed by me — being subject themselves to birth,<br />
					seeing the drawbacks of birth,<br />
					seeking the unborn,<br />
					unexcelled rest from the yoke,<br />
					Unbinding,<br />
					reached the unborn,<br />
					unexcelled rest from the yoke: Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being subject themselves to aging...</p>

					<p class="f4">illness...</p>

					<p class="f4">death...</p>

					<p class="f4">sorrow...</p>

					<p class="f4">defilement, seeing the drawbacks of aging...</p>

					<p class="f4">illness...</p>

					<p class="f4">death...</p>

					<p class="f4">sorrow...</p>

					<p class="f4">defilement, seeking the aging-less,<br />
					illness-less,<br />
					deathless,<br />
					sorrow-less,<br />
					unexcelled rest from the yoke,<br />
					Unbinding,<br />
					they reached the aging-less,<br />
					illness-less,<br />
					deathless,<br />
					sorrow-less,<br />
					unexcelled rest from the yoke: Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge and vision arose in them: 'Unprovoked is our release.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the last birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is now no further becoming.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these <a id="p5strings">five strings of sensuality</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable,<br />

					charming,<br />
					endearing,<br />
					fostering desire,<br />
					enticing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognizable via the ear -- agreeable,<br />

					<p class="f4">Tastes cognizable via the tongue — agreeable,<br />
					pleasing,<br />

					<p class="f4">Tactile sensations cognizable via the body — agreeable,<br />
					pleasing,<br />
					charming,<br />
					endearing,<br />
					fostering desire,<br />
					enticing.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five strings of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And any priests or contemplatives tied to these five strings of sensuality — infatuated with them,<br />

					having met with ruin; <a id="mara">Mara</a> can do with them as he will.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="deer">Just as if a wild deer</a> were to lie bound on a heap of snares: it should be known as having met with misfortune,<br />

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />

					<p class="f4">"But any priests or contemplatives not tied to these five strings of sensuality — uninfatuated with them,<br />

					<p class="f4">Because it has gone beyond the hunter's range.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk — quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures,<br />

					<p class="f4">Trackless, he has destroyed Mara's vision and has become invisible to the Evil One.</p>

On Mara's blindness, see <a href="../kd/snp/snp.5-15.than.ati.htm">Sn V.15</a> and SN XXII.87 (the latter in <i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound). </i>For the meaning of "trackless," see Dhp <a href="../kd/dhp/dhp.07.than.ati.htm#p92">92-93</a>, <a href="../kd/dhp/dhp.14.than.ati.htm#p179">179-180</a>.</p>
