					<p class="f4">And on that occasion five hundred brahmans from various provinces were staying at Sāvatthi on some business or other.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to them,<br />
					"This Gotama the contemplative prescribes purity for the four castes.<br />
					Now who is capable of disputing with him on this statement?</p>

					<p class="f4">And on that occasion the brahman student <a id="assalayana">Assalayana</a> was staying at Sāvatthi.<br />
					Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old,<br />
					he was a master of the Three Vedas<br />
					with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology,<br />
					etymology, and histories as a fifth;<br />
					skilled in philology and grammar,<br />
					he was fully versed in cosmology<br />
					and in the marks of a Great Man.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurred to the brahmans,<br />
					"This brahman student Assalayana is staying in Sāvatthi...<br />
					He is capable of disputing with Gotama the contemplative on this statement."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the brahmans went to the brahman student Assalayana and said to him,<br />
					"Master Assalayana,<br />
					this Gotama the contemplative<br />
					prescribes purity for the four castes.<br />
					Come and dispute with him on this statement."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans,<br />
					"Sirs, Gotama the contemplative<br />
					is one who speaks Dhamma.<br />
					And those who speak Dhamma<br />
					are hard to dispute with.<br />
					I can't dispute with him on this statement."</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time...</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time,<br />
					the brahmans said to the brahman student Assalayana,<br />
					"Master Assalayana,<br />
					this Gotama the contemplative<br />
					prescribes purity for the four castes.<br />
					Come and dispute with him on this statement,<br />
					for you have lived the life of a wanderer.<br />
					Don't be defeated without being defeated in battle."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the brahman student Assalayana said to the brahmans,<br />
					"Apparently, sirs,<br />
					I don't get leave from you<br />
					(to avoid the matter by saying),<br />
					'Gotama the contemplative<br />
					is one who speaks Dhamma.<br />
					And those who speak Dhamma<br />
					are hard to dispute with.<br />
					I can't dispute with him on this statement.'<br />
					But at your bidding I will go."</p>

					<p class="f4">The the brahman student Assalayana<br />
					went with a large group of brahmans<br />
					to the Blessed One and, on arrival,<br />
					exchanged courteous greetings with him.<br />
					After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies,<br />
					he sat to one side.<br />
					As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, the brahmans say,<br />
					'Brahmans are the superior caste;<br />
					any other caste is inferior.<br />
					Only brahmans are the fair caste;<br />
					any other caste is dark.<br />
					Only brahmans are pure,<br />
					not non-brahmans.<br />
					Only brahmans are the sons and offspring of Brahma:<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of Brahma,<br />
					created by Brahma,<br />
					heirs of Brahma.'<br />
					What does Master Gotama have to say with regard to that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Assalayana,<br />
					the brahmans' brahman-women<br />
					are plainly seen having their periods,<br />
					becoming pregnant,<br />
					giving birth,<br />
					and nursing [their children].<br />
					And yet the brahmans,<br />
					being born through the birth canal, say,<br />
					'Brahmans are the superior caste;<br />
					any other caste is inferior.<br />
					Only brahmans are the fair caste;<br />
					any other caste is dark.<br />
					Only brahmans are pure,<br />
					not non-brahmans.<br />
					Only brahmans are the sons and offspring of Brahma:<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of Brahma,<br />
					created by Brahma,<br />
					heirs of Brahma.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even though Master Gotama says that,<br />

					created by Brahma,<br />
					heirs of Brahma.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Assalayana?<br />
					Have you heard that in Yana and Kamboja<br />
					and other outlying countries<br />
					there are only two castes<br />
					&mdash; masters and slaves &mdash;<br />
					and that having been a master<br />
					one (can) become a slave,<br />
					and that having been a slave<br />
					one (can) become a master?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Master Gotama..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So what strength is there, Assalayana,<br />
					what assurance,<br />
					when the brahmans say,<br />
					'Brahmans are the superior caste...<br />
					the sons and offspring of Brahma:<br />

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Assalayana?<br />

					<p class="f4">Then the seer<br />

					<p class="f4">So, arranging his hair and beard,<br />

					Well, now, where have these masters,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then the seven brahman seers<br />

					Well, now, where have these masters,<br />

					Let's curse him!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the seven brahman seers<br />

					"Be ashes, dribble-spit!<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					Be ashes, dribble-spit!<br />

					<p class="f4">But the more they cursed him,<br />
					the more beautiful,<br />
					good-looking,<br />
					and inspiring he became.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to the seven brahman seers,<br />
					'Our asceticism is in vain!<br />
					Our holy-life is fruitless!<br />
					For before, whenever we cursed anyone,<br />
					"Be ashes, dribble-spit!"<br />
					he would always become ashes.<br />
					But the more we curse this one,<br />
					the more beautiful,<br />
					good-looking,<br />
					and inspiring he becomes!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Masters, your asceticism is not in vain,<br />
					and your holy-life not fruitless.<br />
					Please, masters,<br />
					abandon your hatred toward me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'We abandon our hatred toward you, master.<br />
					Who are you?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Have you heard of the seer Devala the Dark?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am he.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the seven brahman seers approached him<br />
					to bow down to him,<br />
					and he said to them,<br />
					'I have heard that this evil viewpoint has arisen<br />
					in the seven brahman seers<br />
					as they are consulting together<br />
					in leaf huts in the wilderness:<br />
					"Brahmans are the superior caste;<br />
					any other caste is inferior...<br />
					Only brahmans are the sons and offspring of Brahma:<br />
					born of his mouth,<br />
					born of Brahma,<br />
					created by Brahma,<br />
					heirs of Brahma."'</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is so, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'But do you know, masters,<br />
					if the mother who bore you<br />
					went only with a brahman,<br />
					and not with a non-brahman?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And do you know<br />
					if the mothers of the mother who bore you<br />
					&mdash; back seven generations of mothers &mdash;<br />
					went only with brahmans,<br />
					and not with non-brahmans?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And do you know<br />
					if the father who sired you<br />
					went only with a brahman woman,<br />
					and not with a non-brahman woman?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And do you know<br />
					if the fathers of the father who bore you<br />
					&mdash; back seven generations of fathers &mdash;<br />
					went only with brahman women,<br />
					and not with non-brahman women?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Do you know how there is the descent of an embryo?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, master, we know how there is the descent of an embryo.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where the mother and father have come together,<br />
					the mother is fertile,<br />
					and a <i>gandhabba</i> [the being about to be reborn]<br />
					is standing present.<br />
					The coming together of these three<br />
					is the descent of the embryo.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'But do you know for sure<br />
					whether the gandhabba is a noble warrior,<br />
					a brahman,<br />
					a merchant,<br />
					or a worker?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, master.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'That being the case,<br />
					do you know who you are?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'That being the case, master,<br />
					we don't know who we are.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Assalayana,<br />
					when those seven brahman seers<br />
					couldn't defend their own birth-statement<br />
					when interrogated,<br />
					pressed,<br />
					and rebuked by the seer Devala the Dark,<br />
					how can you now defend<br />
					your own birth-statement<br />
					when interrogated,<br />
					pressed,<br />
					and rebuked by me</p>

					<p class="f4">&mdash; you, their lineage holder,<br />
					but not (the equal of) Punna,<br />
					their ladle holder?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					the brahman student Assalayana said to the Blessed One:<br />
					Magnificent, Master Gotama!<br />
					Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright<br />
					what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way<br />
					to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has Master Gotama<br />
					&mdash; through many lines of reasoning &mdash;<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to Master Gotama for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the Saŋgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama remember me<br />
					as a lay follower<br />
					who has gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forward,<br />
					for life."</p>
