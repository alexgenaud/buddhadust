Sāriputta, Ven. Mahā Moggallāna, Ven. Mahā Kassapa, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita, Ven. Mahā Kappina, Ven. Mahā Cunda, Ven. Revata, Ven.

					<p class="f4">On that occasion the elder monks were teaching &amp; instructing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Some elder monks were teaching &amp; instructing ten monks, some were teaching &amp; instructing twenty monks, some were teaching &amp; instructing thirty monks, some were teaching &amp; instructing forty monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The new monks, being taught &amp; instructed by the elder monks, were discerning grand, successive distinctions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion — the uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night of the Pavāraṇā ceremony — the Blessed One was seated in the open air surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Surveying the silent Saṅgha of monks, he addressed them:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks, I am content with this practice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am content at heart with this practice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So arouse even more intense persistence for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<h4>The Four Establishings of Mindfulness</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culmination?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[1] On whatever occasion a monk breathing in long discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, discerns, 'I am breathing out long'; or breathing in short, discerns, 'I am breathing in short'; or breathing out short, discerns, 'I am breathing out short'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;... out sensitive to the entire body'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out calming bodily fabrication':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I tell you, monks, that this — the in-&amp;-out breath — is classed as a body among bodies, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the body in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[2] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to rapture'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to pleasure'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to mental fabrication'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out calming mental fabrication':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>feelings</i> in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I tell you, monks, that this — careful attention to in-&amp;-out breaths — is classed as a feeling among feelings,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on feelings in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[3] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out sensitive to the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out gladdening the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out steadying the mind'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out releasing the mind':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>mind</i> in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I don't say that there is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing in one of lapsed mindfulness and no alertness, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on the mind in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[4] On whatever occasion a monk trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on inconstancy'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on dispassion'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on cessation'; trains himself, 'I will breathe in...&amp;...out focusing on relinquishing':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On that occasion the monk remains focused on <i>mental qualities</i> in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He who sees with discernment the abandoning of greed &amp; distress is one who watches carefully with equanimity, which is why the monk on that occasion remains focused on mental qualities in &amp; of themselves — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the four establishings of mindfulness to their culmination.</p>
					
					<h4>The Seven Factors for awakening</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how are the four establishings of mindfulness developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[1] On whatever occasion the monk remains focused on the <i>body</i> in &amp; of itself — ardent, alert, &amp; mindful — subduing greed &amp; distress with reference to the world, on that occasion his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When his mindfulness is steady &amp; without lapse, then <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[2] Remaining mindful in this way, he examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he remains mindful in this way, examining, analyzing, &amp; coming to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[3] In one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, persistence is aroused unflaggingly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When persistence is aroused unflaggingly in one who examines, analyzes, &amp; comes to a comprehension of that quality with discernment, then <i>persistence</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[4] In one whose persistence is aroused, a rapture not of the flesh arises.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When a rapture not of the flesh arises in one whose persistence is aroused, then <i>rapture</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[5] For one enraptured at heart, the body grows calm and the mind grows calm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the body &amp; mind of a monk enraptured at heart grow calm, then <i>calm</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[6] For one who is at ease — his body calmed — the mind becomes concentrated.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the mind of one who is at ease — his body calmed — becomes concentrated, then <i>concentration</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"[7] He carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he carefully watches the mind thus concentrated with equanimity, <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for awakening becomes aroused.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops it, and for him it goes to the culmination of its development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[Similarly with the other three establishings of mindfulness: feelings, mind, &amp; mental qualities.]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is how the four establishings of mindfulness are developed &amp; pursued so as to bring the seven factors for awakening to their culmination.</p>
					
					<h4>Clear Knowing <i>&amp;</i> Release</h4>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how are the seven factors for awakening developed &amp; pursued so as to bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk develops <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He develops <i>analysis of qualities</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>persistence</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>rapture</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>calm</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>concentration</i> as a factor for awakening... <i>equanimity</i> as a factor for awakening dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is how the seven factors for awakening are developed &amp; pursued so as to bring clear knowing &amp; release to their culmination."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> To the fore <i>(parimukhaṁ):</i> The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach to this term, defining it as around <i>(pari-)</i> the mouth <i>(mukhaṁ).</i> In the Vinaya, however, it is used in a context (Cv.V.27.4) where it undoubtedly means the front of the chest. There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically as "to the front," which is how I have translated it here.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>"Body means the breath". What this means is that what body is at it's most fundamental is the breath. The body, as we understand it as humans is an illusion which eminates from the breath. It is the same for 'perception' 'experience', 'own-making' and 'consciousness'. The next term should be read as: 'breath is fabrication of body'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The commentaries insist that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this context, for the next step — without further explanation — refers to the breath as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms to refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful to signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does below, when explaining that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice of focusing on the body in &amp; of itself as a frame of reference). The step of breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to the many similes in the suttas depicting jhāna as a state of whole-body awareness (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p119">MN 119</a>).</p>
