					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Samiddhi, as night was ending, got up and went to the Tapodā Hot Springs to bathe his limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having bathed his limbs and gotten out of the springs, he stood wearing only his lower robe, letting his limbs return to normal.<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a certain devatā, in the far extreme of the night, her extreme radiance lighting up the entire Tapodā Hot Springs, went to Ven. Samiddhi and, on arrival, stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she was standing there, she said to him, "Monk, have you memorized the summary and analysis of the auspicious day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend, I haven't memorized the summary and analysis of the auspicious day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have <i>you</i> memorized the summary and analysis of the auspicious day?".</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, monk, I, too, haven't memorized the summary and analysis of the auspicious day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you memorized the verses of the auspicious day?.</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, friend, I haven't memorized the verses of the auspicious day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you memorized the verses of the auspicious day?".</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, monk, I, too, haven't memorized the verses of the auspicious day.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Learn the summary and analysis of the auspicious day, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Master the summary and analysis of the auspicious day, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Remember the summary and analysis of the auspicious day, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Connected with the goal are the summary and analysis of the auspicious day, monk, and basic to the holy life.".</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the devatā said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said it, she vanished right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when night had ended, Ven. Samiddhi went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he [told the Blessed One what had happened, adding:] "It would be good, lord, if you would teach me the summary and analysis of the auspicious day.".</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, monk, listen well and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak.".</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Samiddhi responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"You shouldn't chase after the past<br />
							or place expectations on the future.<br />
							What is past<br />
							is left behind.<br />
							The future<br />
							is as yet unreached.<br />
							Whatever quality is present<br />
							you clearly see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right there,<br />
							right there.<br />
							Not taken in,<br />
							unshaken,<br />
							that's how you develop the heart.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Ardently doing<br />
							what should be done&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today,<br />
							for — who knows? —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomorrow<br />
							death.<br />
							There is no bargaining<br />
							with Mortality and his mighty horde.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever lives thus ardently,<br />
							relentlessly<br />
							both day and night,<br />
							has truly had an auspicious day:<br />
							So says the Peaceful Sage."</p>

					<p>That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said it, the One Well-Gone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred to the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning—</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"You shouldn't chase after the past<br />
							or place expectations on the future.<br />
							What is past<br />
							is left behind.<br />
							The future<br />
							is as yet unreached.<br />
							Whatever quality is present<br />
							you clearly see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right there,<br />
							right there.<br />
							Not taken in,<br />
							unshaken,<br />
							that's how you develop the heart.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Ardently doing<br />
							what should be done&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today,<br />
							for — who knows? —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomorrow<br />
							death.<br />
							There is no bargaining<br />
							with Mortality and his mighty horde.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever lives thus ardently,<br />
							relentlessly<br />
							both day and night,<br />
							has truly had an auspicious day:<br />
							So says the Peaceful Sage."</p>

					<p>"Now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to them,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ven. Mahā Kaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his observant companions in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose we were to go to him and, on arrival, cross-question him about this matter."</p>

					<p class="f4">So the monks went to Ven. Mahā Kaccāna and, on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, they sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened, and added,]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Analyze the meaning, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna!".</p>

					<p class="f4">[He replied:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, it's as if a man needing heartwood, looking for heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood — passing over the root and trunk of a standing tree possessing heartwood — were to imagine that heartwood should be sought among its branches and leaves.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is with you, who—having bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him, the Teacher — imagine that I should be asked about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">For knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was the time when you should have questioned him about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">However he answered, that was how you should have remembered it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend Kaccāna: Knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahmā.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">However he answered, that was how we should have remembered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">But you are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your observant companions in the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">You are capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Analyze the meaning, Ven. Mahā Kaccāna, without making it difficult!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, my friends, listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak.".</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, friend," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Mahā Kaccāna said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"You shouldn't chase after the past<br />
							or place expectations on the future.<br />
							What is past<br />
							is left behind.<br />
							The future<br />
							is as yet unreached.<br />
							Whatever quality is present<br />
							you clearly see&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;right there,<br />
							right there.<br />
							Not taken in,<br />
							unshaken,<br />
							that's how you develop the heart.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Ardently doing<br />
							what should be done&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today,<br />
							for — who knows? —&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tomorrow<br />

							There is no bargaining<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever lives thus ardently,<br />
							relentlessly<br />
							both day and night,<br />
							has truly had an auspicious day:<br />
							So says the Peaceful Sage."</p>

					<p>"I understand the detailed meaning to be this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, friends, does one chase after the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness gets carried away with the desire and passion of 'In the past I had such an eye and such forms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness gets carried away with desire and passion, one delights there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one chases after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness gets carried away with the desire and passion of 'In the past I had such an ear and such sounds'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a nose and such aromas'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a tongue and such flavors'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a body and such tactile sensations'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such an intellect and such ideas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness gets carried away with desire and passion, one delights there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one chases after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one chases after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one not chase after the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness does not get carried away with the desire and passion of 'In the past I had such an eye and such forms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness does not get carried away with desire and passion, one doesn't delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one doesn't chase after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness does not get carried away with the desire and passion of 'In the past I had such an ear and such sounds'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a nose and such aromas'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a tongue and such flavors'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such a body and such tactile sensations'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the past I had such an intellect and such ideas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness does not get carried away with desire and passion, one doesn't delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one doesn't chase after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one doesn't chase after the past.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one place expectations on the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">One directs one's heart to the attainment of what hasn't been attained:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the future may I have such an eye and such forms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the directing of awareness as a condition, there is delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one places expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One directs one's heart to the attainment of what hasn't been attained:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the future may I have such an ear and such sounds'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a nose and such aromas'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a tongue and such flavors'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a body and such tactile sensations'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such an intellect and such ideas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the directing of awareness as a condition, there is delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one places expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one places expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one not place expectations on the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">One doesn't direct one's heart to the attainment of what hasn't been attained:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the future may I have such an eye and such forms.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the non-directing of awareness as a condition, there is no delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one doesn't place expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"One doesn't direct one's heart to the attainment of what hasn't been attained:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the future may I have such an ear and such sounds'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a nose and such aromas'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a tongue and such flavors'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such a body and such tactile sensations'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'In the future may I have such an intellect and such ideas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the non-directing of awareness as a condition, there is no delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one does not place expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one doesn't place expectations on the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one taken in with regard to present qualities?.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to the eye and forms that are both present, consciousness gets carried away with the desire and passion for what is present.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness gets carried away with desire and passion, one delights there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one is taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to the ear and sounds that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the nose and aromas that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the tongue and flavors that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the body and tactile sensations that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to the intellect and ideas that are both present, consciousness gets carried away with the desire and passion for what is present.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness gets carried away with desire and passion, one delights there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delighting there, one is taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one is taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one not taken in with regard to present qualities?.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to the eye and forms that are both present, consciousness doesn't get carried away with the desire and passion for what is present.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness doesn't get carried away with desire and passion, one doesn't delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one isn't taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to the ear and sounds that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the nose and aromas that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the tongue and flavors that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">... the body and tactile sensations that are both present ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to the intellect and ideas that are both present, consciousness doesn't get carried away with the desire and passion for what is present.</p>

					<p class="f4">When consciousness doesn't get carried away with desire and passion, one doesn't delight there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not delighting there, one isn't taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one isn't taken in with regard to present qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"You shouldn't chase after the past<br />
							or place expectations on the future.<br />
							What is past<br />
							is left behind.<br />
							The future<br />
							is as yet unreached.<br />
							Whatever quality is present<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Ardently doing<br />

							There is no bargaining<br />

							<p class="f4 in2">Whoever lives thus ardently,<br />
							relentlessly<br />
							both day and night,<br />
							has truly had an auspicious day:<br />
							So says the Peaceful Sage."</p>

					<p>this is how I understand the detailed meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, friends, if you wish, having gone to the Blessed One, question him about this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">However he answers is how you should remember it.".</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monks, delighting in and approving of Ven. Mahā Kaccāna's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they [told him what had happened after he had gone into his dwelling, and ended by saying,]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Ven. Mahā Kaccāna analyzed the meaning using these words, these statements, these phrases."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mahā Kaccāna is wise, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is a person of great discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you had asked me about this matter, I too would have answered in the same way he did.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is its meaning, and that is how you should remember it.".</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
