					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what, monks, is noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions?</p>

					<p class="f4">Any singleness of mind equipped with these seven factors — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness — is called noble right concentration with its supports and requisite conditions.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> It has been argued that this definition of right concentration differs from the standard definition that equates right concentration with the four jhānas. This argument, however, misses two points. The first is that this definition differs in no way from the opening part of the definition of the first jhāna: "There is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhāna." The "unskillful qualities" in this passage are identified by <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_45_maggasamyutta.htm#p22">SN 45:22</a> as "wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration." And of course, sensuality is renounced through mundane right resolve. In fact, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p78">MN 78</a> indicates a direct connection between right resolve and jhāna, stating that the first jhāna is where all unskillful resolves cease without trace. This means that any concentration truly endowed with right resolve would have to be at least the first jhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The second point is that this sutta defines noble right resolve as the resolves present in the first jhāna. See note 5, below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">So there is nothing to indicate that this definition of right concentration refers to anything but jhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p41">MN 41, note 5</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> These various factors are all equivalent to knowledge in terms of the four noble truths. The relationship between these four truths and the issue of skillful and unskillful action is shown in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_46_bojjhangasamyutta.htm#p51">SN 46:51</a>, which notes that analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening is fed by paying appropriate attention to qualities as to whether they are skillful or unskillful. See also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p9">MN 9</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Notice that mindfulness plays an active role here and with all the path factors. It is not simply a receptive acceptance of wrong and right views. Instead — in its canonical sense of keeping something in mind — it keeps remembering to abandon the factors of the wrong path, and to enter and remain in the factors of the right path. For more on the active role of mindfulness in the practice of abandoning unskillful qualities and developing skillful ones, see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p245">AN 4:245</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p63">AN 7:63</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> According to <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">MN 44</a>, verbal fabrications are directed thought and evaluation. The definition of noble right resolve here appears to refer to the resolves present in the first jhāna (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p78">MN 78</a>), thus connecting noble right resolve with right concentration.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_45_maggasamyutta.htm#p8">SN 45:8</a> defines right action as abstaining from killing, abstaining from taking what is not given, and abstaining from uncelibacy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This definition appears to refer to wrong livelihood for monks and nuns.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_48_indriyasamyutta.htm#p46">SN 48:46</a> equates noble release with the faculty of concentration (see also <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_48_indriyasamyutta.htm#p10">SN 48:10</a>).</p>
