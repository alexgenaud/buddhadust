<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 2. The Buddha describes how one who applies his mind studiously to the point is able to rid himself of disrupting influences in seven ways: by seeing them as problems; by self-control, by proper use; by patience; by avoidance; by elimination; and by awakening. Examples of each case are given." />

					<p class="f4">There is the case where an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — doesn't discern what ideas are fit for attention or what ideas are unfit for attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas fit for attention and attends (instead) to ideas unfit for attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming increases; the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ideas unfit for attention that he attends to.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he doesn't attend to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ideas fit for attention that he doesn't attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through his attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his not attending to ideas fit for attention, both unarisen effluents arise in him, and arisen effluents increase.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how he attends inappropriately:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Was I in the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">Was I not in the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">What was I in the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">How was I in the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been what, what was I in the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">Shall I be in the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">Shall I not be in the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">What shall I be in the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">How shall I be in the future?</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been what, what shall I be in the future?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or else he is inwardly perplexed about the immediate present:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Am I?</p>

					<p class="f4">Am I not?</p>

					<p class="f4">What am I?</p>

					<p class="f4">How am I?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where has this being come from?</p>

					<p class="f4">Where is it bound?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he attends inappropriately in this way, one of six kinds of view arises in him:</p>

					<p class="f4">The view <i>I have a self</i> arises in him as true and established, or the view <i>I have no self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of self that I perceive not-self</i> ... or the view <i>It is precisely by means of not-self that I perceive self</i> arises in him as true and established, or else he has a view like this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>This very self of mine — the knower that is sensitive here and there to the ripening of good and bad actions — is the self of mine that is constant, everlasting, eternal, not subject to change, and will endure as long as eternity.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering and stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma — discerns what ideas are fit for attention and what ideas are unfit for attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">This being so, he doesn't attend to ideas unfit for attention and attends (instead) to ideas fit for attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesn't attend to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality arises in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality increases; the unarisen effluent of becoming arises in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming increases; the unarisen effluent of ignorance arises in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance increases.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ideas unfit for attention that he doesn't attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever ideas such that, when he attends to them, the unarisen effluent of sensuality doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of sensuality is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of becoming doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of becoming is abandoned; the unarisen effluent of ignorance doesn't arise in him, and the arisen effluent of ignorance is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ideas fit for attention that he does attend to.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through his not attending to ideas unfit for attention and through his attending to ideas fit for attention, unarisen effluents do not arise in him, and arisen effluents are abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He attends appropriately, <i>This is stress ...</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>This is the origination of stress ...</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>This is the cessation of stress ...</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>This is the way leading to the cessation of stress.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">As he attends appropriately in this way, three fetters are abandoned in him: self-identification view, doubt, and grasping at habits and practices.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called the effluents to be abandoned by seeing.</p>
