<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 2. The Buddha describes how one who applies his mind studiously to the point is able to rid himself of disrupting influences in seven ways: by seeing them as problems; by self-control, by proper use; by patience; by avoidance; by elimination; and by awakening. Examples of each case are given." />

					'Am I?<br />

					What am I?<br />
					How am I?<br />
					Where has this being come from?<br />

					<p class="f4">"As he attends inappropriately in this way,<br />
					one of six kinds of view arises in him:</p>

					<i>This very self of mine —<br />
					the knower that is sensitive here and there<br />

					is the self of mine that is constant,<br />
					everlasting,<br />

					not subject to change,<br />

					<p class="f4">This is called a thicket of views,<br />
