					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p>In this sutta, the Buddha focuses on two points that, he says, distinguish his Dhamma from the teachings of all others. These points are so important that they account for why awakening can be found by following his teachings, but not the teachings of other contemplatives and brahmans.</p>

					<p>The first point is his explanation of how to escape from two types of view: a view of becoming — one that teaches the survival of the self, in one form or another, after death — and a view of non-becoming: one that teaches the annihilation of the self after death.</p>

					<p>The second point is the complete comprehension of clinging that his teaching provides. Other teachings, the Buddha says, may teach the comprehension of up to three types of clinging — sensuality clinging, view clinging, habit-and-practice clinging — but none of them teach the comprehension of a fourth: doctrine-of-self clinging. It's because he teaches the comprehension of all four types of clinging that those who follow his teachings can achieve the various stages of awakening.</p>

					<p>When we look more closely at his discussion of these two points, however, we find that the first point derives from the second: You can escape from views of becoming and non-becoming only by comprehending doctrine-of-self clinging. At the same time, this act of comprehending is nothing other than seeing experience in terms of another one of the Buddha's teachings: dependent co-arising <i>(paṭicca samuppāda).</i> This way of seeing experience is, ultimately, what sets his Dhamma apart.</p>

					<p>Dependent co-arising focuses on the decisive role played by knowledge in terms of the four noble truths in putting an end to clinging, and it's in light of these truths — and the duties appropriate to each — that the importance of the two points highlighted in this sutta is best understood.</p>

					<p>The second noble truth provides the context for the first point. It describes how suffering is caused by any form of craving that leads to further becoming — "becoming" meaning the assumption of an identity in a particular world of experience. There are three types of craving that play this role: craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, and craving for non-becoming. It's easy to see how the first two types of craving might result in becoming, but the way in which craving for non-becoming would also function in this way is less intuitive. Nevertheless, the Buddha stated that one of the most important insights of his awakening was that the act of searching for non-becoming actually entailed further becoming (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p49">MN 49</a>).</p>

					<p>Two passages in the Canon that quote views of non-becoming give a clue as to why: Both define annihilation in terms of the annihilation of a self (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a>; <a href="../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/iti/iti.pali.bd.htm#p49">Iti 49</a>). The fact that both assume a self — a definition of an identity — shows that those who formulate these desires are still thinking in terms of becoming, and these terms will lead them to cling at death, assuming an identity around annihilation and oblivion, which could easily lead them to be reborn in a state of non-perception. This state, though oblivious, nevertheless counts as a state of becoming. On leaving it, the individual then resumes becoming on more conscious levels (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>; <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15</a>).</p>

					<p>The role played by the concept of self in these views of becoming and non-becoming leads to the second point — the importance of comprehending doctrine-of-self clinging — as does the Buddha's statement in this sutta that a person who has escaped from views of becoming and non-becoming has to be someone who is without clinging. The first noble truth defines suffering as clinging to any of the five aggregates, and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">SN 56:11</a> points out that the duty with regard to suffering is to comprehend it. Only then can it by transcended. According to <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p23">SN 22:23</a>, comprehension means understanding in a way that ends passion, aversion, and delusion for what is comprehended. This means that suffering cannot be ended until passion, aversion, and delusion around clinging in all forms related to the aggregates is brought to an end. Now, given the role played by an assumption of self in leading to further becoming, it's obvious that clinging cannot be fully comprehended unless the act of clinging to an assumption framed in terms of "self" is encompassed as well.</p>

					<p>Thus the importance of these two points.</p>

					<p>This leads, however, to a further question: What is the Buddha's strategy for implementing these two points? In other words, how does he avoid views of becoming and non-becoming? And how does he propose to end passion, aversion, and delusion for all doctrines of the self? Both issues present tactical challenges, for it would be all too easy to end passion for a particular view or doctrine by developing aversion for it, which would mean that it wasn't fully comprehended. At the same time, adopting an agnostic position toward views and doctrines — saying, for instance, that one doesn't know what happens to the self after death — would count as delusion. And as the Buddha himself points out in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p81">SN 22:81</a>, agnosticism is a view that can be an object of clinging as much as any other view.</p>

					<p>With regard to the first point: The Buddha follows at least two strategies in dealing with views about what happens at death. On a basic level, he explains the process of rebirth without reference to a self. In other words, he discusses <i>how</i> rebirth happens without defining <i>what</i> gets reborn (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_44_avyakatasamyutta.htm#p9">SN 44:9</a>), for knowledge of the <i>how</i> is sufficient for putting an end to the process. On a more subtle level, he focuses not on the position taken by a view about survival after death, but on the act of creating and clinging to such a view.</p>

					<p>He explains this approach in a variety of ways in different suttas. Here in MN 11, he divides his analysis into two parts. The first part comes right after the definition of the two types of views. There he states simply that those who discern, as they have come to be, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks of — and the escape from — these two views are free from clinging and craving, and so are released from suffering and stress.</p>

					<p>The second part of this analysis comes at the end of the sutta, where the Buddha analyzes the origination and passing away of views by listing the causal factors in dependent co-arising that lead to the act of clinging — including the act of clinging to views — tracing them back to ignorance. According to <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_12_nidanasamyutta.htm#p2">SN 12:2</a>, ignorance in this context means "not knowing stress, not knowing the origination of stress, not knowing the cessation of stress, not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress," i.e., not knowing the four noble truths. Because all clinging ends when ignorance ends and clear-knowing arises, clinging to views ends when one has mastered the duties appropriate to each of these truths (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">SN 56:11</a>). In other words, the true abandoning of views comes not through agnosticism but through knowledge of the processes by which views are formed and of the way to bring those processes to an end. The escape from views occurs when there is dispassion for ignorance and all the factors it engenders.</p>

					<p>Other suttas help to further flesh out the four steps leading to escape from views. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a>, for instance, lists various views of becoming and non-becoming, explaining the allure of some of those views by quoting the arguments their proponents give for them. It also points out the major drawback of views of non-becoming, observing that they inevitably lead to further becoming. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> explains that all views originate in contact, and pass away when contact ceases. This is a step in dependent co-arising. The same sutta also discusses the drawbacks of views in terms of the destination to which they lead. This relates to the Buddha's insight on the night of his awakening, that views influence actions, and actions influence the way beings are reborn (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p4">MN 4</a>). <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p93">AN 10:93</a> points out the present-moment drawbacks of clinging to views: Given that all views are fabricated, and all fabrications are inconstant and stressful, to cling to a view is to subject oneself to stress. The implication in all cases is that, no matter how alluring a view may be, its allure is far outweighed by its drawbacks. When this realization hits home, dispassion arises, which in turn provides the escape from views.</p>

					<p>It's in this way, by focusing on views as actions and avoiding the terms in which the views are expressed, that the Buddha can teach the ending of passion, aversion, and delusion with regard to all views.</p>

					<p>Now, the way in which he avoids the concept of "self" central to views of becoming and non-becoming derives from his strategic approach to the second point. Instead of offering, as an alternative to doctrines of the self, a doctrine that there is no self, he rejects the questions that frame such views to begin with. In <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN 2</a>, he says that such questions as, "What am I? Do I exist? Do I not exist" are not appropriate objects of attention. Further, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p2">MN 2</a> lists the view "I have no self" together with the view "I have a self" as "a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. Bound by a fetter of views, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is not freed from birth, aging, and death, from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair. He is not freed, I tell you, from suffering and stress." In other words, the doctrine that there is no self can act as an object of clinging just as much as the doctrine that there is a self. As an object of clinging, it can just as easily lead to further becoming.</p>

					<p>So instead of counteracting doctrine-of-self clinging with a doctrine that there is no self, the Buddha does something much more radical: He offers a way of viewing experience in which questions concerning the existence or non-existence of the self are put aside. His most elaborate exposition of this view is dependent co-arising, part of which — the part tracing the causal factors for clinging back to ignorance — is given at the conclusion of this sutta. This view, instead of requiring a framework of "self" or "world" to explain it, provides a framework for understanding how views of "self" and "world" develop to begin with, and how they can be brought to an end. In this way, dependent co-arising provides an escape from the terms that would lead to views of becoming, non-becoming, and any doctrine of the self.</p>

					<p>And, as Anāthapiṇḍika — one of the Buddha's lay followers — explains in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p93">AN 10:93</a>, the right view that puts an end to ignorance in turn provides the seeds for its own transcendence, undercutting any temptation to treat it, too, as an object of clinging: "Venerable sirs, whatever has been brought into being, is fabricated, willed, dependently co-arisen: That is inconstant. Whatever is inconstant is stress. Whatever is stress is not me, is not what I am, is not my self. Having seen this well with right discernment as it has come to be, I also discern the higher escape from it as it has come to be."</p>

					<p>So in both cases — his treatment of views of becoming and non-becoming, and his treatment of doctrine-of-self clinging — the Buddha shows what is truly distinctive in his approach to freeing the mind: avoiding clinging not only to the objects of views but also to the process of view-making itself, as explained in the terms of dependent co-arising. It does this by focusing on comprehending that process in a way that develops dispassion for it. That dispassion then provides the only escape: the opening to the experience of awakening.</p>

					<p>This is why awakening occurs only in a Dhamma that teaches the points highlighted in this sutta.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for the sake of this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The four contemplatives are the four grades of noble disciples: the stream-winner, the once-returner, the non-returner, and the arahant. See the Buddha's conversation with Subhadda the wanderer in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">DN 16</a>. For descriptions of these four grades, see the beginning passages in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Papañca.</i> On the topic of objectification, see the introduction to <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p18">MN 18</a> and the essay, "The Arrows of Thinking." <i>Nippapañca,</i> non-objectification, is listed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm">SN 43</a> as an epithet of unbinding <i>(nibbāna).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The view of becoming describes the survival of the self after death. The view of non-becoming describes the annihilation of the self at death. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> lists 32 views of becoming and seven views of non-becoming. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p102">MN 102</a> gathers a large number of views of becoming — some of which are not listed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> — under three headings: those that describe the self after death as percipient, non-percipient, or neither percipient nor non-percipient. It treats all views of non-becoming as a single type. See the introductions to both of these suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The fact that views of becoming and non-becoming cannot be comprehended until doctrine-of-self clinging has been comprehended raises a question here: When the Buddha says that other contemplatives and brahmans have taught the comprehension view-clinging, what does he mean?</p>

					<p class="f4">It can't mean that they have successfully taught how to comprehend view-clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, it must mean that they have <i>advocated</i> comprehending view-clinging, but have not successfully taught how to do it.</p>
