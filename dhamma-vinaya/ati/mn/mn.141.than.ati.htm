There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, at Varanasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Tathāgatha — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by priest or contemplative, deity, Mara, or Brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos: in other words, the declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of the noble truth of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">The declaration, teaching, description, setting forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of the noble truth of the origination of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the cessation of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">At Varanasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Tathāgatha — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by priest or contemplative, deity, Mara, or Brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos: in other words, the declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of these four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, associate with Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Consort with Sāriputta and Moggallāna. They are wise monks, sympathetic toward their fellows in the holy life. Like the mother giving birth: That's Sāriputta. Like the nurse raising a child after it's born: That's Moggallāna. Sāriputta trains [others] to the fruit of stream-entry; Moggallāna, to the highest goal.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Sāriputta is capable of declaring, teaching, describing, setting forth, revealing, explaining, and making plain the four noble truths in detail."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, he — the One Well-gone — rose from his seat and entered his dwelling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, not long after the Blessed One had left, addressed the monks, "Friends!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, at Varanasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Tathāgatha — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by priest or contemplative, deity, Mara, or Brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos: in other words, the declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of the noble truth of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the origination of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the cessation of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">At Varanasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Tathāgatha — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by priest or contemplative, deity, Mara, or Brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos: in other words, the declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of these four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what, friends, is the noble truth of stress?</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is stressful,<br />
					aging is stressful,<br />
					death is stressful;<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					distress,<br />
					and despair are stressful;<br />
					association with the unbeloved is stressful;<br />
					separation from the loved is stressful;<br />
					not getting what is wanted is stressful.<br />
					In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>birth?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever birth,<br />
					taking birth,<br />
					descent,<br />
					coming-to-be,<br />
					coming-forth,<br />
					appearance of aggregates,<br />
					and acquisition of [sense] spheres<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>aging?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever aging,<br />
					decrepitude,<br />
					brokenness,<br />
					graying,<br />
					wrinkling,<br />
					decline of life-force,<br />
					weakening of the faculties<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called aging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>death?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever deceasing,<br />
					passing away,<br />
					breaking up,<br />
					disappearance,<br />
					dying,<br />
					death,<br />
					completion of time,<br />
					break up of the aggregates,<br />
					casting off of the body,<br />
					interruption in the life faculty<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called death.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>sorrow?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever sorrow,<br />
					sorrowing,<br />
					sadness,<br />
					inward sorrow,<br />
					inward sadness<br />
					of anyone suffering from misfortune,<br />
					touched by a painful thing,<br />
					that is called sorrow.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>lamentation?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever crying,<br />
					grieving,<br />
					lamenting,<br />
					weeping,<br />
					wailing,<br />
					lamentation of anyone suffering from misfortune,<br />
					touched by a painful thing,<br />
					that is called lamentation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>pain?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is experienced as bodily pain,<br />
					bodily discomfort,<br />
					pain or discomfort born of bodily contact,<br />
					that is called pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>distress?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is experienced as mental pain,<br />
					mental discomfort,<br />
					pain or discomfort born of mental contact,<br />
					that is called distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is <i>despair?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever despair,<br />
					despondency,<br />
					desperation of anyone suffering from misfortune,<br />
					touched by a painful thing,<br />
					that is called despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the stress of <i>association with the unbeloved?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where undesirable, unpleasing, unattractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations occur to one;<br />
					or one has connection, contact, relationship, interaction with those who wish one ill,<br />
					who wish for one's harm,<br />
					who wish for one's discomfort,<br />
					who wish one no security from the yoke.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the stress of association with the unbeloved.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the stress of <i>separation from the loved?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where desirable, pleasing, attractive sights, sounds, aromas, flavors, or tactile sensations do not occur to one;<br />
					or one has no connection, no contact, no relationship, no interaction with those who wish one well,<br />
					who wish for one's benefit,<br />
					who wish for one's comfort,<br />
					who wish one security from the yoke,<br />
					nor with one's mother, father, brother, sister, friends, companions, or relatives.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the stress of separation from the loved.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the stress of <i>not getting what is wanted?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In beings subject to birth,<br />
					the wish arises,<br />
					'O, may we not be subject to birth,<br />
					and may birth not come to us.'<br />
					But this is not to be achieved by wanting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the stress of not getting what is wanted.</p>

					<p class="f4">In beings subject to aging...<br />
					illness...<br />
					death...<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					distress,<br />
					and despair, the wish arises,<br />
					'O, may we not be subject to aging...<br />
					illness...<br />
					death...<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					distress,<br />
					and despair,<br />
					and may aging...<br />
					illness...<br />
					death...<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain, distress,<br />
					and despair not come to us.'<br />
					But this is not to be achieved by wanting.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the stress of not getting what is wanted.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the <i>five clinging-aggregates </i>that, in short, are stressful?</p>

					<p class="f4">The clinging-aggregate of form,<br />
					the clinging-aggregate of feeling,<br />
					the clinging-aggregate of perception,<br />
					the clinging-aggregate of fabrications,<br />
					the clinging-aggregate of consciousness:</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called the five clinging-aggregates that, in short, are stressful.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, friends, is called the noble truth of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, friends, is the noble truth of the origination of stress?</p>

					<p class="f4">The craving that makes for further becoming<br />
					— accompanied by passion and delight,<br />
					relishing now here and now there —<br />
					i.e., craving for sensuality,<br />
					craving for becoming,<br />
					craving for non-becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is called the noble truth of the origination of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, friends, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress?</p>

					<p class="f4">The remainderless fading and cessation,<br />
					renunciation,<br />
					relinquishment,<br />
					release,<br />
					and letting go of that very craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is called the noble truth of the cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, friends, is the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this very noble eightfold path:<br />
					right view,<br />
					right resolve,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right view?</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge with reference to stress,<br />
					knowledge with reference to the origination of stress,<br />
					knowledge with reference to the cessation of stress,<br />
					knowledge with reference to the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress:<br />
					This is called right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is right resolve?</p>

					<p class="f4">The resolve for renunciation,<br />
					for freedom from ill will,<br />
					for harmlessness:<br />
					This is called right resolve.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from lying,<br />
					from divisive speech,<br />
					from abusive speech,<br />
					and from idle chatter:<br />
					This is called right speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right action?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from taking life,<br />
					from stealing,<br />
					and from sexual misconduct:<br />
					This is called right action.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right livelihood?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones,<br />
					having abandoned dishonest livelihood,<br />
					keeps his life going with right livelihood:<br />
					This is called right livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk generates desire,<br />
					endeavors,<br />
					arouses persistence,<br />
					upholds and exerts his intent<br />
					for the sake of the non-arising<br />
					of evil, unskillful qualities<br />
					that have not yet arisen...<br />
					for the sake of the abandoning<br />
					of evil, unskillful qualities<br />
					that have arisen...<br />
					for the sake of the arising<br />
					of skillful qualities<br />
					that have not yet arisen... <i>(and)</i><br />
					for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, and culmination<br />
					of skillful qualities<br />
					that have arisen:<br />
					This is called right effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself<br />
					— ardent, alert, and mindful —<br />
					putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.<br />
					He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves...<br />
					the mind in and of itself...<br />
					mental qualities in and of themselves<br />
					— ardent, alert, and mindful —<br />
					putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called right mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is right concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk<br />
					— quite withdrawn from sensuality,<br />
					withdrawn from unskillful <i>(mental)</i> qualities —<br />
					enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the stilling of directed thought and evaluation,<br />
					he enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of composure,<br />
					unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading of rapture<br />
					he remains in equanimity, mindful and alert, physically sensitive of pleasure.<br />
					He enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasurable abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress —<br />
					he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is called the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, at Varanasi, in the Game Refuge at Isipatana, the Tathāgatha — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — set in motion the unexcelled Wheel of Dhamma that cannot be stopped by priest or contemplative, deity, Mara, or Brahma or anyone at all in the cosmos: in other words, the declaration, teaching, description, setting-forth, revelation, explanation, and making-plain of these four noble truths."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ven. Sāriputta said. Gratified, the monks delighted in Ven. Sāriputta's words.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Buddha declared Sāriputta to be foremost among his disciples in terms of discernment; Moggallāna, foremost in terms of psychic powers. It might seem strange, then, that Sāriputta takes on what seems to be a lower job, but as many Buddhist teachers have commented, it is much harder to train an ordinary person to enter the stream than it is to train a stream-winner to reach the highest goal.</p>
