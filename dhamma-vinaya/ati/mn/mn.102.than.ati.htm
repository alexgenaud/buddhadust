					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

            	<p><i>This discourse has two striking features. The first is that it seems to contain an interpolation. The introduction summarizes the topic of the discourse: five alternative ways in which a person might theorize or speculate about the future state of a person after death. What seems to be the interpolation begins after the first four ways have been discussed, and there are two reasons for regarding it as a later addition. (1) It announces that all five alternatives mentioned in the summary have been discussed, whereas only four have. (2) It then treats a topic not mentioned in the summary at all: alternatives ways in which a person might speculate about the past. Only when this section is finished does the discourse pick up the fifth alternative mentioned in the introductory summary.</i></p>

            	<p><i>Because this apparent interpolation interrupts the flow of the discourse, I have here translated just the remaining parts, to give some sense of how they fit together without the interruption.</i></p>

            	<p><i>The second striking feature of the discourse is its resemblance to <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> in covering two of the three main topics covered by that discourse: speculations about the future and false views of unbinding here-and-now. This resemblance, in fact, may have been what inspired the apparent interpolation, for the third topic covered by <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> — speculations about the past — is precisely the topic covered in that passage. Perhaps the monks who collected, organized, and memorized the Majjhima Nikāya wanted their own discourse treating the same range of topics covered in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>, and so inserted the section on speculations about the past here. (This, by the way, is not to say that this section is less authentic than the rest of the discourse; just that its insertion is awkward. The redactors may have simply borrowed an authentic teaching from another Dhamma talk.)</i></p>

            	<p><i>At any rate, a comparison of the remaining sections with their parallels in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> shows that the Buddha's approach here differs in 3 ways from the approach taken there.</i></p>

            	<p><i>1) To begin with, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a> focuses primary attention on the source of the various speculative views about the future, based on ways in which the self is defined in the present. The Buddha then rejects these views, both on the basis of their sources and on the basis of the future destinations that such views, as actions, lead to after death. Here, however, the Buddha focuses on (a) the ways in which people who hold these views refute one another's views; (b) the Buddha's own refutation of these views, showing either why they make no sense or why they do not lead to freedom from clinging.</i></p>

            	<p><i>2) In <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>, speculations about the future and false views of unbinding here-and-now are treated as two separate categories. Here, false views of unbinding here-and-now are treated as a type of speculation about the future. The reason for this may be that the claim of having attained unbinding carries an implicit claim about the future: There is no further birth for that person (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p29">DN 29</a>, quoted in Skill in Questions).</i></p>

            	<p><i>3) The most interesting difference between the two discourses, however, centers on the final claim to unbinding given here. All the views listed in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>, and all the preceding theories given in this discourse, are attributed to contemplatives who are not followers of the Buddha's teachings. In contrast, this final view could easily be one of a person who has followed the Buddha's instructions but has simply misread his/her ability to complete those instructions, mistaking a state that still harbors some clinging for one that is totally free of it.</i></p>

            	<p><i>It's easy to imagine that the monks listening to this discourse might have been brought up short by this last example. After hearing of the failings of contemplatives outside the Buddha's teachings, they are presented with a failing to which they themselves could easily fall prey.</i></p>

            	<p><i>This discourse thus contains a useful warning for Buddhist meditators today.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This is apparently equivalent to the formless attainment of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, which <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p106">MN 106</a> classes as imperturbable. <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p29">AN 10:29</a> has this to say about the consciousness-totality:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"There are these ten totality-dimensions. Which ten? One perceives the earth-totality above, below, all-around: non-dual <i>[advayaɱ],</i> immeasurable. One perceives the water-totality... the fire-totality... the wind-totality... the blue-totality... the yellow-totality... the red-totality... the white-totality... the space-totality... the consciousness-totality above, below, all-around: non-dual, immeasurable. These are the ten totality-dimensions. Now, of these ten totality-dimensions, this is supreme: when one perceives the consciousness-totality above, below, all-around: non-dual, immeasurable. And there are beings who are percipient in this way. Yet even in the beings who are percipient in this way there is still aberration, there is change. Seeing this, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with that.

This changes the meaning of the last sentence in each of these passages with regard to what is meant by "that" in the phrase, "Knowing that."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Unlike the contemplatives and brahmans quoted in this passage, the Buddha—in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p106">MN 106</a>—does not apply the adjective "imperturbable" to the dimension of nothingness. See note 1 to that sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> See <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p54">SN 22:54</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Craving for non-becoming <i>(vibhava-taṇhā)</i> is one of the three types of craving that lead to becoming. On this point, see, <i>The Paradox of Becoming.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The "I am," here, is what points to the clinging. It shows that conceit, one of the ten fetters, has not been cut—"conceit," here, not meaning pride, but simply a sense of what one's identity consists of. As <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p52">MN 52</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p36">AN 9:36</a> point out, it is possible, even when experiencing the deathless, to develop a sense of passion and delight for it, thus giving rise to a subtle sense of "I am" that prevents full awakening. The passage here gives useful directions as to where to look for the lurking clinging that may contribute to that sense of "I am."</p>
              <p>Actual, spontaneous expressions of full awakening are phrased in impersonal terms. See, for instance, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p4">MN 4</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_56_saccasamyutta.htm#p11">SN 56:11</a>, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p49">AN 6:49</a>, and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p59">AN 6:55</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Compare this passage with the refrain in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p1">DN 1</a>:</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"This, monks, the Tathāgata discerns. And he discerns that these standpoints, thus seized, thus grasped at, lead to such &amp; such a destination, to such &amp; such a state in the world beyond. And he discerns what is higher than this. And yet discerning that, he does not grasp at that act of discerning. And as he is not grasping at it, unbinding <i>[nibbuti]</i> is experienced right within. Knowing, as they have come to be, the origin, ending, allure, &amp; drawbacks of feelings, along with the escape from feelings, the Tathāgata, monks—through lack of clinging/sustenance—is released."</p>
