<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Majjhima Nikaya, Sutta 126. The Buddha explains that it is not enough to have hopes, aspirations, yearnings for freedom from pain, one must behave in a way that brings pain to and end for that to happen. He provides four similes to illustrate this point: trying to get oil by pressing sand, trying to get milk by pulling a bull's horn, trying to get butter by churning water, and trying to light a fire with a wet sappy stick." />

					<p class="f4">Then, early in the morning, Ven. Bhūmija — having adjusted his lower robe and taking his bowl and outer robe — went to Prince Jayasena's residence.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince Jayasena went to Ven. Bhūmija and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Bhūmija, "Master Bhūmija, there are some contemplatives and brahmans who espouse this teaching, espouse this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If one follows the holy life, even when having made a wish (for results), one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one follows the holy life even when having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one follows the holy life even when both having made a wish and having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one follows the holy life even when neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to that, what does Master Bhūmija's teacher say, what is his view, what does he declare?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I haven't heard this face to face with the Blessed One, prince, I haven't received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made a wish (for results), one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made no wish... both having made a wish and having made no wish... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">(But) if one follows the holy life appropriately, even when having made a wish, one is capable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one follows the holy life appropriately, even when having made no wish... both having made a wish and having made no wish... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is capable of obtaining results.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I haven't heard this face to face with the Blessed One, I haven't received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If that is what Master Bhūmija's teacher says, if that is his view, if that is what he declares, then yes, Master Bhūmija's teacher stands, as it were, having struck all of those many contemplatives and brahmans down by the head."</p>

					<p class="f4">Prince Jayasena then served Ven. Bhūmija from his own dish of milk rice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Bhūmija, after his meal, returning from his almsround, went to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord, early in the morning — having adjusted my lower robe and taking my bowl and outer robe — I went to Prince Jayasena's residence.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, I sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Prince Jayasena went to me and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with me.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to me, 'Master Bhūmija, there are some contemplatives and brahmans who espouse this teaching, espouse this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one follows the holy life even when having made a wish (for results)... having made no wish... both having made a wish and having made no wish... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results."</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to that, what does Master Bhūmija's teacher say, what is his view, what does he declare?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, I replied to Prince Jayasena, 'I haven't heard this face to face with the Blessed One, prince, I haven't received this face to face with the Blessed One, but there is the possibility that the Blessed One would answer in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">"If one follows the holy life inappropriately, even when having made a wish (for results)... having made no wish... both having made a wish and having made no wish... neither having made a wish nor having made no wish, one is incapable of obtaining results.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Answering in this way when thus asked, lord, am I speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said, am I not misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual, am I answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing me?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, Bhūmija, in answering in this way when thus asked, you are speaking in line with what I have said, you are not misrepresenting me with what is unfactual, and you are answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticizing you.</p>

The churn-stick is a small stick that has attached to its end blocks of wood resembling an orange with alternate sections removed. This is twirled in the curds. The water sprinkled on the curds dilutes the buttermilk, which helps separate it from the milk fat left on the blocks of the churn-stick.</p>
