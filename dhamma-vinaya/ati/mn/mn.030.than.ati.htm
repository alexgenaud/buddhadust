					<p class="f4">Then <a id='pingalakoccha'>Pi&#7749;galakoccha</a> the brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he sitting there, he said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, these contemplatives and brahmans, each with his group, each with his community, each the teacher of his group, an honored leader, well-regarded by people at large — i.e., <a id='purana'>P&#363;ra&#7751;a Kassapa</a>, <a id='makkhali'>Makkhali Gosāla</a>, <a id='ajita'>Ajita Kesakambalin</a>, <a id='pakudha'>Pakudha Kaccāyana</a>, <a id='sanjaya'>Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta</a>, and the <a id='nigantha'>Niga&#7751;ṭha Nāṭaputta</a>:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which, brahman, are the qualities that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="sublime">This is a quality higher and more sublime</a> than knowledge and vision.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress — as with the earlier disappearance of joys and distresses — he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not heeding perceptions of diversity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' he enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' he enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, having seen [that] with discernment, his effluents are completely ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the qualities higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as like the man who, in need of heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood, went off carrying it, knowing, 'heartwood': Whatever heartwood-business he had with heartwood, his purpose will be served.</p>

					<p class="f4">This individual, I tell you, is similar to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, this holy life doesn't have as its reward gain, offerings, and fame,<br />
					doesn't have as its reward consummation of virtue,<br />
					doesn't have as its reward consummation of concentration,<br />
					doesn't have as its reward knowledge and vision,<br />
					but the unprovoked<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> awareness-release:<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id='magnif'></a>When this was said, Pi&#7749;galakoccha the brahman said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here I follow the Thai edition, which reads "son of good family" in this instance, and "individual" in all the remaining instances. Both the Sri Lankan and the Burmese editions read "individual" here and in all the remaining instances.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Commentary explains that the first jhāna is listed as higher than knowledge and vision here because it is being presented in its role as a step toward cessation. The same principle holds for the other stages of concentration up through the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> <i>Akuppa.</i> This term is sometimes translated as "unshakable," but it literally means, "unprovoked." The reference is apparently to the theory of <i>dhātu,</i> or properties underlying physical or psychological events in nature. The physical properties according to this theory are four: earth (solidity), liquid, heat, and wind (motion). Three of them — liquid, heat, and wind — are potentially active. When they are aggravated, agitated, or provoked — the Pali term here, <i>'pakuppati',</i> is used also on the psychological level, where it means angered or upset — they act as the underlying cause for natural activity. When the provocation ends, the corresponding activity subsides.</p>

					<p class="in4">"Now there comes a time, friends, when the external liquid property is provoked, and at that time the external earth property vanishes...</p>

					<p class="in4">"There comes a time, friends, when the external liquid property is provoked and washes away village, town, city, district, and country. There comes a time when the water in the great ocean drops down one hundred leagues, two hundred... three hundred ... four hundred... five hundred... six hundred... seven hundred leagues. There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven palm-trees deep, six... five... four... three... two palm-trees deep, one palm-tree deep. There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands seven fathoms deep, six... five... four... three... two fathoms deep, one fathom deep. There comes a time when the water in the great ocean stands half a fathom deep, hip-deep, knee-deep, ankle deep. There comes a time when the water in the great ocean is not even the depth of the first joint of a finger...</p>

					<p class="in4">"There comes a time, friends, when the external fire property is provoked and consumes village, town, city, district, and country; and then, coming to the edge of a green district, the edge of a road, the edge of a rocky district, to the water's edge, or to a lush, well-watered area, goes out from lack of sustenance. There comes a time when people try to make fire using a wing-bone and tendon parings...</p>

					<p class="in4">"There comes a time, friends, when the external wind property is provoked and blows away village, town, city, district, and country. There comes a time when, in the last month of the hot season, people try to start a breeze with a fan or bellows, and even the grass at the fringe of a thatch roof doesn't stir."<br />
					— <a href='mn.028.than.ati.htm'>MN 28</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">A similar theory attributes the irruption of mental states to the provocation of the properties of sensuality, form, or formlessness.</p>

					<p class="in4">"In dependence on the property of sensuality there occurs the perception of sensuality. In dependence on the perception of sensuality there occurs the resolve for sensuality... the desire for sensuality... the fever for sensuality... the quest for sensuality. Questing for sensuality, monks, an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person conducts himself wrongly through three means: through body, through speech, and through mind."<br />
					—SN 14.12</p>

					<p class="in4">Even unbinding is described as a property (<a href='../kd/iti/iti.2.than.ati.htm#p44'>Iti 44</a>). However, there is a crucial difference in how unbinding is attained, in that the unbinding property is not provoked. Any events that depend on the provocation of a property are inherently unstable and inconstant, subject to change when the provocation ends. But because true release is not caused by the provocation of anything, it is not subject to change.</p>
