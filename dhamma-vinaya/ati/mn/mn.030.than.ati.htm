					<p class="f4">Then Piṅgalakoccha the brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, these contemplatives and brahmans, each with his group, each with his community, each the teacher of his group, an honored leader, well-regarded by people at large — i.e., Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambalin, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta, and the Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do they all have direct knowledge as they themselves claim, or do they all not have direct knowledge, or do some of them have direct knowledge and some of them not?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Put this question aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will teach you the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir," Piṅgalakoccha the brahman responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Brahman, it's as if a man in need of heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood — passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood, passing over the sapwood, passing over the inner bark, passing over the outer bark — cutting away the twigs and leaves, were to go off carrying them, thinking, 'heartwood.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good eyesight, seeing him, would say, 'Ah, how this good man didn't know heartwood, didn't know sapwood, didn't know inner bark, didn't know outer bark, didn't know twigs and leaves!</p>

					<p class="f4">A man with good eyesight, seeing him, would say, 'Ah, how this good man <i>did</i> know heartwood, did know sapwood, did know inner bark, did know outer bark, did know twigs and leaves!</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, brahman, there is the case where a certain son of good family,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> out of conviction, goes forth from the home life into homelessness, (thinking,) 'I am beset by birth, by aging-and-death, by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs, beset by stress, overcome with stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps the end of this entire mass of stress might be discerned!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having thus gone forth, he encounters gain, offerings, and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is gratified with that gain, offerings, and fame, his resolve fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of that gain, offerings, and fame he exalts himself and disparages others:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a person with gain, offerings, and fame, but these other monks are unknown and of little influence.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't generate desire or exert himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher and more sublime than gain, offerings, and fame.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is drooping and lax.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the man who, in need of heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood — passing over the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood, passing over the sapwood, passing over the inner bark, passing over the outer bark — cutting away the twigs and leaves, went off carrying them, thinking, 'heartwood':</p>

					<p class="f4">He is gratified with that consummation in virtue, his resolve fulfilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because of that consummation in virtue he exalts himself and disparages others:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am a person of virtue, with fine qualities, but these other monks are unvirtuous, with evil qualities.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He generates desire and exerts himself for the realization of those qualities that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not drooping or lax.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which, brahman, are the qualities that are higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress — as with the earlier disappearance of joys and distresses — he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' he enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' he enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' he enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, he enters and remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, having seen (that) with discernment, his effluents are completely ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a quality higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the qualities higher and more sublime than knowledge and vision.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just like the man who, in need of heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, cutting away just the heartwood of a great standing tree possessed of heartwood, went off carrying it, knowing, 'heartwood':</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever heartwood-business he had with heartwood, his purpose will be served.</p>

					<p class="f4">This individual, I tell you, is similar to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, this holy life doesn't have as its reward gain, offerings, and fame, doesn't have as its reward consummation of virtue, doesn't have as its reward consummation of concentration, doesn't have as its reward knowledge and vision, but the unprovoked<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> awareness-release:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is the purpose of this holy life, that is its heartwood, that its final end."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Piṅgalakoccha the brahman said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Commentary explains that the first jhāna is listed as higher than knowledge and vision here because it is being presented in its role as a step toward cessation.
