					<p class="f4">For half a month, Sāriputta clearly saw insight<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> into mental qualities one after another.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what occurred to Sāriputta through insight into mental qualities one after another:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There was the case where Sāriputta —<br />
					quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures, withdrawn from unskillful qualities —<br />
					entered and remained in the first jhāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever qualities there are in the first jhāna —<br />
					directed thought, evaluation, rapture, pleasure, singleness of mind, contact, feeling, perception, intention, consciousness,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> desire, decision, persistence, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention —<br />
					he ferreted them out one after another.<br />
					Known to him they arose,<br />

					<p class="f4">He discerned, 'So this is how these qualities,<br />
					not having been, come into play.<br />
					Having been, they vanish.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He remained unattracted and unrepelled with regard to those qualities,<br />
					independent, detached, released,<br />
					dissociated,<br />
					with an awareness rid of barriers.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understood, 'There is a further escape,'<br />
					and pursuing it,<br />
					he confirmed that 'There is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation,<br />
					Sāriputta entered and remained in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of composure,<br />
					unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation —<br />
					internal assurance.<br />
					Whatever qualities there are in the second jhāna —<br />
					internal assurance, rapture, pleasure, singleness of mind, contact, feeling, perception, intention, consciousness, desire, decision, persistence, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention —<br />

					He understood, 'There is a further escape,'<br />
					and pursuing it,<br />
					he confirmed that 'There is.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the fading of rapture, Sāriputta —<br />
					remaining in equanimity,<br />
					mindful and alert,<br />
					and physically sensitive to pleasure —<br />
					entered and remained in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the noble ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasurable abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, with the abandoning of pleasure and stress —<br />

					and not heeding perceptions of diversity,<br />
					thinking, 'Infinite space,'<br />
					Sāriputta entered and remained in the dimension of the infinitude of space.<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Clearly saw insight": In Pali, this is<i> vipassanam vipassi,</i> which could be translated literally as "clearly saw clear seeing" or "insighted insight." The Commentary states that the half month mentioned here refers to the half month between Ven. Sāriputta's ordination and his attainment of arahantship, described in MN 74. (These two suttas treat Sāriputta's attainment from two different perspectives. This sutta shows it from the standpoint of his mastery of the four jhānas and the formless attainments based on the fourth jhāna. That sutta shows it as occurring when he starts reflecting on a point while listening to a discourse that the Buddha is giving to his nephew. To put the two suttas together, we can infer that prior to the discourse given in MN 74, Sāriputta had mastered the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception. While listening to the discourse, he reflected on the point that the Buddha recommended abandoning all mental qualities through direct knowledge. This would have led him to the cessation of perception and feeling (during which he would not be listening to the discourse) and so to Awakening.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Reading <i>viññanam </i>with the Thai edition of the Canon. The Burmese and PTS editions read <i>cittam,</i> which could mean "mind" or "intent" (as in the four bases of success).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Reading <i>passaddhattaa</i> with the Burmese edition. The Thai edition reads, <i>parisuddhattaa,</i> "through purity." The Sinhalese edition reads <i>pasiddhataa,</i> which would mean "empowerment" (? — this term is not listed in the PTS Dictionary). The PTS edition reads <i>passi vedanaa,</i> which is unintelligible.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Notice that, with each of the previous levels of attainment, Sāriputta was able to ferret out the various mental qualities arising there while he was still in the attainment. With this attainment and the following one, however, he was not able to analyze the mental qualities present and absent there until after he had left the attainment. The difference here is related to the point made in <a href="../an/09_nines/an09.036.than.ati.htm">AN IX.36</a> that all the attainments up through the dimension of nothingness are "perception-attainments." And that, "As far as the perception-attainments go, that is as far as gnosis-penetration goes. As for these two dimensions — the attainment of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception and the attainment of the cessation of feeling and perception — I tell you that they are to be rightly explained by those monks who are meditators, skilled in attaining, skilled in attaining and emerging, who have attained and emerged in dependence on them."</p>
