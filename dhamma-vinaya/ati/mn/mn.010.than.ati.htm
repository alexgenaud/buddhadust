					<h4>Introduction</h4>

					<p><i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i>  —  the establishing  <i>(upaṭṭhāna)</i> of mindfulness <i>(sati)</i>  —  is a meditative technique for training the mind to keep mindfulness firmly established in a particular frame of reference in all its activities.</p>

					<p>The term <i>sati</i> is related to the verb <i>sarati,</i> to remember or to keep in mind.</p>

					<p>It is sometimes translated as non-reactive awareness, free from agendas, simply present with whatever arises, but the formula for <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> doesn't support that translation.</p>

					<p>Non-reactive awareness is actually an aspect of equanimity, one of the mental qualities fostered in the course of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>.</p>

					<p>The activity of <i>satipaṭṭhāna,</i> however, definitely has a motivating agenda: the desire for awakening, which is classed not as a cause of suffering, but as part of the path to its ending (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_51_iddhipadasamyutta.htm#p15">SN 51:15</a>).</p>

					<p>The role of mindfulness is to keep the mind properly focused in frames of reference that will give it guidance in what present events to develop, and which ones to abandon, so as to keep it on the path.</p>

					<p>To make an analogy, awakening is like a mountain on the horizon, the destination to which you are driving a car.</p>

					<p>Mindfulness is what remembers to keep attention focused on the road to the mountain, rather than letting it stay focused on glimpses of the mountain or get distracted by other paths leading away from the road.</p>

					<p><i>Satipaṭṭhāna</i> plays a role in many formulations of the path to awakening.</p>

					<p>In the noble eightfold path, it is the seventh factor, following on right effort and leading to right concentration.</p>

					<p>In the five strengths and five faculties, it is the third factor, following on persistence and leading to concentration.</p>

					<p>In the seven factors for awakening, it is the first factor, providing a foundation for the remaining six factors: analysis of qualities, persistence, rapture, calm, concentration, and equanimity.</p>

					<p>The following sutta contains the longest treatment of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> found in the Canon.</p>

					<p>However, despite its length, its treatment of the topic is far from complete.</p>

					<p>This partly has to do with the nature of the topic itself.</p>

					<p>As the Buddha states in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">MN 12</a>:</p>

					      <p class="in2">"Sāriputta, suppose that I had four disciples with a 100-year life span, living for 100 years, and endowed with excellent mindfulness, retention, recall, and keenness of discernment.</p>

					<p>Just as an archer with a good bow  —  trained, dexterous, and practiced  —  could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palmyra tree, they  —  endowed with that great an extent of mindfulness, that great an extent of retention, that great an extent of recall, and that keenness of discernment  —  would ask me one question after another on the four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p>And I, asked again and again, would answer.</p>

					<p>Answered, they would remember what I had answered, and they wouldn't counter-question me about it a second time more.</p>

					<p>Aside from eating, drinking, chewing, and savoring, aside from urinating and defecating, aside from relieving sleepiness and weariness, there would be no ending of the <i>Tathāgata's</i> Dhamma teaching, there would be no ending of the <i>Tathāgata's</i> phrasing of Dhamma statements, there would be no ending of the <i>Tathāgata's</i> quick-wittedness (in answering) questions; but those four disciples of mine, with their 100-year life span, living for 100 years, would die with the passing of 100 years."</p>

					<p>Although the main thrust of this passage sense of compunctions the extent of the Buddha's knowledge, it also makes an important statement about how vast the topic of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is: Even with one hundred years of questioning, you couldn't exhaust it.</p>

					<p>The fact that <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22's</a> treatment of the <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is incomplete is also apparent from the organization of the sutta: The Buddha starts with a statement of the standard short formula for <i>satipaṭṭhāna:</i> "There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  —  ardent, alert, and mindful  —  subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p>He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in and of themselves  —  ardent, alert, and mindful  —  subduing greed and distress with reference to the world." However, the questions posed and answered in the course of the sutta explain and expand on only part of the formula: what it means to "remained focused" on each of the frames of reference in and of itself.</p>

					<p>Among other things, there is no discussion of how ardency functions in the practice, of what it means to subdue greed and distress with reference to the world, of how the various frames of reference interact in practice, nor of what the stages in the practice are.</p>

					<p>For this information, we have to look at other treatments of these topics found elsewhere in the Canon.</p>

					<p>For instance, <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118</a> makes the important point that focusing on the breath can bring all four frames of reference into play simultaneously.</p>

					<p>In other words, the body in and of itself is the main frame of reference, and the remaining three build on it.</p>

					<p><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p40">SN 47:40</a> mentions two stages in the practice  —  the establishing of mindfulness and the development of the establishing of mindfulness  —  adding that the second stage is accomplished by developing all eight factors of the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p>Among other things, this means that not only does the establishing of mindfulness provide a foundation for right concentration  —  the four <i>jhānas</i>  —  but the mastery of the four <i>jhānas</i> also helps to develop the establishing of mindfulness even further.</p>

					<p>When we compare <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p40">SN 47:40</a> with one of the refrains in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22,</a> we find three stages in <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice.</p>

					<p>The first stage, as applied to the body, is this:</p>

					      <p class="in2">The monk remains focused on the body in and of itself  —  ardent, alert, and mindful  —  subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p>The three qualities at the center of this formula are also central to the practice of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>.</p>

					<p> <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/02_nv/idx_16_kassapasamyutta.htm#p2">SN 16:2</a> shows that ardency is directly related to the practice of right effort.</p>

					<p>Thus mindfulness keeps the proper frame of reference in mind, alertness watches events related to that frame of reference, and these two qualities together give guidance to ardency so that it can, in line with right effort, abandon things that need to be abandoned, and to develop those that need to be developed.</p>

					<p>Although <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice is often said to be separate from the practice of <i>jhāna,</i> a number of suttas  —  such as <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p125">MN 125</a> and <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p6">AN 8:6</a>3  —  equate the successful completion of this first stage with the attainment of the first level of <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p>This point is confirmed by the many suttas  —  <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118</a> among them  —  describing how the practice of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> brings to completion the factors for awakening, which coincide with the factors of <i>jhāna</i>.</p>

					<p>The second stage of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice  —  the development of <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i>  —  is this:</p>

					      <p class="in2">One remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the body.</p>

					<p>The word "origination," here, does not mean that one is focused simply on the arising of phenomena.</p>

					<p>Instead, it means being focused on how phenomena arise in connection with causes.</p>

					<p>The "phenomenon of origination and passing away" covers events either directly or indirectly related to one's chosen frame of reference.</p>

					<p>"Directly" means changes in the frame of reference itself.</p>

					<p>For instance, when focused on the body, one may notice what causes breath sensations to arise and pass away within it.</p>

					<p>"Indirectly," here, means events in any of the other three frames of reference as they relate to the body.</p>

					<p>For example, one might notice what causes feelings of pleasure or mental states of irritation to arise and pass away in connection to events in the body.</p>

					<p>Or one might notice lapses of mindfulness in one's focus on the body.</p>

					<p>Of course, to see causal relations requires that the meditator consciously try to effect changes in events, to see which events actually have a causal relationship to one another and which ones don't.</p>

					<p>Here again, ardency in the practice of right effort and right concentration is what allows for this sort of understanding to arise.</p>

					<p>In every case, when skillful or unskillful qualities  —  such as the factors for awakening or the hindrances  —  arise and pass away, one is encouraged to foster the factors that strengthen <i>jhāna</i> and eliminate those that weaken it.</p>

					<p>This means actively getting engaged in maximizing skillful qualities and minimizing unskillful ones.</p>

					<p>One thus develops insight into the process of origination and passing away by taking an active and sensitive role in the process, just as you learn about eggs by trying to cook with them, gathering experience from your successes and failures in attempting increasingly difficult dishes.</p>

					<p>As this process leads to stronger and more refined states of concentration, it makes one sensitive to the fact that the grosser one's participation in the process of origination and passing away in the mind, the grosser the level of stress that results.</p>

					<p>This leads one to let go, first of grosser levels of participation, and then increasingly refined ones as one is able to detect them, leading to the third and final stage in <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> practice:</p>

					      <p class="in2">Or his mindfulness that 'There is a body' is maintained (simply) to the extent of knowledge and recollection.</p>

					<p>And he remains independent, unsustained by [not clinging to] anything in the world.</p>

					<p>This stage corresponds to a mode of perception that the Buddha in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p121">MN 121</a> terms "entry into emptiness":</p>

					      <p class="in2">Thus he regards it [this mode of perception] as empty of whatever is not there.</p>

					<p>Whatever remains, he discerns as present: "There is this."</p>

					<p>This is the culminating equipoise where the path of the practice opens to a state of non-fashioning (<i>atammayatā</i>  —  see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p137">MN 137</a>) and from there to the fruit of awakening and release.</p>

					<p>These few examples show how important it is, in reading this sutta, to remember that its treatment of <i>satipaṭṭhāna,</i> though extensive, is incomplete and needs to be understood in terms of the larger context of teachings provided by the Canon on all the other factors of the path.</p>

					<p>The notes to this sutta provide some beginning guidance in where to look for this further information, as do the recommended sutta readings listed at the end.</p>

					<p class="notetitle">Note on the translation</p>

					<p>This translation is based on the Thai edition of the sutta, which is identical with its version of <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p22">DN 22</a>.</p>

					<p>Other editions of the Canon omit the long section explaining the four noble truths, which is here contained in double braces, like this:  {{  }}.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Ekāyana-magga.</i> For decades, this term was translated as "the only way," but more recently — beginning with Ven. Ñāṇamoli — translators have noted that the phrase <i>ekāyana magga</i> appears in a series of similes in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">MN 12</a> where it reveals its idiomatic sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In each of the similes, the Buddha describes his knowledge of the destination of an individual on a particular path of practice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">He sees that the way the individual conducts himself will lead inevitably to a particular destination.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">He then compares his knowledge to that of a person seeing an individual following an <i>ekāyana magga</i> to a particular destination and knowing that the individual will have to end up there for sure.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p><i>Ekāyana magga.</i> It could fit just as well using 'the one direct way', or 'the one sure way'.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt">For the similes to work, <i>ekāyana magga</i> requires the sense, not of an only way, but of a way that goes to only one destination.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">In other words, an <i>ekāyana magga</i> is a path that doesn't fork — one that, as long as you follow it, takes you to a single, inevitable goal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Of the similes in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">MN 12,</a> one deals with an <i>ekāyana magga</i> to unbinding — which, of course, would apply to the practice of right mindfulness:</p>

					      <p class="lgqt in2">"Suppose that there were a lotus pond with pristine water, pleasing water, cool water, pellucid water; with restful banks, refreshing; and not far from it was a dense forest grove.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">A man — scorched with heat, overcome by heat, exhausted, trembling, and thirsty — would come along a path going one way only <i>[ekāyana magga]</i> directed to that lotus pond.</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">A man with good eyes, on seeing him, would say, 'The way this individual has practiced, the way he conducts himself, and the path he has entered are such that he will come to that lotus pond.' Then at a later time he would see him — having plunged into the lotus pond, having bathed and drunk and relieved all his disturbance, exhaustion, and fever, and having come back out — sitting or lying down in the forest grove, experiencing feelings that are exclusively pleasant.</p>

              			<p class="lgqt in2">"In the same way, Sāriputta, there is the case where — having thus encompassed awareness with awareness — I know of a certain individual: 'The way this individual has practiced, the way he conducts himself, and the path he has entered are such that he will, through the ending of the effluents, enter and remain in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here and now.'

							<p><i>Parimukhaṃ.</i> Words have been known to have more than one meaning. This term is used about 50/50 in PED for 'face' and 'mouth' (think 'face of the moon', 'mug', and 'mouth of the river') and it also does mean 'front' and 'interface'.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> To the fore <i>(parimukhaṃ):</i> The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach to this term, defining it as around <i>(pari-)</i> the mouth <i>(mukhaṃ).</i> In the Vinaya, however, it is used in a context (Cv.V.27.4) where it undoubtedly means the front of the chest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically as "to the front," which is how I have translated it here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> The commentaries insist that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this context, for the next step — without further explanation — refers to the breath as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms to refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful to signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does below, when explaining that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice of focusing on the body in and of itself as a frame of reference).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The step of breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to the many similes in the suttas depicting <i>jhāna</i> as a state of whole-body awareness (see <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p2">DN 2</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> "In-and-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied up with the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Similarly, the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling not of the flesh is equivalent to the feeling of equanimity not of the flesh experienced in the fourth <i>jhāna</i> (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_48_indriyasamyutta.htm#p38">SN 48:38</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Feelings of this sort don't simply come on their own.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">They're a product of fabrication.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">They have to be induced.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">And as the standard similes for the practice of <i>jhāna</i> show, the feelings of pleasure not of the flesh experienced in the first three <i>jhānas</i> aren't simply induced; they're spread and suffused until they permeate and fill the entire body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">"Painful feeling not of the flesh" is nowhere defined in the Canon, but we can derive from the discourses two possible ways of understanding it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On the one hand, it could be the sense of mental displeasure experienced while engaging in the contemplation of the unattractiveness of the body or the perception of death, which are painful ways to awakening (<a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p163">AN 4:163</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On the other hand, a passage from <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">MN 44</a> suggests that a painful feeling not of the flesh would be the distress that accompanies this thought: "O when will I enter and remain in the dimension that the noble ones now enter and remain in?" In other words, it's the feeling of distress you experience when contemplating how much you want to attain the goal and you haven't yet attained it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Another example of this sort of distress would be the reflection given in <a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p28">MN 28</a>: "It is a loss for me, not a gain; ill-gotten for me, not well-gotten, that when I recollect the Buddha, Dhamma, and Sa?gha in this way, equanimity based on what is skillful is not established within me."</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">"And how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind?</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">Imagine a young woman — or man — youthful, fond of adornment, examining the image of her own face in a bright, clean mirror or bowl of clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would try to remove it.</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be pleased, her resolves fulfilled: 'How fortunate I am! How clean I am!' In the same way, a monk's self-examination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities [if he conducts it in this way]: 'Do I usually remain covetous or not? With thoughts of ill will or not? Overcome by sloth and drowsiness or not? Restless or not? Uncertain or gone beyond uncertainty? Angry or not? With soiled thoughts or unsoiled thoughts? With my body aroused or unaroused? Lazy or with persistence aroused? Unconcentrated or concentrated?'</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">"If, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain covetous, with thoughts of ill will, overcome by sloth and drowsiness, restless, uncertain, angry, with soiled thoughts, with my body aroused, lazy, or unconcentrated,' then he should put forth intense desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, and alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, unskillful qualities.</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">Just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth intense desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, and alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head; in the same way, the monk should put forth intense desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, and alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, unskillful qualities.</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2">"But if, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain uncovetous, without thoughts of ill will, free of sloth and drowsiness, not restless, gone beyond uncertainty, not angry, with unsoiled thoughts, with my body unaroused, with persistence aroused, and concentrated,' then his duty is to make an effort in establishing ['tuning'] those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents."  —  <i><a href="../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p51">AN 10:51</a></i></p>
