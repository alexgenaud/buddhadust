					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the forest-hinterland sequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there is the case where a monk lives in dependence on a certain forest hinterland.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is living in dependence on that forest hinterland, his unestablished mindfulness doesn't become established, his unconcentrated mind doesn't become concentrated, his unended effluents don't come to an end, the unattained safety from the yoke isn't attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the requisites of life that should be obtained by one gone forth — robes, almsfood, lodging, or medicinal requisites used for curing the sick — are obtained with difficulty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He should reflect on that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I live in dependence on this forest hinterland.</p>
