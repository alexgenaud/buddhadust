					<p class="f4">Then <a id="kotthita">Ven. Maha Kotthita</a>,<br />
					arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon,<br />
					went to <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.<br />
					After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<h4><a id="discernment">Discernment</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sāriputta,<br />
					"Friend, 'One of poor discernment, one of poor discernment':<br />
					Thus is it said.<br />
					To what extent is one said to be<br />
					'one of poor discernment'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'One doesn't discern, one doesn't discern':<br />
					Thus, friend, one is said to be<br />

					One doesn't discern, 'This is stress.'<br />
					One doesn't discern, 'This is the origination of stress.'<br />
					One doesn't discern, 'This is the cessation of stress.'<br />
					One doesn't discern, 'This is the practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'One doesn't discern, one doesn't discern':<br />
					Thus one is said to be<br />
					'one of poor discernment.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Saying, "Very good, friend,"<br />
					Ven. Maha Kotthita — delighting in and approving of Ven. Sāriputta's statement &mdash;<br />
					asked him a further question:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Discerning, discerning':<br />
					Thus is it said.<br />
					To what extent, friend,<br />
					is one said to be 'discerning'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'One discerns, one discerns':<br />
					Thus, friend, one is said to be 'discerning.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what does one discern?<br />
					One discerns, 'This is stress.'<br />

					<h4><a id="consciousness">Consciousness</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"'Consciousness, consciousness':<br />
					Thus is it said.<br />
					To what extent, friend,<br />
					is it said to be 'consciousness'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It cognizes, it cognizes':<br />
					Thus, friend, it is said to be 'consciousness.'</p>

					It cognizes 'pleasant.'<br />
					It cognizes 'painful.'<br />
					It cognizes 'neither painful nor pleasant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It cognizes, it cognizes':<br />
					Thus it is said to be 'consciousness.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Discernment and consciousness, friend:<br />
					Are these qualities conjoined or disjoined?<br />
					Is it possible,<br />
					having separated them one from the other,<br />
					to delineate the difference between them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Discernment and consciousness are conjoined, friend, not disjoined.<br />
					It's not possible,<br />
					having separated them one from the other,<br />
					to delineate the difference between them.<br />
					For what one discerns,<br />
					that one cognizes.<br />
					What one cognizes,<br />
					that one discerns.<br />
					Therefore these qualities are conjoined, not disjoined,<br />
					and it is not possible,<br />
					having separated them one from another,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Discernment and consciousness, friend:<br />

					<p class="f4">"Discernment and consciousness, friend:<br />

					is it said to be 'feeling'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It feels, it feels':<br />

					It feels pleasure.<br />
					It feels pain.<br />
					It feels neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It feels, it feels':<br />
					Thus it is said to be 'feeling.'"</p>

					<h4><a id="perception">Perception</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"'Perception, perception':<br />
					Thus is it said.<br />
					To what extent, friend,<br />
					is it said to be 'perception'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It perceives, it perceives':<br />
					Thus, friend, it is said to be 'perception.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And what does it perceive?<br />
					It perceives blue.<br />
					It perceives yellow.<br />
					It perceives red.<br />
					It perceives white.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It perceives, it perceives':<br />
					Thus it is said to be 'perception.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling, perception, and consciousness, friend:<br />
					Are these qualities conjoined or disjoined?<br />
					Is it possible,<br />
					having separated them one from another,<br />
					to delineate the difference among them?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling, perception, and consciousness<br />
					are conjoined, friend, not disjoined.<br />
					It is not possible,<br />
					having separated them one from another,<br />
					to delineate the difference among them.<br />
					For what one feels, that one perceives.<br />
					What one perceives, that one cognizes.<br />
					Therefore these qualities are conjoined, not disjoined,<br />
					and it is not possible,<br />
					having separated them one from another,<br />
					to delineate the difference among them."</p>

					<h4><a id="eye">The eye of discernment</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, what can be known<br />
					with the purified intellect-consciousness<br />
					divorced from the five [sense] faculties?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, with the purified intellect-consciousness<br />
					divorced from the five faculties<br />
					the dimension of the infinitude of space<br />
					can be known [as] 'infinite space.'<br />
					The dimension of the infinitude of consciousness<br />
					can be known [as] 'infinite consciousness.'<br />
					The dimension of nothingness<br />
					can be known [as] 'There is nothing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"With what does one know<br />
					a quality that can be known?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"One knows a quality that can be known<br />
					with the eye of discernment."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of discernment?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The purpose of discernment is direct knowledge,<br />
					its purpose is full comprehension,<br />
					its purpose is abandoning."</p>

					<h4><a id="view">Right view</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, how many conditions are there<br />
					for the arising of right view?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, there are two conditions<br />
					for the arising of right view:<br />
					the voice of another and appropriate attention.<br />
					These are the two conditions<br />
					for the arising of right view."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And assisted by how many factors<br />
					does right view have awareness-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward,<br />
					and discernment-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Assisted by five factors,<br />
					right view has awareness-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward,<br />
					and discernment-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where right view is assisted by virtue,<br />
					assisted by learning,<br />
					assisted by discussion,<br />
					assisted by tranquility,<br />
					assisted by insight.<br />
					Assisted by these five factors,<br />
					right view has awareness-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward,<br />
					and discernment-release<br />
					as its fruit and reward."</p>

					<h4><a id="becoming">Becoming</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, how many kinds of becoming are there?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, there are these three kinds of becoming:<br />
					sensual becoming,<br />
					form becoming,<br />
					formless becoming."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is further becoming in the future<br />
					brought about?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The delight, now here, now there,<br />
					of beings hindered by ignorance<br />
					and fettered by craving:<br />
					That's how further becoming in the future<br />
					is brought about."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is further becoming in the future<br />
					not brought about?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Through the fading of ignorance,<br />
					the arising of clear knowing,<br />
					and the cessation of craving:<br />
					That's how further becoming in the future<br />
					is not brought about."</p>

					<h4><a id="jhāna1">The first jhāna</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"What, friend, is the first jhāna?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, friend, where a monk<br />
					&mdash; quite withdrawn from sensual pleasures,<br />
					withdrawn from unskillful qualities &mdash;<br />
					enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born from withdrawal,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.<br />
					This is called the first jhāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how many factors does the first jhāna have?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The first jhāna has five factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where,<br />
					in a monk who has attained the five-factored first jhāna,<br />
					there occurs directed thought,<br />
					evaluation,<br />
					rapture,<br />
					pleasure,<br />
					and singleness of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's in this way<br />
					that the first jhāna has five factors."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how many factors are abandoned in the first jhāna,<br />
					and with how many is it endowed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Five factors are abandoned in the first jhāna,<br />
					and with five is it endowed.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where,<br />
					in a monk who has attained the first jhāna,<br />
					sensual desire is abandoned,<br />
					ill will is abandoned,<br />
					sloth and torpor is abandoned,<br />
					restlessness and anxiety is abandoned,<br />
					uncertainty is abandoned.<br />
					And there occur directed thought,<br />
					evaluation,<br />
					rapture,<br />
					pleasure,<br />
					and singleness of mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's in this way that five factors are abandoned in the first jhāna,<br />
					and with five it is endowed."</p>

					<h4><a id="faculties">The five faculties</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, there are these five faculties<br />
					each with a separate range,<br />
					a separate domain,<br />
					and they do not experience<br />
					one another's range and domain:<br />
					the eye-faculty,<br />
					the ear-faculty,<br />
					the nose-faculty,<br />
					the tongue-faculty,<br />
					and the body-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what do these five faculties<br />
					&mdash; each with a separate range,<br />
					a separate domain,<br />
					not experiencing one another's range and domain:<br />
					the eye-faculty,<br />
					the ear-faculty,<br />
					the nose-faculty,<br />
					the tongue-faculty,<br />
					and the body-faculty &mdash;<br />
					have as their [common] arbitrator?<br />
					What experiences [all] their ranges and domains?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, these five faculties<br />
					&mdash; each with a separate range,<br />
					a separate domain,<br />
					not experiencing one another's range and domain:<br />
					the eye-faculty,<br />
					the ear-faculty,<br />
					the nose-faculty,<br />
					the tongue-faculty,<br />
					and the body-faculty &mdash;<br />
					have the intellect as their [common] arbitrator.<br />
					The intellect is what experiences [all] their ranges and domains."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, these five faculties<br />
					&mdash; the eye-faculty,<br />
					the ear-faculty,<br />
					the nose-faculty,<br />
					the tongue-faculty,<br />
					and the body-faculty:<br />
					In dependence on what<br />
					do they remain standing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"These five faculties<br />
					&mdash; the eye-faculty,<br />
					the ear-faculty,<br />
					the nose-faculty,<br />
					the tongue-faculty,<br />
					and the body-faculty &mdash;<br />
					remain standing in dependence on vitality."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And vitality remains standing<br />
					in dependence on what?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vitality remains standing<br />
					in dependence on heat."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And heat remains standing<br />
					in dependence on what?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Heat remains standing<br />
					in dependence on vitality."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, friend Sāriputta, we understood you to say,<br />
					'Vitality remains standing in dependence on heat.'<br />
					And just now we understood you to say,<br />
					'Heat remains standing in dependence on vitality.'<br />
					Now how is the meaning of these statements to be seen?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, friend,<br />
					I will give you analogy,<br />
					for there are cases where it is through an analogy<br />
					that an intelligent person understands the meaning of a statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose an oil lamp is burning.<br />
					Its radiance is discerned<br />
					in dependence on its flame,<br />
					and its flame is discerned<br />
					in dependence on its radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					vitality remains standing<br />
					in dependence on heat,<br />
					and heat remains standing<br />
					in dependence on vitality.</p>

					<h4><a id="vitality">Vitality-fabrications</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, are vitality-fabrications<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
					the same thing as feeling-states?<br />
					Or are vitality-fabrications one thing,<br />
					and feeling-states another?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vitality-fabrications are not the same thing<br />
					as feeling-states, friend.<br />
					If vitality-fabrications were the same thing<br />
					as feeling-states,<br />
					the emergence of a monk<br />
					from the attainment of the cessation of feeling and perception<br />
					would not be discerned.<br />
					It's because vitality-fabrications are one thing<br />
					and feeling-states another<br />
					that the emergence of a monk<br />
					from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling<br />
					is discerned."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this body lacks how many qualities<br />
					does it lie discarded and forsaken,<br />
					like a senseless log?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this body lacks these three qualities<br />
					&mdash; vitality, heat, and consciousness &mdash;<br />
					it lies discarded and forsaken<br />
					like a senseless log."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the difference between one who is dead,<br />
					who has completed his time,<br />
					and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the case of the one who is dead,<br />
					who has completed his time,<br />
					his bodily fabrications have ceased and subsided,<br />
					his verbal fabrications ...<br />
					his mental fabrications have ceased and subsided,<br />
					his vitality is exhausted,<br />
					his heat subsided,<br />
					and his faculties are scattered.<br />
					But in the case of a monk<br />
					who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling,<br />
					his bodily fabrications have ceased and subsided,<br />
					his verbal fabrications ...<br />
					his mental fabrications have ceased and subsided,<br />
					his vitality is not exhausted,<br />
					his heat has not subsided,<br />
					and his faculties are exceptionally clear.<br />
					This is the difference between one who is dead,<br />
					who has completed his time,<br />
					and a monk who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling."</p>

					<h4><a id="awareness">Awareness-release</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, how many conditions are there for the attainment<br />
					of the neither-pleasant-nor-painful awareness-release?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, there are four conditions for the attainment<br />
					of the neither-pleasant-nor-painful awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />
					with the abandoning of pleasure and stress<br />
					&mdash; as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress &mdash;<br />
					enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the four conditions for the attainment<br />
					of the neither-pleasant-nor-painful awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"How many conditions are there for the attainment<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are two conditions for the attainment<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release:<br />
					lack of attention to all themes<br />
					and attention to the theme-less property.<br />
					These are the two conditions for the attainment<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how many conditions are there for the persistence<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are three conditions for the persistence<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release:<br />
					lack of attention to all themes,<br />
					attention to the theme-less property,<br />
					and a prior act of will.<br />
					These are the three conditions for the persistence<br />
					of the theme-less awareness-release."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how many conditions are there<br />
					for the emergence from<br />
					the theme-less awareness-release?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are two conditions<br />
					for the emergence from<br />
					the theme-less awareness-release:<br />
					attention to all themes<br />
					and lack of attention to the theme-less property.<br />
					These are the two conditions<br />
					for the emergence from<br />
					the theme-less awareness-release."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The limitless awareness-release,<br />
					the nothingness awareness-release,<br />
					the emptiness awareness-release,<br />
					the theme-less-awareness-release:<br />

					or are they one in meaning<br />
					and different only in name?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The limitless awareness-release,<br />

					<p class="f4">"And what is the way of explanation<br />
					by which these qualities<br />
					are different in meaning<br />
					and different in name?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where a monk keeps pervading the first direction<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
					&mdash; as well as the second direction,<br />
					the third, and the fourth &mdash;<br />
					with an awareness imbued with good will.<br />
					Thus he keeps pervading above, below,<br />

					the all-encompassing world<br />

					abundant, expansive, limitless,<br />
					free from hostility,<br />

					free from ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is called the limitless awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the nothingness awareness-release?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />

					This is called the nothingness awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the emptiness awareness-release?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />
