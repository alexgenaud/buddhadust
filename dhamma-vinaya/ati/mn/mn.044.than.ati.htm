					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p>The Buddha praised Dhammadinna the nun as the foremost Dhamma teacher among his nun disciples. In this discourse she answers questions put to her by a layman — Visakha — who, according to the commentary, was her former husband, a merchant of Rājagaha, and a non-returner.</p>

					Then <a id="visakha">Visakha</a> the lay follower went to <a id="dhammadinna">Dhammadinna</a> the nun and, on arrival, having bowed down to her, sat to one side.<br />

					<p class="f4">"There are these five clinging-aggregates, friend Visakha:<br />

					<p class="f4">Saying, "Yes, lady," Visakha the lay follower delighted and rejoiced in what Dhammadinna the nun had said.<br />

					<p class="f4">This, friend Visakha, is the origination of self-identification described by the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The remainderless fading and cessation,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Friend Visakha, neither is clinging the same thing as the five clinging-aggregates,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Verbal fabrication grows still on attaining the second jhāna; bodily fabrication grows still on attaining the fourth jhāna; mental fabrication grows still on attaining the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Emptiness, the signless, and the undirected are names for a state of concentration that lies on the threshould of Unbinding. They differ only in how they are approached. According to the commentary, they color one's first apprehension of Unbinding: a meditator who has been focusing on the theme of inconstancy will first apprehend Unbinding as signless; one who has been focusing on the theme of stress will first apprehend it as undirected; one who has been focusing on the theme of not-self will first apprehend it as emptiness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> According to the commentary, "seclusion" here stands for Unbinding. On emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling, and having had contact with emptiness/the signless/the undirected, the mind inclines naturally to a direct experience of Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> In other words, once the pleasure of the first jhāna has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to arahantship, the mind has no further passion-obsession with pleasant feeling. (The commentary says that this is true at attainment of non-returning, but this must be a mistake, as non-returners are still subject to passion for form and formless phenomena.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Once this sorrow has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to non-returning, the mind has no further resistance-obsession with painful feeling.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Once this feeling of neither pleasure nor pain has been used as a basis for giving rise to the discernment that leads to arahantship, the mind has no further ignorance-obsession with feelings of neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This reading follows the Thai edition of the Pali Canon. The PTS edition of the Pali Canon gives the first two questions and answers in this exchange as follows:</p>

					<p class="in3">"Now what, lady, lies on the other side of pleasant feeling?"<br />
					"Painful feeling lies on the other side of pleasant feeling."<br />
					"And what lies on the other side of painful feeling?"<br />
					"Pleasant feeling lies on the other side of painful feeling."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">For some reason, the editors of neither edition seem to have been aware of the reading in the other edition.</p>
