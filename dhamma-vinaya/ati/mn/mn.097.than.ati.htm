					<p class="f4">Now, on that occasion Ven. Sāriputta was wandering in the Southern Mountains with a large community of monks. Then a certain monk who had spent the Rains in Rājagaha went to the Southern Mountains, to Ven. Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven. Sāriputta and — after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies — sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Sāriputta said to him, "I trust, friend, that the Blessed One is strong and free from illness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Blessed One, friend, is strong and free from illness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I trust that the community of monks is strong and free from illness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The community of monks is also strong and free from illness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"At the Tandulapala Gate is a brahman named Dhanañjani.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">I trust that he is strong and free from illness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhanañjani the brahman is also strong and free from illness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And I trust that Dhanañjani the brahman is heedful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"From where would our Dhanañjani the brahman get any heedfulness, friend?</p>

					<p class="f4">Relying on the king, he plunders brahmans and householders.</p>

					<p class="f4">Relying on the brahmans and householders, he plunders the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">His wife — a woman of faith, fetched from a family with faith — has died.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has fetched another wife — a woman of no faith — from a family with no faith."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What a bad thing to hear, my friend — when we hear that Dhanañjani the brahman is heedless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps sooner or later we might meet with Dhanañjani the brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perhaps there might be some conversation."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, having stayed in the Southern Mountains as long as he liked, wandered in the direction of Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">After wandering by stages, he arrived at Rājagaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he stayed near Rājagaha in the Squirrels' Sanctuary.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning, Ven. Sāriputta put on his robes and, carrying his bowl and outer robe, went into Rājagaha for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Dhanañjani the brahman was milking cows in a cow pen outside the city.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, having gone for alms in Rājagaha, after his meal, on his way back from his almsround, went to Dhanañjani the brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dhanañjani the brahman saw Ven. Sāriputta coming from afar.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him, he went to him and said, "Drink some of this fresh milk, master Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">It must be time for your meal."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's all right, brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have finished my meal for today.</p>

					<p class="f4">My day's abiding will be under that tree over there.</p>

					<p class="f4">You may come there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, master," Dhanañjani responded to Ven. Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then after he had finished his morning meal, he went to Ven. Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with Ven. Sāriputta and — after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies — sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Sāriputta said to him, "I trust, Dhanañjani, that you are heedful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"From where would we get any heedfulness, master? — when parents are to be supported, wife and children are to be supported, slaves and workers are to be supported, friend-&amp;-companion duties are to be done for friends and companions, kinsmen-&amp;-relative duties for kinsmen and relatives, guest duties for guests, departed-ancestor duties for departed ancestors, devatā duties for devatās, king duties for the king, and this body also has to be refreshed and nourished."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a certain person, for the sake of his mother and father, does what is unrighteous, does what is discordant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, because of his unrighteous, discordant behavior, hell-wardens drag him off to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he gain anything by saying, 'I did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for the sake of my mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] me into hell, hell-wardens!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would his mother and father gain anything for him by saying, 'He did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for our sake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] him into hell, hell-wardens!'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, master Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even right while he was wailing, they'd cast him into hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a certain person, for the sake of his wife and children ... his slaves and workers ... his friends and companions ... his kinsmen and relatives ... his guests ... his departed ancestors ... the devatās ... the king, does what is unrighteous, does what is discordant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, because of his unrighteous, discordant behavior, hell-wardens drag him off to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he gain anything by saying, 'I did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for the sake of the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] me into hell, hell-wardens!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would the king gain anything for him by saying, 'He did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for our sake.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] him into hell, hell-wardens!'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, master Sāriputta. Even right while he was wailing, they'd cast him into hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a certain person, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing his body, does what is unrighteous, does what is discordant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, because of his unrighteous, discordant behavior, hell-wardens drag him off to hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he gain anything by saying, 'I did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing my body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] me into hell, hell-wardens!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or would others gain anything for him by saying, 'He did what is unrighteous, what is discordant, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't [throw] him into hell, hell-wardens!'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, master Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even right while he was wailing, they'd cast him into hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what do you think, Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the better: one who, for the sake of his mother and father, would do what is unrighteous, what is discordant; or one who, for the sake of his mother and father, would do what is righteous, what is concordant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Sāriputta, the one who, for the sake of his mother and father, would do what is unrighteous, what is discordant, is not the better one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one who, for the sake of his mother and father, would do what is righteous, what is concordant would be the better one there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Righteous behavior, concordant behavior, is better than unrighteous behavior, discordant behavior.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhanañjani, there are other activities — reasonable, righteous — by which one can support one's mother and father, and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is the better: one who, for the sake of his wife and children ... his slaves and workers ... his friends and companions ... his kinsmen and relatives ... his guests ... his departed ancestors ... the devatās ... the king ... refreshing and nourishing his body, would do what is unrighteous, what is discordant; or one who, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing his body, would do what is righteous, what is concordant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Sāriputta, the one who, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing his body, would do what is unrighteous, what is discordant, is not the better one.</p>

					<p class="f4">The one who, for the sake of refreshing and nourishing his body, would do what is righteous, what is concordant would be the better one there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Righteous behavior, concordant behavior, is better than unrighteous behavior, discordant behavior.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhanañjani, there are other activities — reasonable, righteous — by which one can refresh and nourish one's body, and at the same time both not do evil and practice the practice of merit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Dhanañjani the brahman, delighting and rejoicing in Ven. Sāriputta's words, got up from his seat and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then on a later occasion, Dhanañjani the brahman became diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he said to one of his men,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, my good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then go to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to Ven. Sāriputta's feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would be good if Ven. Sāriputta would visit Dhanañjani's home, out of sympathy for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, lord," to Dhanañjani the brahman, the man went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Venerable sir, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to Ven. Sāriputta's feet."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be good if Ven. Sāriputta would visit Dhanañjani's home, out of sympathy for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta acquiesced through silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, having put on his robes and, taking his bowl and outer robe, went to Dhanañjani's home.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat and said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">"I trust you are getting better, Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">I trust you are comfortable?</p>

					<p class="f4">I trust that your pains are lessening and not increasing?</p>

					<p class="f4">I trust that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not getting better, Master Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My severe pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Extreme forces slice through my head, just as if a strong man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword ....</p>

					<p class="f4">Extreme pains have arisen in my head, just as if a strong man were tightening a turban on my head with a tough leather strap ....</p>

					<p class="f4">Extreme forces carve up my stomach cavity, just as if an expert butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach cavity of an ox with a sharp butcher's knife ....</p>

					<p class="f4">There is an extreme burning in my body, just as if two strong men, seizing a weaker man with their arms, were to roast and broil him over a pit of hot embers.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not getting better, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My severe pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Dhanañjani?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is better: hell or the animal womb?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The animal womb is better than hell, Master Sāriputta."</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Which is better: the animal womb or the realm of the hungry shades?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"... the realm of the hungry shades ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"... the realm of the hungry shades or human beings?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"... human beings ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...human beings or the Four Great King devas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Four Great King devas ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Four Great King devas or the devas of the Thirty-three?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the devas of the Thirty-three ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the devas of the Thirty-three or the Yama devas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Yama devas ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Yama devas or the Tusita devas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Tusita devas ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Tusita devas or the Nimmanarati devas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Nimmanarati devas ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Nimmanarati devas or the Paranimmitavasavatti devas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Paranimmitavasavatti devas ...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"...the Paranimmitavasavatti devas or the Brahma world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Did Master Sāriputta say, 'Brahma world'?</p>

					<p class="f4">Did Master Sāriputta say, 'Brahma world'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to Ven. Sāriputta,</p>

					<p class="f4">"These brahmans are set on the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach Dhanañjani the brahman the path to union with the Brahmas?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[So he said:]</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dhanañjani, I will teach you the path to union with the Brahmas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay careful attention to that.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, master," Dhanañjani the brahman responded to Ven. Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the path to union with the Brahmas?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with good will, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with good will — abundant, expansive, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion ... appreciation ... equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity — abundant, expansive, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Dhanañjani, is the path to union with the Brahmas."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Master Sāriputta, pay homage to the Blessed One's feet with your head in my name and say</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So Ven. Sāriputta — when there was still more to be done, having established Dhanañjani the brahman in the inferior<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> Brahma world — got up from his seat and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after Ven. Sāriputta's departure, Dhanañjani the brahman died and reappeared in the Brahma world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One said to the monks,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, Sāriputta — when there was still more to be done, having established Dhanañjani the brahman in the inferior Brahma world — has gotten up from his seat and left."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Dhanañjani the brahman is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why, Sāriputta — when there was still more to be done, having established Dhanañjani the brahman in the inferior Brahma world — did you get up from your seat and leave?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The thought occurred to me, lord,</p>

					<p class="f4">'These brahmans are set on the Brahma worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach Dhanañjani the brahman the path to union with the Brahmas?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, Dhanañjani the brahman has died and reappeared in the Brahma world."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The PTS edition of the canon gives this name as Dhaanañjaani, whereas the Thai and Sri Lankan editions give it as Dhanañjaani. This discourse is unusual in that Ven. Sāriputta addresses Dhanañjani not as "householder," but by his personal name. This would seem to indicate that the two of them were on especially familiar terms.</p>
