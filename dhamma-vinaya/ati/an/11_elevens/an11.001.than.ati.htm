<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Elevens, Sutta 1. Ānanda asks about the point and the profit, and the Buddha explains that good conduct has freedom from remorse as object and profit; freedom from remorse has joy; joy has rapture; rapture has calm; calm has happiness; happiness has concentration; concentration has seeing things as they really are; seeing things as they really are has revulsion; revulsion has fading interest; and fading of interest has release by knowing and seeing as their object and profit." />

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the purpose of skillful virtues?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is their reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose, Ānanda, and freedom from remorse as their reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of freedom from remorse?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Freedom from remorse has joy as its purpose, joy as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of joy?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Joy has rapture as its purpose, rapture as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of rapture?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rapture has calm as its purpose, calm as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of calm?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calm has pleasure as its purpose, pleasure as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of pleasure?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Pleasure has concentration as its purpose, concentration as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Concentration has knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be as its purpose, knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be has disenchantment as its purpose, disenchantment as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of disenchantment?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose, dispassion as its reward."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the purpose of dispassion?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is its reward?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dispassion has knowledge and vision of release as its purpose, knowledge and vision of release as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus in this way, Ānanda, skillful virtues have freedom from remorse as their purpose, freedom from remorse as their reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Freedom from remorse has joy as its purpose, joy as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Joy has rapture as its purpose, rapture as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Rapture has calm as its purpose, calm as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Calm has pleasure as its purpose, pleasure as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasure has concentration as its purpose, concentration as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Concentration has knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be as its purpose, knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge and vision of things as they have come to be has disenchantment as its purpose, disenchantment as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchantment has dispassion as its purpose, dispassion as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dispassion has knowledge and vision of release as its purpose, knowledge and vision of release as its reward.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this way, Ānanda, skillful virtues lead step-by-step to the consummation of arahantship."</p>
