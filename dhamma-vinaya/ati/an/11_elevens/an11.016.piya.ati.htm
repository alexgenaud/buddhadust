					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Sāvatthi at Jetavana at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he addressed the monks saying, "Monks." —  "Venerable Sir," said the monks, by way of reply.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, eleven advantages are to be expected from the release (deliverance) of heart by familiarizing oneself with thoughts of loving-kindness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, by the cultivation of loving-kindness, by constantly increasing these thoughts, by regarding loving-kindness as a vehicle (of expression), and also as something to be treasured, by living in conformity with these thoughts, by putting these ideas into practice, and by establishing them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What are the eleven?</p>

					<p class="f4">"He sleeps in comfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He awakes in comfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He sees no evil dreams.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is dear to human beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is dear to non-human beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Devas (gods) protect him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fire, poison, and sword cannot touch him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His mind can concentrate quickly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His countenance is serene.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He dies without being confused in mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he fails to attain Arahantship<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>,<br />
					he will be reborn in the brahma-world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These eleven advantages, monks, are to be expected from the release of heart by familiarizing oneself with thoughts of loving-kindness, by cultivation of loving-kindness, by constantly increasing these thoughts, by regarding loving-kindness as a vehicle (of expression), and also as something to be treasured, by living in conformity with these thoughts, by putting these ideas into practice and by establishing them."</p>

					<p class="f4">So said the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.</p>
