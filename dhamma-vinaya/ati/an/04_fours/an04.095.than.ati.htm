<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 95. The Buddha ranks four persons according to their pursuit of personal profit and the profit of others. The one who pursues neither his own profit nor the profit of others is likened to a stick burning at both ends, smeared with dung in the middle: no good for nuth'n. The one who pursues both his own profit and the profit of others is likened to 'the cream of the cream.'" />
