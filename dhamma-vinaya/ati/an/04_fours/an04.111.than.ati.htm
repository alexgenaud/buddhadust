					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"You, Kesi, are a trained man,<br />
					a trainer of tamable horses.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how do you train a tamable horse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, I train a tamable horse<br />
					[sometimes] with mildness,<br />
					[sometimes] with harshness,<br />
					[sometimes] with both mildness and harshness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if a tamable horse does not submit<br />
					either to a mild training<br />
					or to a harsh training<br />
					or to a mild and harsh training, Kesi,<br />
					what do you do?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a tamable horse does not submit<br />
					either to a mild training<br />
					or to a harsh training<br />
					or to a mild and harsh training, lord,<br />
					then I kill it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">[I think:] 'Don't let this be a disgrace to my lineage of teachers.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One, lord,<br />
					is the unexcelled trainer of tamable people.</p>

					<p class="f4">How do you train a tamable person?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kesi, I train a tamable person<br />
					[sometimes] with mildness,<br />
					[sometimes] with harshness,<br />
					[sometimes] with both mildness and harshness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In using mildness,<br />
					[I teach:] 'Such is good bodily conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of good bodily conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is good verbal conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of good verbal conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is good mental conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of good mental conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are human beings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"In using harshness,<br />
					[I teach:] 'Such is bodily misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of bodily misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is verbal misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of verbal misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the animal womb.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such the realm of the hungry shades.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"In using mildness and harshness,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such is the result of bodily misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if a tamable person does not submit<br />
					either to a mild training<br />
					or to a harsh training<br />
					or to a mild and harsh training,<br />
					what do you do?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a tamable person does not submit<br />
					either to a mild training<br />
					or to a harsh training<br />
					or to a mild and harsh training,<br />
					then I kill him, Kesi."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But it's not proper for our Blessed One to take life!</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet the Blessed One just said,<br />
					'I kill him, Kesi.'"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="kill">"It is true,</a> Kesi,<br />
					that it's not proper for a Tathāgata to take life.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if a tamable person does not submit<br />
					either to a mild training<br />
					or to a harsh training<br />
					or to a mild and harsh training,<br />
					then the Tathāgata does not regard him<br />
					as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing.</p>

					<p class="f4">His observant companions in the holy life<br />
					do not regard him<br />
					as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what it means to be totally destroyed<br />
					in the Dhamma and Vinaya,<br />
					when the Tathāgata does not regard one<br />
					as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing,<br />
					and one's observant companions in the holy life<br />
					do not regard one as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, wouldn't one be totally destroyed<br />
					if the Tathāgata does not regard one<br />
					as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing,<br />
					and one's observant companions in the holy life<br />
					do not regard one as being worth speaking to<br />
					or admonishing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright<br />
					what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has the Blessed One<br />
					— through many lines of reasoning —<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the community of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me<br />
					as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge,<br />
					from this day forward,<br />
					for life."</p>
