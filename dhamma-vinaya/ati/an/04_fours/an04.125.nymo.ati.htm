<meta name="description" content="The Ñanamoli Thera translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 125. The Buddha describes four paths to deva worlds based on the four devine lifestyles: friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment. Then he points out that the destinies of those who are students of the Dhamma are non-returners while those of other beliefs return to the round of rebirths." />

					he abides with his heart abundant, exalted,<br />
					measureless in loving-kindness,<br />
					without hostility or ill-will,<br />
					extending over the all-encompassing world.</p>

					[who has not attained the Noble Eightfold Path]<br />
					stays there for his life-span;<br />
					but after he has used up<br />
					the whole life-span enjoyed by those gods,<br />
					he leaves it all, and<br />
					[according to what his past deeds may have been]<br />
					he may go down even to hell,<br />
					or to an animal womb,<br />
					or to the ghost realm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But one who has given ear to the Perfect One<br />
					stays there [in that heaven] for his life-span,<br />

					he eventually attains complete extinction<br />
					of lust, hate and delusion<br />
					in that same kind of heavenly existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is this that distinguishes,<br />
					that differentiates,<br />
					the wise hearer who is ennobled<br />
					[by attainment of the Noble Path]<br />
					from the unwise ordinary man,<br />
					when, that is to say,<br />
					there is a destination for reappearance<br />
					[after death, but an Arahant has made an end of birth].</p>
