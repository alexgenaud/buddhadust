					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Objectification" is a translation of <i>papañca</i>. Although in some circles <i>papañca</i> has come to mean a proliferation of thinking, in the Canon it refers not to the amount of thinking, but to a type of thinking marked by the classifications and perceptions it uses. As <a href="../../kd/snp/snp.4-14.than.ati.htm">Sn 4:14</a> points out, the root of the classifications and perceptions of objectification is the thought, "I am the thinker." This thought forms the motivation for the questions that Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita is presenting here: the sense of "I am the thinker" can cause either fear or desire for annihilation in the course of unbinding. Both sense of compunctions get in the way of the abandoning of clinging, which is essential for the attainment of unbinding, which is why the questions should not be asked.<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p21">DN 21</a> and <a href="../../mn/mn.018.than.ati.htm">MN 18</a> discuss the relationship between objectification and conflict. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm">SN 43</a> lists non-objectification as one of many epithets for unbinding.</p>
