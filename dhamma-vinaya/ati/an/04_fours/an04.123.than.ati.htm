					<p class="f4">Which four?"</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where an individual,<br />
					quite secluded from from sensuality,<br />
					secluded from from unskillful qualities,<br />
					enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born from seclusion,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He savors that,<br />
					longs for that,<br />
					finds satisfaction through that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Staying there — fixed on that,<br />
					dwelling there often,<br />
					not falling away from that<br />
					— then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the devas of Brahma's retinue.</p>

					<p class="f4">The devas of Brahma's retinue, monks,<br />
					have a life-span of an eon.</p>

					<p class="f4">A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there,<br />
					having used up all the life-span of those devas,<br />
					goes to hell,<br />
					to the animal womb,<br />
					to the state of the hungry ghosts.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a disciple of the Blessed One,<br />
					having stayed there,<br />
					having used up all the life-span of those devas,<br />
					is unbound right in that state of being.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the difference,<br />
					this the distinction,<br />
					this the distinguishing factor,<br />
					between an educated disciple of the noble ones<br />
					and an uneducated run-of-the-mill person,<br />
					when there is a destination, a reappearing.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, there is the case where an individual,<br />
					with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations,<br />
					enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of composure,<br />
					unification of awareness<br />
					free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">He savors that,<br />
					longs for that,<br />
					finds satisfaction through that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Staying there — fixed on that,<br />
					dwelling there often,<br />
					not falling away from that<br />
					— then when he dies he reappears in conjunction with the Abhassara [Radiant] devas.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The Abhassara devas, monks,<br />
					have a life-span of two eons.</p>

					<p class="f4">A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there,<br />
					having used up all the life-span of those devas,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, there is the case where an individual,<br />
					with the fading of rapture,<br />
					remains equanimous, mindful, and alert,<br />
					and senses pleasure with the body,<br />
					and enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He savors that,<br />
					longs for that,<br />
					finds satisfaction through that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Staying there — fixed on that,<br />
					dwelling there often,<br />
					not falling away from that<br />
					— then when he dies<br />
					he reappears in conjunction with the Subhakinha [Beautiful Black] devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Subhakinha devas, monks,<br />
					have a life-span of four eons.</p>

					<p class="f4">A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there,<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Again, there is the case<br />
					where an individual,<br />
					with the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance<br />
					of elation and distress —<br />
					enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He savors that,<br />
					longs for that,<br />

					<p class="f4">Staying there — fixed on that,<br />
					dwelling there often,<br />
					not falling away from that<br />
					— then when he dies<br />
					he reappears in conjunction with the Vehapphala [Sky-fruit] devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Vehapphala devas, monks,<br />
					have a life-span of 500 eons.</p>

					<p class="f4">A run-of-the-mill person having stayed there,<br />
