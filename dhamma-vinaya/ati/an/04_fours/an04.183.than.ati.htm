					<p class="f4">"I am of the view, of the opinion, that when anyone speaks of what he has seen, [saying,] 'Thus have I seen,' there is no fault in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">When anyone speaks of what he has heard, [saying,] 'Thus have I heard,' there is no fault in that.</p>

					<p class="f4">[The Blessed One responded:] "I do not say, brahman, that everything that has been seen should be spoken about.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, for one who speaks of what has been seen, unskillful qualities increase and skillful qualities decrease, then that sort of thing should not be spoken about.</p>
