					a monk is incapable of falling away<br />
					and is right in the presence of Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk is consummate in virtue,<br />
					guards the doors to his sense faculties,<br />
					knows moderation in eating, and<br />
					is devoted to wakefulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk consummate in virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is virtuous.<br />
					He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha,<br />
					consummate in his behavior and<br />
					sphere of activity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He trains himself,<br />
					having undertaken the training rules,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is consummate in virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk guard the doors to his sense faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />
					on seeing a form with the eye,<br />
					doen't grasp at any theme or variations by which<br />
					— if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye —<br />
					evil, unskillful qualities<br />
					such as greed or distress<br />
					might assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practices with restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">He guards the faculty of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">"On hearing a sound with the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">"On smelling an aroma with the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">"On tasting a flavor with the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">"On feeling a tactile sensation with the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"On cognizing an idea with the intellect,<br />
					he does not grasp at any theme or variations by which<br />
					— if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the intellect —<br />
					evil, unskillful qualities<br />
					such as greed or distress might assail him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practices with restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">He guards the faculty of the intellect.</p>

					<p class="f4">He achieves restraint with regard to the faculty of the intellect.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk guards the doors to his sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk know moderation in eating?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />
					considering it appropriately,<br />
					takes his food not playfully,<br />
					nor for intoxication,<br />
					nor for putting on bulk,<br />
					nor for beautification,<br />
					but simply for the survival and continuance of this body,<br />
					for ending its afflictions,<br />
					for the support of the holy life, thinking,<br />
					'I will destroy old feelings [of hunger]<br />
					and not create new feelings [from overeating].</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus I will maintain myself,<br />
					be blameless,<br />
					and live in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk knows moderation in eating.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk devoted to wakefulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk during the day,<br />
					sitting and pacing back and forth,<br />
					cleanses his mind of any qualities<br />
					that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the first watch of the night [dusk to 10 p.m.],<br />
					sitting and pacing back and forth,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of any qualities<br />
					that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the second watch of the night [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.],<br />
					reclining on his right side,<br />
					he takes up the lion's posture,<br />
					one foot placed on top of the other,<br />
					mindful, alert,<br />
					with his mind set on getting up<br />
					[either as soon as he awakens or at a particular time].</p>

					<p class="f4">During the last watch of the night [2 a.m. to dawn],<br />
					sitting and pacing back and forth,<br />
					he cleanses his mind of any qualities<br />
					that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is devoted to wakefulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Endowed with these four qualities,<br />
					a monk is incapable of falling away<br />
					and is right in the presence of Unbinding."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">The monk established in virtue,<br />
							restrained with regard to the sense faculties,<br />
							knowing moderation in food,<br />
							and devoted to wakefulness:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dwelling thus ardently,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; day and night, untiring,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he develops skillful qualities<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the attainment of rest from the yoke.<br />
							The monk delighting in heedfulness<br />
							and seeing danger in heedlessness<br />
							is incapable of falling away,<br />
							is right in the presence of Unbinding.</p>
