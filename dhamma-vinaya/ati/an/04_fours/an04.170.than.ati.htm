					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Friends!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Ānanda said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, whoever — monk or nun — declares the attainment of arahantship in my presence,<br />

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where a monk has developed insight preceded by tranquillity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He follows that path,<br />
					develops it,<br />
					pursues it.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he follows the path,<br />
					developing it and pursuing it —<br />
					his fetters are abandoned,<br />
					his obsessions destroyed.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case<br />

					<p class="f4">As he develops tranquillity in tandem with insight,<br />

					[Comm: the corruptions of insight]<br />

					<p class="f4">There comes a time<br />
