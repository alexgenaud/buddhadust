					<h4>Translator's note:</h4>

					<p>This is one of the few protective charms mentioned in the Pali Canon and specifically allowed by the Buddha for monks to use (another charm, also allowed to the monks, is contained in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p32">DN 32</a>). Note that the power of the charm is said to come, not from the words, but from the mind of good will with which they are said. It thus differs from charms taught in later forms of Buddhism, where the words themselves are said to contain power.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>The Virūpakkhas are the chiefs of the nāgas, associated with the western quarter (see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p20">DN 20</a>). The other royal lineages of snakes are nowhere else mentioned in the Pali Canon. The commentary to this discourse does not identify them.  The Dark Gotamakas may be the cobra family.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>The seven most recent Buddhas, including "our" Buddha, are mentioned in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p14">DN 14</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p32">DN 32</a>: Vipassi, Sikhi, Vessabhū, Kakusandha, Koṇāgamana, Kassapa, and Gotama. It's noteworthy that the concept of the seven Buddhas is associated with protective charms. For example, the heart of the charm given in DN 32 is this:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Homage to Vipassin, possessed of vision and splendor.<br />
					Homage to Sikhi, sympathetic to all beings.<br />
					Homage to Vessabhū, cleansed, austere.<br />
					Homage to Kakusandha, crusher of Māra's host.<br />
					Homage to Koṇāgamana, the Brahman who lived<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the life perfected.<br />
					Homage to Kassapa, entirely released.<br />
					Homage to Aṇgīrasa [Gotama], <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; splendid son of the Sakyans,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who taught this Dhamma:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dispelling of all stress and pain.<br />
					Those unbound in the world,<br />
					who have seen things as they are,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; great ones of gentle speech,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thoroughly mature,<br />
					even they pay homage to Gotama,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the benefit of human and heavenly beings,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummate in knowledge and conduct,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the great one, thoroughly mature.<br />
					We revere the Buddha Gotama,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consummate in knowledge and conduct.</p>
