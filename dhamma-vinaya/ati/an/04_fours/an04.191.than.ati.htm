					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk has mastered the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question and answer sessions [the earliest classifications of the Buddha's teachings].</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, these teachings have been followed by ear, recited by speech, examined by mind, and well penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away when his mindfulness is muddled, he arises in a certain group of devas. To him, happy there, they recite verses of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Slow is the arising of his mindfulness, but when mindful,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he quickly arrives at distinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the teachings have been followed by ear, recited by speech, examined by mind, and well penetrated by view, this is the first reward that can be expected.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where a monk has mastered the Dhamma: dialogues... question and answer sessions.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him, these teachings have been followed by ear, recited by speech, examined by mind, and well penetrated by view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away when his mindfulness is muddled, he arises in a certain group of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">It doesn't happen that they recite verses of Dhamma to him, happy there.</p>

					<p class="f4">But a monk<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> with psychic power, attained to mastery of awareness, teaches the Dhamma to the assembly of devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurs [to the new deva]:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the Dhamma and Vinaya under which I used to live the holy life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Slow is the arising of his mindfulness, but when mindful, he quickly arrives at distinction.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man skilled in the sound of a war drum were to hear the sound of a war drum while traveling along a highway.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would have no doubt or perplexity, 'Is that the sound of a war drum or not the sound of a war drum?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He would come to the conclusion, 'That's the sound of a war drum for sure.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It doesn't happen that they recite verses of Dhamma to him, happy there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nor does a monk with psychic power, attained to mastery of awareness, teach the Dhamma to the assembly of devas.</p>
