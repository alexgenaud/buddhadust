					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Sāvatthi at Jetavana at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. At that time at Sāvatthi a certain monk had died bitten by a snake. Thereupon many monks approached the Buddha and having saluted him sat beside him. So seated those monks spoke thus to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhante (Venerable Sir), a certain monk at Sāvatthi had died bitten by a snake."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Assuredly, monks," said the Buddha. "That monk has not suffused with thoughts of loving-kindness (metta) the four royal tribes of snakes. Had he done so, that monk would not have died of snake-bite. What are the four royal tribes of snakes? The royal tribe of snakes called Virupakkha, Erapatha, Chabyaputta, and KanhaGotamaka. Monks, that monk, did not suffuse with thoughts of loving-kindness these four royal tribes of snakes, had not done so he would not have died of snake-bite. Monks, I enjoin you to suffuse with thoughts of loving-kindness these four royal tribes of snakes for your safety, for your preservation and for your protection." So said the Blessed One. Having thus spoken, the Buddha, the "Welcome One" <i>(Sugata),</i> further said (suggesting how they should express themselves:)</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">1. May I have metta towards Virupakkhas<br />
					Towards Erapathas may I have metta<br />
					May my metta be towards Chabyaputtas<br />
					Towards Kanha-Gotamakas also metta may I have.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">2. May I have metta towards the footless<br />
					And towards bipeds too, my metta may I have<br />
					May I have metta towards the quadrupeds<br />
					And towards the many footed also, metta may I have.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">3. Let not the footless do me harm<br />
					Nor those that have two feet<br />
					Let not quadrupeds do me harm<br />
					Nor those endowed with many feet.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">4. All beings, all living creatures,<br />
					May good fortune befall them all<br />
					May not the least harm on them befall.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"Infinite (in virtue) is the Buddha, infinite is the Dhamma, infinite is the Saŋgha. Finite are creeping creatures -- snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and rats. I have guarded myself, I have made my protection. Depart from me, ye beings. I bow down to the Blessed One; and to the seven Supreme Buddhas."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
