<meta name="description" content="The Bhkkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 125. The Buddha describes four paths to deva worlds based on the four devine lifestyles: friendliness, sympathy, empathy and detachment. Then he points out that the destinies of those who are students of the Dhamma are non-returners while those of other beliefs return to the round of rebirths." />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Ābhassara, Subhakinha, and Vehapphala Devas are all Brahmās on the level of form.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This sutta, read in conjunction with <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p123">AN 4.123,</a> has given rise to the belief that the development of goodwill as an immeasurable state can lead only to the first jhāna, and that the next two immeasurable states — compassion and empathetic joy — can lead, respectively, only to the second and third jhānas. However, as <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p63">AN 8.63</a> shows, all four immeasurable states can lead all the way to the fourth jhāna. The difference between that discourse and this lies in how the person practicing these states relates to them. In that sutta, the person deliberately uses the state as a basis for developing all the jhānas. In this sutta, the person simply enjoys the state and remains in it.</p>
