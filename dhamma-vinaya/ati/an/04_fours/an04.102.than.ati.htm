<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Sutta 102. Gotama likens four sorts of persons to four sorts of rain-clouds: one that thunders but doesn't rain, one that rains but doesn't thunder, one that neither rains nor thunders, one that both rains and thunders. He defines mastery of Dhamma as thundering, understanding the Four Truths as raining." />
