<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 24. The Buddha explains that his statement that he knows and understands whatsoever in the world, with its Māras, Brahmās, hosts of recluses and brahmins, devas and mankind, is seen, heard, sensed, cognized, attained, searched into, pondered over by the mind, is to be understood as a simple statement of fact and is not a brag and that because he does know these things, to say otherwise would be a lie." />

					There he addressed the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks, whatever in this world —||<br />
					with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās,||<br />
					its generations with their contemplatives and brahmans||<br />
					rulers and common people —||<br />
					is seen,||<br />
					heard,||<br />
					sensed,||<br />
					cognized,||<br />
					attained,||<br />
					sought after,||<br />
					pondered by the intellect:||<br />
					That do I know.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever in the world||<br />
					— with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās,||<br />
					its generations with their contemplatives and brahmans,||<br />
					their rulers and common people —||<br />
					is seen, heard, sensed, cognized,||<br />
					attained, sought after, pondered by the intellect:||<br />
					That I directly know.</p>

					<p class="f4">That has been realized by the Tathāgata,||<br />
					but in the Tathāgata<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> it has not been established.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"If I were to say,||<br />
					'I don't know whatever in the world ...||<br />
					is seen, heard, sensed, cognized ...||<br />
					pondered by the intellect,'||<br />
					that would be a falsehood in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to say,||<br />
					'I both know and don't know whatever in the world ...||<br />
					is seen, heard, sensed, cognized ...||<br />
					pondered by the intellect,'||<br />
					that would be just the same.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I were to say,||<br />
					'I neither know nor don't know whatever in the world ...||<br />
					is seen, heard, sensed, cognized ...||<br />
					pondered by the intellect,'||<br />
					that would be a fault in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, the Tathāgata,||<br />
					when seeing what is to be seen,||<br />
					doesn't suppose an [object as] seen.||<br />
					He doesn't suppose an unseen.||<br />
					He doesn't suppose an [object] to-be-seen.||<br />
					He doesn't suppose a seer.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When hearing....</p>

					<p class="f4">"When sensing....</p>

					<p class="f4">"When cognizing what is to be cognized,||<br />
					he doesn't suppose an [object as] cognized.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't suppose an uncognized.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't suppose an [object] to-be-cognized.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't suppose a cognizer.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus, monks, the Tathāgata||<br />
					— being the same with regard to all phenomena||<br />
					that can be seen, heard, sensed, and cognized —||<br />
					is 'Such.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">And I tell you:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There's no other 'Such'||<br />
					higher or more sublime.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"Whatever is seen or heard or sensed<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and fastened onto as true by others,<br />
					One who is Such — among the self-fettered — <br />
					wouldn't further claim to be true or even false.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"Having seen well in advance that arrow<br />
					where generations are fastened and hung<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> — 'I know, I see, that's just how it is!' — </i><br />
					there's nothing of the Tathāgata fastened."</p>
