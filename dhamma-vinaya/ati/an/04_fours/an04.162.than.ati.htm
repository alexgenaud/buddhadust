					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, this means the concentration forming the Path. This is apparently a reference to this passage in <a href="../../kd/snp/snp.2-01.than.ati.htm">Sn 2.1</a>:</p>

						<p class="in4">What the excellent Awakened One extolled as pure<br />
						and called the concentration<br />
						of unmediated knowing:<br />
						No equal to that concentration can be found.<br />
						This, too, is an exquisite treasure in the Dhamma.<br />
