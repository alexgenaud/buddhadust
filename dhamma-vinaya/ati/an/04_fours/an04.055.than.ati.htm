<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fours, Sutta 55. Nakula's mother and father each approach the Buddha and each, in identical words, states that they are not aware of the other ever having transgressed against them either in thought or deed and then state that they are desirous of seeing each other in lives to come. The Buddha instructs them in how such a thing is to be attained." />
