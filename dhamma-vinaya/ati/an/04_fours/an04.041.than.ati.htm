					secluded from unskillful qualities —<br />

					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the stilling of directed thought and evaluation,<br />
					he enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of concentration,<br />
					unification of awareness<br />
					free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading of rapture<br />
					he remains in equanimity,<br />
					mindful and alert,<br />
					and senses pleasure with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasurable abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress —<br />
					he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> For more on the third development of concentration, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p149">MN 149</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_54_anapanasamyutta.htm#p8">SN 54:8</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p63">AN 8:63</a> [DTO 70]. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p111">MN 111</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p121">MN 121</a>, which discuss the perceptions and feelings that arise and disappear on shifting from one level of concentration to another would also seem to be relevant here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The difference between the third and fourth developments of concentration is apparently that in the fourth, the aggregates are viewed not only in terms of their arising but also their origination: what <i>causes</i> them to arise. For more on the fourth development of concentration, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p52">MN 52</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p5">SN 22:5</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p124">AN 4:124</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p126">AN 4:126</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_05_pancakanipata.htm#p28">AN 5:28</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p36">AN 9:36</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It is sometimes argued that the first development of concentration is the only one that falls under the four jhānas, but the passages cited in these notes all show that jhāna is involved in all four developments. The difference lies in how the practice of jhāna is used.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Imperturbability is a quality of concentration that allows it to be used for the second and fourth developments of concentration (see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p4">MN 4</a>). For more on imperturbable concentration, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p66">MN 66</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p106">MN 106</a>. On an even higher level, the arahant’s mind is said to be imperturbable in the face of all sensory input. On this point, see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p55">AN 6:55</a>.</p>
