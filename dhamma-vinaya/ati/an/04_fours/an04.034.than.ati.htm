					<p class="f4">"Among whatever communities or groups there may be, the Saṅgha of the Tathāgata’s disciples is considered supreme—i.e., the four [groups of noble disciples] when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as persons.<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Those who have confidence in the Saṅgha have confidence in what is supreme; and for those with confidence in the supreme, supreme will be the result.</p>

					  <pre>With 
					confidence,
						realizing the supreme Dhamma

					confidence in the supreme Buddha,
						unsurpassed

					confidence in the supreme Dhamma,
						the bliss of stilling, dispassion;
					confidence in the supreme Saṅgha,
						unsurpassed

						one develops supreme merit,
						supreme long life and beauty, 
						status, honor, 
					bliss, and strength.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The four groups of noble disciples when taken as pairs are those who have attained (1) the path to stream-entry and the fruition of stream-entry; (2) the path to once-returning and the fruition of once-returning; (3) the path to non-returning and the fruition of non-returning; and (4) the path to arahantship and the fruition of arahantship. Taking each attainment singly gives eight "individuals."</p>
