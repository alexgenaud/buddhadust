					'The nun named such-and-such, venerable sir,<br />

					<p class="f4">Responding, "Yes, my lady,"<br />
					the man then went to Ven. Ānanda<br />

					Ven. Ānanda went to the nuns' quarters.</p>

					and so unskilled as to act in this way.</p>

					<p class="f4">May my lord Ānanda please accept this confession of my transgression as such,<br />
					so that I may restrain myself in the future."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sister, a transgression overcame you<br />
					in that you were so foolish,<br />
					so muddle-headed,<br />
					and so unskilled as to act in this way.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because you see your transgression as such<br />
					and make amends in accordance with the Dhamma,<br />
					we accept your confession.</p>

					<p class="f4">For it is a cause of growth<br />
					in the Dhamma and discipline of the noble ones<br />
					when, seeing a transgression as such,<br />
					one makes amends in accordance with the Dhamma<br />
					and exercises restraint in the future."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ven. Ānanda said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the nun delighted in Ven. Ānanda's words.</p>
