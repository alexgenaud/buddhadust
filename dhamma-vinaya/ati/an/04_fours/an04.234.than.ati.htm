Which four? There is kamma that is dark with dark result. There is kamma that is bright with bright result. There is kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright result. There is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, leading to the ending of kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is kamma that is dark with dark result? There is the case where a certain person is one who takes life, is one who takes what is not given, is one who engages in illicit sex, is one who tells lies, is one who takes fermented and distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessness This is called kamma that is dark with dark result.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is kamma that is bright with bright result? There is the case where a certain person is one who abstains from taking life, is one who abstains from taking what is not given, is one who abstains from engaging in illicit sex, is one who abstains from telling lies, is one who abstains from taking fermented and distilled liquors that are the basis for heedlessness This is called kamma that is bright with bright result.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright result? There is the case where a certain person fabricates a bodily fabrication that is injurious and non-injurious… a verbal fabrication that is injurious and non-injurious… a mental fabrication that is injurious and non-injurious.… He rearises in an injurious and non-injurious world.… There he is touched by injurious and non-injurious contacts.… He experiences injurious and non-injurious feelings, pleasure mingled with pain, like those of human beings, some devas, and some beings in the lower realms. This is called kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright result.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, leading to the ending of kamma? The intention right there to abandon this kamma that is dark with dark result, the intention right there to abandon this kamma that is bright with bright result, the intention right there to abandon this kamma that is dark and bright with dark and bright result. This is called kamma that is neither dark nor bright with neither dark nor bright result, leading to the ending of kamma.</p>
