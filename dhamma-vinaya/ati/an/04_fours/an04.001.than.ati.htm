					There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating four things<br />
					that we have wandered and transmigrated<br />
					on such a long, long time, you and I.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble virtue<br />
					that we have wandered and transmigrated<br />
					on such a long, long time, you and I.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble concentration<br />
					that we have wandered and transmigrated<br />
					on such a long, long time, you and I.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble discernment<br />
					that we have wandered and transmigrated<br />
					on such a long, long time, you and I.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's because of not understanding and not penetrating noble release<br />
					that we have wandered and transmigrated<br />
					on such a long, long time, you and I.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when noble virtue is understood and penetrated,<br />
					when noble concentration...<br />
					noble discernment...<br />
					noble release is understood and penetrated,<br />
					then craving for becoming is destroyed,<br />
					the guide to becoming (craving and attachment) is ended,<br />
					there is now no further becoming."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the One Well-gone had said that,<br />
					he — the Teacher — said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Unexcelled virtue, concentration,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discernment, and release:<br />
					have been understood by Gotama of glorious stature.<br />
					Having known them directly,<br />
					he taught the Dhamma to the monks — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Awakened One<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Teacher who has put an end to suffering and stress,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the One with vision<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; totally unbound.					</p>
