					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> A perception with a share in decline is one that causes the mind to fall from concentration. A perception with a share in stability is one that helps to maintain concentration. A perception with a share in distinction is one that leads to higher stages of concentration. A perception with a share in penetration is one leading to liberating insight.</p>
