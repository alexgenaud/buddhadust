					conquers displeasure and isn't conquered by displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he lives in the west...<br />
					the north...<br />
					the south,<br />
					he conquers displeasure<br />
					and isn't conquered by displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the enlightened one endures both delight and displeasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said this, he said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Displeasure doesn't conquer&nbsp;&nbsp;the enlightened one.<br />
					Displeasure doesn't suppress&nbsp;&nbsp;the enlightened one.<br />
					The enlightened one&nbsp;&nbsp;conquers displeasure<br />
					because the enlightened one&nbsp;&nbsp;endures it.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Having cast away all deeds:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who could obstruct him?<br />
					Like an ornament of finest <a id="gold">gold</a>:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who is fit to find fault with him?<br />
					Even the Devas praise him,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even by <a id="brahma">Brahma</a> is he praised.</p>
