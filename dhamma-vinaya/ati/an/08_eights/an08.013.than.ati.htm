					<p class="f4">[8] "He is steadfast and remains steadfast to the end of life and death.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">[1] "There is the case where a monk is virtuous.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">[2] "When given food, whether coarse or refined, he eats it carefully, without complaining.</p>

					<p class="f4">[3] "He feels disgust at bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct, at the development of evil, unskillful (mental) qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">[4] "He is composed and easy to live with, and doesn't harass the other monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">[5] "Whatever tricks or deceits or wiles or subterfuges he has, he shows them as they actually are to the Teacher or to his observant companions in the holy life, so that the Teacher or his observant companions in the holy life can try to straighten them out.</p>

					<p class="f4">[7] "When going, he goes the straight path; here the straight path is this: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">[8] "He dwells with his persistence aroused, (thinking,) 'Gladly would I let the flesh and blood in my body dry up, leaving just the skin, tendons, and bones, but if I have not attained what can be reached through human steadfastness, human persistence, human striving, there will be no relaxing my persistence.'"</p>
