					<p class="f4">And at that time Ven. Anuruddha was living among the <a id="ceti">Cetis</a> in the Eastern Bamboo Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as he was alone in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in Ven. Anuruddha's awareness:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one who is entangled.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for whose discernment is weak."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, realizing with his awareness the line of thinking in Ven. Anuruddha's awareness — just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — disappeared from among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Forest, near Crocodile Haunt, and re-appeared among the Cetis in the Eastern Bamboo Park, right in front of Ven. Anuruddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he sat down on a prepared seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">As for Ven. Anuruddha, having bowed down to the Blessed One, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Anuruddha, very good.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's good that you think these thoughts of a great person:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Dhamma is for one who is modest, not for one who is self-aggrandizing.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who is reclusive, not for one who is entangled.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose mindfulness is established, not for one whose mindfulness is confused.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one whose mind is concentrated, not for one whose mind is unconcentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one endowed with discernment, not for one whose discernment is weak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now then, Anuruddha, think the eighth thought of a great person:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Dhamma is for one who enjoys non-objectification,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> who delights in non-objectification, not for one who enjoys and delights in objectification.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Anuruddha, when you think these eight thoughts of a great person, then — whenever you want — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, you will enter and remain in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born from seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, then — whenever you want — with the stilling of directed thought and evaluation, you will enter and remain in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance...</p>

					<p class="f4">with the fading of rapture, you will remain equanimous, mindful and alert, and sense pleasure with the body. You will enter and remain in the third jhāna, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When you think these eight thoughts of a great person, then — whenever you want — with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress, you will enter and remain in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, when you think these eight thoughts of a great person and become a person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four jhānas — heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the here and now — then your robe of cast-off rags will seem to you to be just like the clothes chest of a householder or householder's son, full of clothes of many colors.</p>

					<p class="f4">As you live contented, it will serve for your delight, for a comfortable abiding, for non-agitation, and for alighting on Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When you think these eight thoughts of a great person and become a person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four jhānas — heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the here and now — then your meal of almsfood will seem to you to be just like the rice and wheat of a householder or householder's son, cleaned of black grains, and served with a variety of sauces and seasonings...</p>

					<p class="f4">your dwelling at the foot of a tree will seem to you to be just like the gabled mansion of a householder or householder's son, plastered inside and out, draft-free, bolted, and with its shutters closed...</p>

					<p class="f4">your bed on a spread of grass will seem to you like the couch of a householder or householder's son, spread with long-haired coverlets, white woolen coverlets, embroidered coverlets, antelope-hide and deer-skin rugs, covered with a canopy, and with red cushions for the head and feet...</p>

					<p class="f4">"When you think these eight thoughts of a great person and become a person who can attain at will, without trouble or difficulty, these four jhānas — heightened mental states providing a pleasant abiding in the here and now — then your medicine of strong-smelling urine will seem to you to be just like the various tonics of a householder or householder's son: ghee, fresh butter, oil, honey, and molasses sugar.</p>

					<p class="f4">As you live contented, it will serve for your delight, for a comfortable abiding, for non-agitation, and for alighting on Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, then, Anuruddha, you are to stay right here among the Cetis for the coming Rains Retreat."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Anuruddha replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having given this exhortation to Ven. Anuruddha, the Blessed One — as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm — disappeared from the Eastern Bamboo Park of the Cetis and reappeared among the Bhaggas in the Deer Park at Bhesakaḷā Forest, near Crocodile Haunt.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sat down on a prepared seat and, as he was sitting there, he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will teach you the eight thoughts of a great person.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p8great">The Blessed</a> One said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what are the eight thoughts of a great person?</p>

					<p class="f4">This Dhamma is for one who is content, not for one who is discontent.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, when living reclusively, is visited by monks, nuns, lay men, lay women, kings, royal ministers, sectarians and their disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his mind bent on seclusion, tending toward seclusion, inclined toward seclusion, aiming at seclusion, relishing renunciation, he converses with them only as much is necessary for them to take their leave.</p>

					<p class="f4">With reference to what was it said?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful mental qualities and taking on skillful mental qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful mental qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Dhamma is for one whose persistence is aroused, not for one who is lazy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was it said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was it said.</p>

					<p class="f4">And with reference to this was it said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was it said.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="victory">Now, during</a> the following Rains Retreat, Ven. Anuruddha stayed right there in the Eastern Bamboo Park among the Cetis.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for the sake of this world."</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus Ven. Anuruddha became another one of the arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on attaining arahantship, he uttered this verse:</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Knowing my thoughts,<br />
							the Teacher, unexcelled in the cosmos,<br />
							came to me through his power<br />
							in a body made of mind.<br />
							He taught in line with my thoughts,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and then further.<br />
							The Buddha,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; delighting in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-objectification,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; taught &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-objectification.<br />
							Knowing his Dhamma,<br />
							I kept delighting in his bidding.<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The three knowledges<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have been attained;<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Buddha's bidding,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; done.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Objectification" is a translation of <i>papañca.</i> Although in some circles <i>papañca</i> has come to mean a proliferation of thinking, in the Canon it refers not to the amount of thinking, but to a type of thinking marked by the classifications and perceptions it uses. As <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp52">Sn 4:14</a> points out, the root of these classifications and perceptions is the thought, "I am the thinker." From this assumption grow such classifications as "me/not me," "existing/not existing," which frame experience in terms conducive to further becoming. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p21">DN 21</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p18">MN 18</a> discuss the relationship between objectification and conflict. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p174">AN 4:174</a> (ATI/DTO #173) states that the range of objectification is identical with the range of the six sense media. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm">SN 43</a> lists non-objectification as one of many epithets for unbinding.</p>
