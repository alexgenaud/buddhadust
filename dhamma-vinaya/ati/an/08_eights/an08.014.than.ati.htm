					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, speaks waving his arms around in the midst of the Saŋgha.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — rears up and paws the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, not heeding the Saŋgha, not heeding his accuser, goes off where he will, still an offender.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — not heeding the goad, bites through the bit with its teeth and goes where it will.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, [after saying,]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'I've neither committed an offense, nor have I not committed an offense,' vexes the Saŋgha by falling silent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — goes neither forward nor back, but stands right there like a post.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, says this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Why do you venerable ones persecute me so much?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I'll disavow the training and return to the lower life.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On having disavowed the training and returned to the lower life he says, 'I hope you venerable ones are gratified now!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — draws in its forefeet, draws in its hind feet, and sits down right there on its four feet.</p>
