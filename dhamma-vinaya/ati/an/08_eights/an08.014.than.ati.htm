					<p class="f4">"Now, which are the eight unruly horses and eight faults in horses?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where some unruly horses — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — back up and push the chariot back with their hindquarters.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, denies the offense, [saying,]</p>

					<p class="f4">'I don't remember.</p>

					<p class="f4">I don't remember.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — backs up and pushes the chariot back with its hindquarters.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — jumps back and hits the carriage railing, breaking the triple bar.</p>

					<p class="f4">'You, too, have committed an offense of this name.</p>

					<p class="f4">You make amends for it first.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — kicks the chariot pole and stomps on it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, wanders from one thing to another, straying outside the topic, displaying anger, irritation, and sulkiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — goes off the road and makes the chariot turn over.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, speaks waving his arms around in the midst of the Saṇgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — rears up and paws the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, not heeding the Saṇgha, not heeding his accuser, goes off where he will, still an offender.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — not heeding the goad, bites through the bit with its teeth and goes where it will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, [after saying,]</p>

					<p class="f4">'I've neither committed an offense, nor have I not committed an offense,' vexes the Saṇgha by falling silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — goes neither forward nor back, but stands right there like a post.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monks accuse a monk of an offense.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, being accused of an offense by the monks, says this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Why do you venerable ones persecute me so much?</p>

					<p class="f4">I'll disavow the training and return to the lower life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">On having disavowed the training and returned to the lower life he says, 'I hope you venerable ones are gratified now!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He, I tell you, is just like the unruly horse who — when goaded, ordered, and told 'Go!' by the charioteer — draws in its forefeet, draws in its hind feet, and sits down right there on its four feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">Some unruly men are like this.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the eighth fault in a man.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are the eight unruly men and eight faults in men."</p>
