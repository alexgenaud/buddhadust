					<p class="f4">Which eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk lives in apprenticeship to the Teacher or to a respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has established a strong sense of sense of shame &amp; compunction, love, and respect.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first cause, the first requisite condition that leads to the acquiring of the as-yet-unacquired discernment that is basic to the holy life, and to the increase, plenitude, development, and culmination of that which has already been acquired.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he lives in apprenticeship under the Teacher or under a respectable comrade in the holy life in whom he has established a strong sense of sense of shame, &amp; compunction, love, and respect, he approaches him at the appropriate times to quiz &amp; cross-question him:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'What, venerable sir, is the meaning of this statement?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He [the Teacher or the respectable comrade in the holy life] reveals what is hidden, makes plain what is obscure, and dispels perplexity in many kinds of perplexing things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the second cause, the second requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having heard the Dhamma, he [the student] achieves a twofold seclusion: seclusion in body and seclusion in mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the third cause, the third requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is virtuous.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fourth cause, the fourth requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"He has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what he has heard.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that — in their meaning and expression — proclaim the holy life that is entirely entirely perfect, surpassingly pure: Those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, accumulated, examined with his mind, and well-penetrated in terms of his views.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the fifth cause, the fifth requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and for taking on skillful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the sixth cause, the sixth requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"When he is in the midst of the Saŋgha he doesn't talk on and on about a variety of things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Either he speaks Dhamma himself or he invites another to do so, and he feels no disdain for <a id="silence">noble silence</a>.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the seventh cause, the seventh requisite condition...</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on arising and passing away with regard to the five aggregates:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is feeling...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is perception...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such are fabrications...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the eighth cause, the eighth requisite condition that leads to the acquiring of the as-yet-unacquired discernment that is basic to the holy life, and to the increase, plenitude, development, and culmination of that which has already been acquired.</p>
