					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Pali here reads, <i>na āyataken'eva papāto.</i> Literally, this means, "not for quite a long stretch a sudden drop-off." The Commentary, however, insists that this phrase means, "with no abrupt drop-off." NDB follows the Commentary in translating it as "not dropping off abruptly," but there are three reasons for not accepting the Commentary's interpretation here. (a) The first is grammatical. The word <i>āyataka</i> means "long, drawn out; lasting a long time." To interpret <i>āyatakena,</i> the instrumental of a word meaning "long, drawn out," to mean "abrupt" makes little sense. (b) The second reason is geographical. The continental shelf off the east coast of India does have a sudden drop-off after a long gradual slope. (c) The third reason is doctrinal. When the Buddha takes the shape of the ocean floor as a simile for the course of the practice, the sudden drop-off stands for penetration to gnosis. If there were no abrupt sudden drop-off, there would be no abrupt penetration to awakening. However, there are many cases of sudden penetration in the Canon, prime examples being Ven. Bāhiya's attainment of arahantship in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p10">Ud 1:10</a>, and Ven. Ānanda's attainment in Cv 11:1.6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> <i>Anupādisesāya nibbāna-dhātuya:</i> the unbinding of an arahant who has passed away. The image is of a fire that has gone so thoroughly out that its embers no longer glow. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p44">Iti 44</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_06_chakkanipata.htm#p43">AN 6:43</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p247">Thag 15:2</a>.</p>
