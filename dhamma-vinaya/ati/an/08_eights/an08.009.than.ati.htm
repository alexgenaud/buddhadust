					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's guarding of the doors of his senses:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he should look to the east, he looks focusing his entire awareness, (thinking,) 'As I am looking thus to the east, greed &amp; distress, evil unskillful qualities, will not flow out.'</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>[of hunger][from overeating] not in the Pali, and narrows the meaning destructively. There are more 'feelings' than hunger and satiation involved in over-eating, e.g., feelings concerned with survival, blame and comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nanda takes his food reflecting appropriately, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification, but simply for the survival &amp; continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, (thinking,) 'I will destroy old feelings [of hunger] &amp; not create new feelings [from overeating].</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus I will maintain myself, be blameless, &amp; live in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's devotion to wakefulness:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where Nanda during the day, sitting &amp; pacing back &amp; forth, cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">During the first watch of the night, [dusk to 10 p.m.], sitting &amp; pacing back &amp; forth, he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">During the second watch of the night, [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.], reclining on his right side, he takes up the lion's posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert, with his mind set on getting up [either as soon as he awakens or at a particular time].</p>
					
					<p class="f4">During the last watch of the night, [2 a.m. to dawn], sitting &amp; pacing back &amp; forth, he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's devotion to wakefulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's being in mindfulness &amp; alertness:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where feelings are known to Nanda as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Perceptions are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thoughts are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's being in mindfulness &amp; alertness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if Nanda did not guard the doors of his senses, know moderation in eating, be devoted to wakefulness, and be endowed with mindfulness &amp; alertness, how would he be able to follow the holy life, complete &amp; pure?"</p>
