					<p class="f4">Speaking rightly of Nanda, one could say, 'He is fiercely passionate.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If Nanda did not guard the doors of his senses, did not know moderation in eating, was not devoted to wakefulness, and was not endowed with mindfulness and alertness, how would he be able to follow the holy life, perfect and pure?</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's guarding of the doors of his senses:</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should look to the east, he looks focusing his entire awareness, (thinking,) 'As I am looking thus to the east, greed and distress, evil unskillful qualities, will not flow out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how he is alert there.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he should look to the west... the north... the south... above... below... to the intermediate directions, he looks focusing his entire awareness, (thinking,) 'As I am looking thus to the intermediate directions, greed and distress, evil unskillful qualities, will not flow out.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how he is alert there.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's guarding of the doors of his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's knowledge of moderation in eating:</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>[of hunger][from overeating] not in the Pali, and narrows the meaning destructively. There are more 'feelings' than hunger and satiation involved in over-eating, e.g., feelings concerned with survival, blame and comfort.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="f4">Nanda takes his food reflecting appropriately, not playfully, nor for intoxication, nor for putting on bulk, nor for beautification, but simply for the survival and continuance of this body, for ending its afflictions, for the support of the holy life, (thinking,) 'I will destroy old feelings [of hunger] and not create new feelings [from overeating].</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus I will maintain myself, be blameless, and live in comfort.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's knowledge of moderation in eating.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's devotion to wakefulness:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where Nanda during the day, sitting and pacing back and forth, cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the first watch of the night, [dusk to 10 p.m.], sitting and pacing back and forth, he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">During the second watch of the night, [10 p.m. to 2 a.m.], reclining on his right side, he takes up the lion's posture, one foot placed on top of the other, mindful, alert, with his mind set on getting up [either as soon as he awakens or at a particular time].</p>

					<p class="f4">During the last watch of the night, [2 a.m. to dawn], sitting and pacing back and forth, he cleanses his mind of any qualities that would hold the mind in check.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's devotion to wakefulness.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is Nanda's being in mindfulness and alertness:</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where feelings are known to Nanda as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Perceptions are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thoughts are known as they arise, known as they persist, known as they subside.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is Nanda's being in mindfulness and alertness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, if Nanda did not guard the doors of his senses, know moderation in eating, be devoted to wakefulness, and be endowed with mindfulness and alertness, how would he be able to follow the holy life, complete and pure?"</p>
