					<p class="f4">Then, seated aside, Mahanama the Sakyan said thus to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mahanama, inasmuch as one<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then, venerable sir, in what way<br />
					is a lay follower virtuous?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mahanama, inasmuch as a lay follower<br />

					<p class="f4">"Then, venerable sir, in what way is a lay follower<br />
