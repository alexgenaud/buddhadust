							<p>Another explanation is that the Indriyani are impersonal forces where the balani are those forces as used by an individual (i.e., 'powers'). Consequently the balani are no longer applicable to the situation of the arahant because though the arahant does continue to experience forces he no longer has any use for them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This and the remaining strengths constitute six of the seven lists of qualities that make up the Wings to Awakening. The one missing list is the five strengths. There may be two reasons for why it is not listed here. The first, suggested by <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p163">AN 4.163</a>, is that the five strengths pertain to the lower levels of noble attainment &mdash; stream-entry through non-returning &mdash; whereas the five faculties, which cover the same qualities as the five strengths (conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, and discernment), constitute a higher intensity of these qualities pertaining exclusively to arahantship. The second possible reason is that listing the five strengths as one of eight strengths would have been confusing.</p>
