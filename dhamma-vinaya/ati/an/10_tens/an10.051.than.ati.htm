					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even if a monk is not skilled in the ways of the minds of others [not skilled in reading the minds of others], he should train himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will be skilled in reading my own mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk skilled in reading his own mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">Imagine a young woman—or man—youthful, fond of adornment, examining the image of her own face in a bright, clean mirror or bowl of clear water: If she saw any dirt or blemish there, she would try to remove it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If she saw no dirt or blemish there, she would be pleased, her resolves fulfilled:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'How fortunate I am!</p>

					<p class="f4">How clean I am!'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk's self-examination is very productive in terms of skillful qualities (if he conducts it in this way):</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do I usually remain covetous or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">With thoughts of ill will or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Restless or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">Uncertain or gone beyond uncertainty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Angry or not?</p>

					<p class="f4">With soiled thoughts or unsoiled thoughts?</p>

					<p class="f4">With my body aroused or unaroused?</p>

					<p class="f4">Lazy or with persistence aroused?</p>

					<p class="f4">Unconcentrated or concentrated?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain covetous, with thoughts of ill will, overcome by sloth &amp; drowsiness, restless, uncertain, angry, with soiled thoughts, with my body aroused, lazy, or unconcentrated,' then he should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a person whose turban or head was on fire would put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; alertness to put out the fire on his turban or head; in the same way, the monk should put forth extra desire, effort, diligence, endeavor, relentlessness, mindfulness, &amp; alertness for the abandoning of those very same evil, unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if, on examination, a monk knows, 'I usually remain uncovetous, without thoughts of ill will, free of sloth &amp; drowsiness, not restless, gone beyond uncertainty, not angry, with unsoiled thoughts, with my body unaroused, with persistence aroused, &amp; concentrated,' then his duty is to make an effort in maintaining those very same skillful qualities to a higher degree for the ending of the effluents."</p>
