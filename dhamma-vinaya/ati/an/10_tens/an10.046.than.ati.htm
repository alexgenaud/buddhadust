					<p class="f4">Then many Sakyan lay followers, it being the uposatha day, went to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to him, they sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, the Blessed One said to them, "Sakyans, do you observe the eight-factored uposatha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sometimes we do, lord, and sometimes we don't."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's no gain for you, Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's ill-gotten, that in this life so endangered by grief, in this life so endangered by death, you sometimes observe the eight-factored uposatha and sometimes don't.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sakyans?</p>

					<p class="f4">Suppose a man, by some profession or other, without encountering an unskillful day, were to earn a half-kahāpaṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he deserve to be called a capable man, full of initiative?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man, by some profession or other, without encountering an unskillful day, were to earn a kahāpaṇa...</p>

					<p class="f4">two kahāpaṇas...</p>

					<p class="f4">three...</p>

					<p class="f4">four...</p>

					<p class="f4">five...</p>

					<p class="f4">six...</p>

					<p class="f4">seven...</p>

					<p class="f4">eight...</p>

					<p class="f4">nine...</p>

					<p class="f4">ten...</p>

					<p class="f4">twenty...</p>

					<p class="f4">thirty...</p>

					<p class="f4">forty...</p>

					<p class="f4">fifty...</p>

					<p class="f4">one hundred kahāpaṇas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he deserve to be called a capable man, full of initiative?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Earning one hundred, one thousand kahāpaṇas a day; saving up his gains, living for one hundred years, would a man arrive at a great mass of wealth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man, because of that wealth, on account of that wealth, with that wealth as the cause, live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a day, a night, half a day, or half a night?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">And why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensual pleasures are inconstant, hollow, false, deceptive by nature."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, Sakyans, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten years—heedful, ardent, and resolute—practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millennia.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let alone ten years, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending nine years...</p>

					<p class="f4">eight years...</p>

					<p class="f4">seven...</p>

					<p class="f4">six...</p>

					<p class="f4">five...</p>

					<p class="f4">four...</p>

					<p class="f4">three...</p>

					<p class="f4">two years...</p>

					<p class="f4">one year—heedful, ardent, and resolute—practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millennia.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let alone one year, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten months...</p>

					<p class="f4">nine months...</p>

					<p class="f4">eight months...</p>

					<p class="f4">seven...</p>

					<p class="f4">six...</p>

					<p class="f4">five...</p>

					<p class="f4">four...</p>

					<p class="f4">three...</p>

					<p class="f4">two months...</p>

					<p class="f4">one month...</p>

					<p class="f4">half a month—heedful, ardent, and resolute—practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millennia.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Let alone half a month, there is the case where a disciple of mine, spending ten days and nights...</p>

					<p class="f4">nine days and nights...</p>

					<p class="f4">eight...</p>

					<p class="f4">seven...</p>

					<p class="f4">six...</p>

					<p class="f4">five...</p>

					<p class="f4">four...</p>

					<p class="f4">three...</p>

					<p class="f4">two days and nights...</p>

					<p class="f4">one day and night—heedful, ardent, and resolute—practicing as I have instructed, would live sensitive to unalloyed bliss for a hundred years, a hundred centuries, a hundred millennia.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he would be a once-returner, a non-returner, or at the very least a stream-winner.</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's no gain for you, Sakyans.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's ill-gotten, that in this life so endangered by grief, in this life so endangered by death, you sometimes observe the eight-factored uposatha and sometimes don't."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then from this day forward, lord, we will observe the eight-factored uposatha."</p>
