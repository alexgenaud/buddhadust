					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "When, for a disciple of the noble ones, five forms of fear &amp; animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with the four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out the noble method, then if he wants he may state about himself:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Hell is ended for me; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; planes of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms are ended!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am a stream-winner, never again destined for the lower realms, certain, headed for self-awakening!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, which five forms of danger &amp; animosity are stilled?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When a person takes life, then with the taking of life as a requisite condition, he produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now, produces fear &amp; animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair; but when he refrains from taking life, he neither produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now nor does he produce fear &amp; animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair: For one who refrains from taking life, that fear &amp; animosity is thus stilled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When a person steals...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">engages in illicit sex...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">tells lies...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When a person drinks distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, then with the drinking of distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition, he produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now, produces fear &amp; animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair; but when he refrains from drinking distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, he neither produces fear &amp; animosity in the here &amp; now nor does he produce fear &amp; animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain &amp; despair: For one who refrains from drinking distilled &amp; fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, that fear &amp; animosity is thus stilled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the five forms of fear &amp; animosity that are stilled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And which are the four factors of stream entry with which he is endowed?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing &amp; conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas &amp; human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here &amp; now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Saṅgha:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">who have practiced straight-forwardly...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">who have practiced methodically...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four pairs, the eight individuals<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> — they are the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples: deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the four factors of stream entry with which he is endowed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out through discernment?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When this is, that is.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From the arising of this comes the arising of that.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When this isn't, that isn't.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In other words:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&amp;-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From name-&amp;-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From birth as a requisite condition, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair come into play.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now from the remainderless fading &amp; cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&amp;-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of name-&amp;-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging &amp; death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, &amp; despair all cease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress &amp; suffering.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This is the noble method that he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out through discernment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When, for a disciple of the noble ones, these five forms of fear &amp; animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with these four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly seen &amp; rightly ferreted out this noble method, then if he wants he may state about himself: 'Hell is ended for me; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; planes of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms are ended! I am a stream-winner, never again destined for the lower realms, certain, headed for self-awakening!'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The four pairs are (1) the person on the path to stream-entry, the person experiencing the fruit of stream-entry; (2) the person on the path to once-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of once-returning; (3) the person on the path to non-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of non-returning; (4) the person on the path to arahantship, the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship. The eight individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs.</p>
