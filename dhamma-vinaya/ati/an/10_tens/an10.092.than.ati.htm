					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "When, for a disciple of the noble ones, five forms of fear and animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with the four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly seen and rightly ferreted out the noble method, then if he wants he may state about himself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Hell is ended for me; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; planes of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms are ended!</p>

					<p class="f4">I am a stream-winner, never again destined for the lower realms, certain, headed for self-awakening!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, which five forms of danger and animosity are stilled?</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a person takes life, then with the taking of life as a requisite condition, he produces fear and animosity in the here and now, produces fear and animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain and despair; but when he refrains from taking life, he neither produces fear and animosity in the here and now nor does he produce fear and animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain and despair: For one who refrains from taking life, that fear and animosity is thus stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a person steals...</p>

					<p class="f4">engages in illicit sex...</p>

					<p class="f4">tells lies...</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a person drinks distilled and fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, then with the drinking of distilled and fermented drinks that cause heedlessness as a requisite condition, he produces fear and animosity in the here and now, produces fear and animosity in future lives, experiences mental concomitants of pain and despair; but when he refrains from drinking distilled and fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, he neither produces fear and animosity in the here and now nor does he produce fear and animosity in future lives, nor does he experience mental concomitants of pain and despair: For one who refrains from drinking distilled and fermented drinks that cause heedlessness, that fear and animosity is thus stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five forms of fear and animosity that are stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which are the four factors of stream entry with which he is endowed?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Saṅgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...</p>

					<p class="f4">who have practiced straight-forwardly...</p>

					<p class="f4">who have practiced methodically...</p>

					<p class="f4">who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four pairs, the eight individuals<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> — they are the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples: deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the four factors of stream entry with which he is endowed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which is the noble method that he has rightly seen and rightly ferreted out through discernment?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones notices:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this is, that is.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the arising of this comes the arising of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this isn't, that isn't.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the cessation of this comes the cessation of that.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In other words:</p>

					<p class="f4">"From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From birth as a requisite condition, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the noble method that he has rightly seen and rightly ferreted out through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When, for a disciple of the noble ones, these five forms of fear and animosity are stilled; when he is endowed with these four factors of stream entry; and when, through discernment, he has rightly seen and rightly ferreted out this noble method, then if he wants he may state about himself: 'Hell is ended for me; animal wombs are ended; the state of the hungry ghosts is ended; planes of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms are ended! I am a stream-winner, never again destined for the lower realms, certain, headed for self-awakening!'"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The four pairs are (1) the person on the path to stream-entry, the person experiencing the fruit of stream-entry; (2) the person on the path to once-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of once-returning; (3) the person on the path to non-returning, the person experiencing the fruit of non-returning; (4) the person on the path to arahantship, the person experiencing the fruit of arahantship. The eight individuals are the eight types forming these four pairs.</p>
