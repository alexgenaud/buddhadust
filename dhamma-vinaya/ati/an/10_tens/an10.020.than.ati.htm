					<p class="f4">Now there is a town of the Kurus called Kammāsadhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these ten noble dwellings in which noble ones have dwelled (in the past), dwell (in the present), and will dwell (in the future).</p>

					<p class="f4">Which ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk has abandoned five factors,<br />
					is endowed with six,<br />
					guards one,<br />
					is supported in four,<br />
					has shaken off idiosyncratic truths,<br />
					has thoroughly given up searching,<br />
					is undisturbed in his resolves,<br />
					is calmed in his bodily-fabrication,<br />
					is well released in mind,<br />
					is well released in discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten noble dwellings in which noble ones have dwelled, dwell, and will dwell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how has a monk abandoned five factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk's sensual desire is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">His ill will...</p>

					<p class="f4">His sloth and torpor...</p>

					<p class="f4">His restlessness and anxiety...</p>

					<p class="f4">His uncertainty is abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk has abandoned five factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk endowed with six (factors)?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form via the eye, is not gladdened, not saddened, but remains equanimous, mindful, and alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">On hearing a sound via the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">On smelling an aroma via the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">On tasting a flavor via the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">On touching a tactile sensation via the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">On cognizing an idea via the intellect, he is not gladdened, not saddened, but remains equanimous, mindful, and alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is endowed with six (factors).</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk guard one (factor)?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is endowed with an awareness guarded by mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk guards one (factor).</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk supported in four (ways)?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, carefully reflecting, follows one thing, tolerates another, avoids another, and destroys another.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is supported in four (ways).<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And how has a monk shaken off idiosyncratic truths <i>[pacceka-sacca]?</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk has shaken off the run-of-the-mill idiosyncratic truths of run-of-the-mill contemplatives and brahmans—in other words,</p>

					<p class="f4">'The cosmos is eternal,'<br />
					'The cosmos is not eternal,'<br />
					'The cosmos is finite,'<br />
					'The cosmos is infinite,'<br />
					'The soul and the body are the same,'<br />
					'The soul is one thing and the body another,'<br />
					'After death a Tathāgata exists,'<br />
					'After death a Tathāgata does not exist,'<br />
					'After death a Tathāgata both does and does not exist,'<br />
					'After death a Tathāgata neither does nor does not exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">All of these he has thrown off, shaken off, renounced, vomited up, let go, abandoned, relinquished.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk has shaken off idiosyncratic truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how has a monk thoroughly given up searching?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk has abandoned his search for sensuality...</p>

					<p class="f4">his search for becoming...</p>

					<p class="f4">his search for a holy life.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> This is how a monk has thoroughly given up searching.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk undisturbed in his resolves?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk has abandoned his resolve for sensuality...</p>

					<p class="f4">his resolve for ill-will...</p>

					<p class="f4">his resolve for harmfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is undisturbed in his resolves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk calmed in his bodily fabrication?<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress—enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is calmed in his bodily fabrication.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk well released in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk's mind is released from passion, released from aversion, released from delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is well released in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk well released in discernment?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk discerns, 'Passion is abandoned in me, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, 'Aversion is abandoned in me, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, 'Delusion is abandoned in me, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is well released in discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, all those in the past who have dwelled in noble dwellings have dwelled in these same ten noble dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those in the future who will dwell in noble dwellings will dwell in these same ten noble dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those in the present who dwell in noble dwellings dwell in these same ten noble dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the ten noble dwellings in which noble ones have dwelled, dwell, and will dwell."</p>
