					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Sāvatthi at Jetavana at the monastery of Anāthapiṇḍika.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable Sir," they said by way of reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One then spoke as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These ten essentials <i>(dhammas)</i><br />
					must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth (to live the holy life).</p>

					<p class="f4">What are these ten?</p>

					<p class="f4">1. "'I am now changed into a different mode of life (from that of a layman).'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. "'My life depends on others.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. "'I must now behave in a different manner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. "'Does my mind upbraid me<br />
					regarding the state of my virtue (sila)?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. "'Do my discerning fellow-monks<br />
					having tested me,<br />
					reproach me regarding the state of my virtue?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "'There will be a parting (some day)<br />
					from all those who are dear and loving to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Death brings this separation to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "'Of <i>kamma</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> I am constituted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Kamma is my inheritance;<br />
					kamma is the matrix;<br />
					kamma is my kinsman;<br />
					kamma is my refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever kamma I perform,<br />
					be it good or bad,<br />
					to that I shall be heir.</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "'How do I spend my nights and days?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "'Do I take delight in solitude?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. "'Have I gained superhuman faculties?</p>

					<p class="f4">Have I gained that higher wisdom<br />
					so that when I am questioned (on this point) by fellow-monks<br />
					at the last moment (when death is approaching)<br />
					I will have no occasion<br />
					to be depressed and downcast?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This must be reflected upon again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are the essentials<br />
					that should be reflected again and again<br />
					by one who has gone forth (to live the holy life)."</p>

					<p class="f4">So spoke the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those monks rejoiced at the words of the Blessed One.</p>
