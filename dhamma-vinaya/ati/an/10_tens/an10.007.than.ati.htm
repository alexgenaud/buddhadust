Ānanda went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sāriputta, "Friend Sāriputta, could a monk have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth, nor of water with regard to water, nor of fire...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">wind...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the dimension of the infinitude of space...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the dimension of nothingness...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">this world...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet he would still be percipient?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend Ānanda, he could...."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But how, friend Sāriputta, could a monk have an attainment of concentration such that he would neither be percipient of earth with regard to earth...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet he would still be percipient?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Once, friend Ānanda, when I was staying right here near Sāvatthī in the Grove of the Blind, I reached concentration in such a way that I was neither percipient of earth with regard to earth...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">nor of the next world with regard to the next world, and yet I was still percipient."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But what, friend Sāriputta, were you percipient of at that time?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'The cessation of becoming — unbinding — the cessation of becoming — unbinding':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One perception arose in me, friend Ānanda, as another perception ceased.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as in a blazing woodchip fire, one flame arises as another flame ceases, even so, 'The cessation of becoming — unbinding — the cessation of becoming — unbinding':</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One perception arose in me as another one ceased.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I was percipient at that time of 'The cessation of becoming — unbinding.'"</p>
