					<p class="f4">Which ten?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk is virtuous. He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior &amp; sphere of activity. He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monk has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what he has heard. Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that — in their meaning and expression — proclaim the holy life that is entirely perfect, surpassingly pure:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, accumulated, examined with his mind, &amp; well-penetrated in terms of his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monk is adept at the various affairs involving his companions in the holy life; is vigorous, quick-witted in the techniques involved in them, is up to doing them or arranging to get them done.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And the fact that he is adept at... doing them or arranging to get them done is a quality creating a protector.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then again, the monk is one who desires the Dhamma, endearing in his conversation, greatly rejoicing in the higher Dhamma &amp; higher Vinaya.</p>
