					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindfulness of death,<br />
					when developed and pursued,<br />
					is of great fruit and great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">It gains a footing in the deathless,<br />

					<p class="f4">Therefore you should develop<br />

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					a certain monk addressed the Blessed One,<br />
					"I already develop mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how do you develop mindfulness of death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I think, 'O, that I might live for a day and night,<br />
					that I might attend to the Blessed One's instructions.</p>

					<p class="f4">I would have accomplished a great deal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how I develop mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I, too, already develop mindfulness of death."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how do you develop mindfulness of death?"</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"But whoever develops mindfulness of death, thinking, 'O, that I might live for the interval<br />

					<p class="f4">they are said to dwell heedfully.</p>

					<p class="f4">They develop mindfulness of death acutely<br />
					for the sake of ending the effluents.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore you should train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will dwell heedfully.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will develop mindfulness of death acutely<br />
					for the sake of ending the effluents.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you should train yourselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
