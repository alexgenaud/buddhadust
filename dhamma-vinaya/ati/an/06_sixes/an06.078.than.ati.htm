					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The unafflicted, <i>abyāpajjha,</i> is an epithet for unbinding. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm">SN 43</a>. Given that this sutta discusses the types of delight that get one started on the path, it would seem that to delight in the unafflicted would mean to delight in the prospect of attaining an unafflicted state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> "Objectification" is a translation of <i>papañca.</i> Although in some circles <i>papañca</i> has come to mean a proliferation of thinking, in the Canon it refers not to the amount of thinking, but to a type of thinking marked by the classifications and perceptions it uses. As <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#IV.14">Sn 4:14</a> points out, the root of these classifications and perceptions is the thought, "I am the thinker." From this assumption grow such classifications as "me/not me," "existing/not existing," which frame experience in terms conducive to further becoming. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p18">MN 18</a> discuss the relationship between objectification and conflict. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p173">AN 4:173</a> states that the range of objectification is identical with the range of the six sense media. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_43_asankhatasamyutta.htm">SN 43</a> lists non-objectification, <i>nippapañca,</i> as one of many epithets for unbinding.</p>
