					<p class="f4">And on that occasion<br />
					the lay woman Veḷukaṇḍakī, Nanda's mother,<br />
					had established a donation endowed with six factors<br />
					for the community of monks headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw with his divine eye,<br />
					surpassing the human,<br />
					that the laywoman Veḷukaṇḍakī, Nanda's mother,<br />
					had established a donation endowed with six factors<br />
					for the community of monks headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.<br />
					On seeing this, he addressed the monks:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Monks, the lay woman Veḷukaṇḍakī, Nanda's mother,<br />
					has established a donation endowed with six factors<br />
					for the community of monks headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a donation endowed with six factors?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where there are<br />
					the three factors of the donor,<br />
					the three factors of the recipients.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which are the three factors of the donor?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where the donor,<br />
					before giving, is glad;<br />
					while giving, his/her mind is bright and clear;<br />
					and after giving is gratified.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three factors of the donor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which are the three factors of the recipients?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where<br />
					the recipients are free of passion or<br />
					are practicing for the subduing of passion;<br />
					free of aversion or<br />
					practicing for the subduing of aversion; and<br />
					free of delusion or<br />
					practicing for the subduing of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three factors of the recipients.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Such are the three factors of the donor,<br />
					the three factors of the recipients.</p>

					<p class="f4">And this is how a donation is endowed with six factors.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And it is not easy to take the measure of the merit<br />
					of a donation thus endowed with six factors as<br />
					'just this much a bonanza of merit,<br />
					a bonanza of what is skillful<br />
					— a nutriment of bliss, heavenly, resulting in bliss, leading to heaven —<br />
					that leads to what is desirable, pleasing, charming, beneficial, pleasant.'|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit,<br />
					incalculable, immeasurable.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as it is not easy to take the measure<br />
					of the great ocean as<br />
					'just this many buckets of water,<br />
					just this many hundreds of buckets of water,<br />
					just this many thousands of buckets of water,<br />
					or just this many hundreds of thousands of buckets of water.'|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is simply reckoned as a great mass of water,<br />
					incalculable, immeasurable.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					it is not easy to take the measure of the merit<br />
					of a donation thus endowed with six factors as<br />
					'just this much a bonanza of merit,<br />
					a bonanza of what is skillful<br />
					— a nutriment of bliss, heavenly, resulting in bliss, leading to heaven —<br />
					that leads to what is desirable, pleasing, charming, beneficial, pleasant.'|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is simply reckoned as a great mass of merit, incalculable, immeasurable."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Before giving, glad;<br />
							while giving, the mind is bright and clear;<br />
							having given, one is gratified:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the consummation of the sacrifice.<br />
							Free of passion, free of aversion,<br />
							free of delusion, without effluent:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;the consummation of the field of the sacrifice,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;one restrained, leading the holy life.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							Having rinsed oneself,<br />
							having given with one's own hands,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;then — because of oneself,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;because of the other — <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							that is a sacrifice yielding great fruit.<br />
							Having given thus<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;— intelligent —<br />
							a person of conviction,<br />
							with awareness released,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;reappears<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;— wise —<br />
							in a world of bliss<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;unalloyed.</p>
