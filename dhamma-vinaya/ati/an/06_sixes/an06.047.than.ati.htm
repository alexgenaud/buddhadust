					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'The Dhamma is visible here-and-now, the Dhamma is visible here-and-now,' it is said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To what extent is the Dhamma visible here-and-now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, then, Sivaka, I will ask you a question in return.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When greed is present within you, do you discern that 'Greed is present within me'?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when greed is not present within you, do you discern that 'Greed is not present within me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The fact that when greed is present within you, you discern that greed is present within you; and when greed is not present within you, you discern that greed is not present within you: that is one way in which the Dhamma is visible in the here-and-now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When aversion is present within you...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When delusion is present within you...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When a greedy quality <i>(dhamma)</i> is present within you...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When an aversive quality is present within you...</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When a delusive quality is present within you, do you discern that 'A delusive quality is present within me'?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And when a delusive quality is not present within you, do you discern that 'A delusive quality is not present within me'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The fact that when a delusive quality is present within you, you discern that a delusive quality is present within you; and when a delusive quality is not present within you, you discern that a delusive quality is not present within you: that is one way in which the Dhamma is visible in the here-and-now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way the has Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>
