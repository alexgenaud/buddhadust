					<p class="f4">At that time, <a id="nakula">Nakula's father</a> [Nakulapitar], the householder,<br />
					was diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Nakula's mother [Nakulamatar] said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't be worried as you die, householder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Death is painful for one who is worried.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has criticized<br />

					<p class="f4">I am skilled at spinning cotton,<br />

					<p class="f4">I can support the children<br />

					<p class="f4">"Don't be worried as you die, householder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Death is painful for one who is worried.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has criticized<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now it may be<br />
					that you are thinking,<br />
					'Nakula's mother will take another husband<br />
					after I'm gone,'<br />
					but you shouldn't see things in that way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You know as well as I<br />
					how my fidelity [literally: householder-celibacy] has been constant for the past sixteen years.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't be worried as you die, householder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Death is painful for one who is worried.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has criticized<br />

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now it may be<br />

					'Nakula's mother will have no desire<br />

					to go see the Saŋgha of monks,<br />
					after I'm gone,'<br />

					<p class="f4">I will have an even greater desire<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now it may be<br />

					<p class="f4">To the extent that the Blessed One has white-clad householder female disciples<br />

					I am one of them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If anyone doubts or denies this,<br />

					near Crocodile Haunt.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So don't be worried as you die, householder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Death is painful for one who is worried.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Blessed One has criticized<br />
					being worried at the time of death.</p>

					<p class="f4">While Nakula's father the householder<br />
					was being exhorted by Nakula's mother<br />
					with this exhortation,<br />
					his disease was immediately allayed.<br />

					<p class="f4">That was how Nakula's father's disease<br />

					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One,<br />

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there,<br />
