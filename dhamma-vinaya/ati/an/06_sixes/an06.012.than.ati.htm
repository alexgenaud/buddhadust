					<p class="f4">Which six?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where a monk is set on bodily acts of good will<br />
					with regard to his fellows in the holy life,<br />
					to their faces<br />
					and behind their backs.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a condition that is conducive to amiability,<br />

					<p class="f4">This, too, is a condition that is conducive to amiability,<br />

					<p class="f4">He consumes them<br />

					<p class="f4">This, too, is a condition that is conducive to amiability,<br />
