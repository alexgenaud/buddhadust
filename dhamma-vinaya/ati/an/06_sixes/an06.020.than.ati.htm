					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, mindfulness of death<br />
					— when developed and pursued —<br />
					is of great fruit and great benefit.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It gains a footing in the deathless,<br />
					has the Deathless as its final end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is mindfulness of death developed and pursued<br />
					so that it is of great fruit and great benefit,<br />
					gains a footing in the deathless,<br />
					and has the Deathless as its final end?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk,<br />
					as day departs and night returns, reflects:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Many are the [possible] causes of my death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A snake might bite me,<br />
					a scorpion might sting me,<br />
					a centipede might bite me.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Stumbling, I might fall;<br />
					my food, digested, might trouble me;<br />
					my bile might be provoked,<br />
					my phlegm might be provoked,<br />
					piercing wind forces (in the body) might be provoked.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk should investigate:|| ||</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Are there any evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities<br />
					unabandoned by me<br />
					that would be an obstruction for me<br />
					were I to die in the night?'</p>

					<p class="f4">If, on reflecting, he realizes<br />
					that there are evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities<br />
					unabandoned by him<br />
					that would be an obstruction for him<br />
					were he to die in the night,<br />
					then he should put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />
					endeavor,<br />
					relentlessness,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					and alertness for the abandoning<br />
					of those very same evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="turban1">Just as when</a> a person<br />
					whose turban or head was on fire<br />
					would put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />
					endeavor,<br />
					relentlessness,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					and alertness to put out the fire<br />
					on his turban or head,<br />
					in the same way<br />
					the monk should put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />
					endeavor,<br />
					relentlessness,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					and alertness for the abandoning<br />
					of those very same evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if, on reflecting, he realizes<br />
					that there are no evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities<br />
					unabandoned by him<br />
					that would be an obstruction for him<br />
					were he to die in the night,<br />
					then for that very reason<br />
					he should dwell in joy and rapture,<br />
					training himself day and night<br />
					in skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, there is the case where a monk,<br />
					as night departs and day returns, reflects:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Many are the [possible] causes of my death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">A snake might bite me,<br />

					<p class="f4"> 'Are there any evil,<br />

					<p class="f4">If, on reflecting, he realizes<br />
					that there are evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities<br />
					unabandoned by him<br />
					that would be an obstruction for him<br />

					then he should put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />
					endeavor,<br />
					relentlessness,<br />
					mindfulness,<br />
					and alertness for the abandoning<br />
					of those very same evil,<br />
					unskillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="turban2">Just as when</a> a person<br />
					whose turban or head was on fire<br />
					would put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />
					endeavor,<br />
					undivided mindfulness,<br />
					and alertness to put out the fire<br />
					on his turban or head,<br />
					in the same way the monk<br />
					should put forth extra desire,<br />
					effort,<br />
					diligence,<br />

					<p class="f4">"This, monks, is how mindfulness of death<br />
					is developed and pursued<br />
					so that it is of great fruit and great benefit,<br />
					plunges into the Deathless,<br />
					and has the Deathless<br />
					as its final end."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
