					<p class="f4">And I can imagine no one other bond<br />

					<p class="f4 in2">Poverty is called<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffering in the world;<br />
					so, too, is getting into debt.<br />
					A poor person, in debt,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partaking of sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; suffers hardship.<br />
					Then they hound him<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and put him into bondage:<br />
					the painful bond<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for one longing to gain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Now, anyone with no conviction<br />
					in the discipline of the noble ones<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — no sense of shame,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no sense of compunction — <br />
					contemplating evil actions,<br />
					doing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong by way of body,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wrong by way of speech,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and wrong by way of the mind,<br />
					wants: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'May they not<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know about me.'<br />
					He creeps along in body,<br />
					speech, or mind,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piling up evil actions,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here and there,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; again and again.<br />
					He,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with evil actions,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his wisdom weak,<br />
					knowing his own wrong-doing, is<br />
					a poor person, in debt.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Partaking of sensuality,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he suffers hardship.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Then they hound him — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; painful mental resolves<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; born of remorse — <br />
					at home or in the wilderness.<br />
					He,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with evil actions,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his wisdom weak,<br />
					knowing his own wrong-doing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; goes to an animal womb<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or is bound in hell:<br />
					the painful bond<br />
					from which the enlightened<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are freed.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">But one with confidence,<br />
					living at home,<br />
					making gifts of his belongings,<br />
					righteously-gained,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wins both goals:<br />
					advantage in the here-and-now,<br />
					and happiness in the world beyond.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The liberality of this householder<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; piles up merit.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Now, anyone with conviction<br />
					firmly established<br />
					in the discipline of a noble one — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a sense of shame,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a sense of compunction,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; discerning<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and restrained by virtue — <br />
					is, in the discipline of a noble one,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said to be living in ease.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Gaining a pleasure not of the flesh,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he determines on equanimity:<br />
					abandoning the five hindrances<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — persistence constantly aroused — <br />
					entering the jhānas:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unified,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful, and<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; astute.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing this<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as it has come to be<br />
					in the total ending of all fetters,<br />
					through everywhere<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not-clinging,<br />
					his mind is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rightly released.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">In him, Such, rightly released,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there is the knowledge,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the total ending<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the fetters of becoming:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'My release<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is unprovoked.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">That &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the highest knowledge<br />

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dustless,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at rest,<br />
