					<p class="f4">And on that occasion a large number of elder monks, after the meal, on returning from their alms round, were sitting gathered together in the assembly hall when this discussion arose:</p>

					<p class="f4">"It was said by the Blessed One in The Way to the Further Shore, in Metteyya's Question [<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp52">Sn 5:2</a>]:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Whoever, a thinker,<br />

					<p class="f4">Which is the second side?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is in-between?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who is the seamstress?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, a monk said to the elder monks, "Contact, friends, is the first side, the origination of contact the second side, and the cessation of contact<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, friends, that a monk directly knows what should be directly known, comprehends what should be comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing what should be directly known, comprehending what should be comprehended, he is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, another monk said to the elder monks, "The past, friends, is the first side, the future the second side, and the present is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, friends, that a monk... is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, another monk said to the elder monks, "Pleasant feeling, friends, is the first side, painful feeling the second side, and neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, friends, that a monk... is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, another monk said to the elder monks, "Name, friends, is the first side, form the second side, and consciousness is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, friends, that a monk... is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, another monk said to the elder monks, "The six internal sense-media, friends, are the first side, the six external sense-media the second side, and consciousness is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, friends, that a monk... is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, another monk said to the elder monks, "Self-identification, friends, is the first side, the origination of self-identification the second side, and the cessation of self-identification is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, one of the monks said to the elder monks, "We have each answered in line with his own inspiration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Come, friends, let's go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, report this matter to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">However he answers is how we should remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, friend," the elder monks said to that monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the elder monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they reported the entirety of their conversation to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Which of us, lord, has spoken well?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, each of you has spoken well in his way, but as for what I intended when I said in The Way to the Further Shore, in Metteyya's Question —</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Whoever, a thinker,<br />
							knowing both sides,<br />
							doesn't adhere in between: He<br />
							I call a great person. He<br />
							here has gone past<br />
							the seamstress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the elder monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Contact, monks, is the first side, the origination of contact the second side, and the cessation of contact is in between.</p>

					<p class="f4">Craving is the seamstress — for craving stitches one to the production of this or that very becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent, monks, that a monk directly knows what should be directly known, comprehends what should be comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Directly knowing what should be directly known, comprehending what should be comprehended, he is one who puts an end to suffering and stress in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The version of this verse in the Thai edition of this discourse reads:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in4"><i>Yo ubh'ante viditvāna&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;majjhe mantā na limpati</i><br />

               <p class="lgqt">In the Thai edition of <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp56">Sn 5:2</a>, however, the verse is slightly different:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in4"><i>So ubh'antam-abhiññāya&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;majjhe mantā na limpati</i><br />
							<i>Taṁ brūmi mahāpurisoti&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;so'dha sibbanim-accagāti.</i></p>

               <p class="lgqt">This would translate as:</p>
