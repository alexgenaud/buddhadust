					<p class="f4">And at that time Ven. Khema and Ven. Sumana were staying near Sāvatthi in the Grove of the Blind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Khema and Ven. Sumana went to the Blessed One and on arrival, have bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Khema said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk is an arahant, with his effluents ended — one who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and is released through right gnosis — the thought doesn't occur to him that</p>

					'There is someone equal to me,' or<br />
					'There is someone worse than me.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ven. Khema said, and the Teacher approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing that "The Teacher approves of me," Ven. Khema got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circled him — keeping him on his right — and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sumana, not long after Ven.

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this is how clansmen declare gnosis.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meaning [of gnosis] is stated, but without mention of self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet there are some worthless people who declare gnosis as if in jest.</p>
