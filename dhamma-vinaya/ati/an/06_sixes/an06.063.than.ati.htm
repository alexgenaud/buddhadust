					<p class="f4">"And what is the diversity in kamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is kamma to be experienced in hell,<br />
					kamma to be experienced in the realm of common animals,<br />
					kamma to be experienced in the realm of the hungry shades,<br />
					kamma to be experienced in the human world,<br />
					kamma to be experienced in the world of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the diversity in kamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the result of kamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">The result of kamma is of three sorts, I tell you:<br />
					that which arises right here and now,<br />
					that which arises later [in this lifetime],<br />
					and that which arises following that.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the result of kamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the cessation of kamma?</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact<br />
					is the cessation of kamma;<br />
					and just this noble eightfold path<br />
					— right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration —<br />
					is the path of practice<br />
					leading to the cessation of kamma.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now when a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					discerns kamma in this way,<br />
					the cause by which kamma comes into play in this way,<br />
					the diversity of kamma in this way,<br />
					the result of kamma in this way,<br />
					the cessation of kamma in this way,<br />
