					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning the Blessed One adjusted his under robe and—carrying his bowl &amp; robes—went into Sāvatthī for alms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed Ven. Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra's mother, for the day's abiding."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Ānanda responded to the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One together with Ven. Ānanda went to the Eastern Monastery, the palace of Migāra's mother.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On emerging from his seclusion in the late afternoon, he addressed Ven. Ānanda, "Come, Ānanda, let's go to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe our limbs."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Ānanda responded to the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One together with Ven. Ānanda went to the Eastern Gatehouse to bathe his limbs.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having bathed his limbs near the Eastern Gatehouse and gotten out of the water, he stood wearing only his lower robe, letting his limbs dry.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then King Pasenadi Kosala's nāga elephant named Seta came out of the Eastern Gatehouse accompanied by a great noise of instruments &amp; drums.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">People, on seeing him, said, "How beautiful is the king's nāga!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How lovely the king's nāga!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How inspiring the king's nāga!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How blessed with a body the king's nāga!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Udāyin said to the Blessed One, "Lord, is it only on seeing an elephant blessed with a large, massive body that people say, 'A nāga! What a nāga!'?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or is there anything else blessed with a large, massive body that people, on seeing it, say, 'A nāga! What a nāga!'?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Udāyin, it's on seeing an elephant blessed with a large, massive body that that people say, 'A nāga! What a nāga!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It's on seeing a horse blessed with a large, massive body, a bull blessed with a large, massive body, a serpent blessed with a large, massive body, a tree blessed with a large, massive body, a human being blessed with a large, massive body that people say, 'A nāga! What a nāga!'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But, Udāyin, whoever in this world—with its devas, Māras, &amp; Brahmās, its people with their contemplatives &amp; brahmans, their royalty &amp; commonfolk—does no misdeed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> in body, speech, or mind: That's whom I call a nāga."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Amazing, lord! Astounding!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">How that was well-said by the Blessed One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'But, Udāyin, whoever in this world—with its devas, Māras, &amp; Brahmās, its people with their contemplatives &amp; brahmans, their royalty &amp; commonfolk—does no misdeed in body, speech, or mind: That's whom I call a nāga.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And I will rejoice, lord, in what was well-said by the Blessed One with these verses:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">A human being, self-awakened,<br />
							his mind tamed, concentrated,<br />
							traveling along the Brahmā road,<br />
							delighting in the stilling of the mind:<br />
							He, having gone beyond all dhammas,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							to whom human beings pay homage,<br />

							delighting in the renunciation of sensuality,<br />
							released like gold from its ore.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">He, the nāga outshining all others,<br />
							as the Himalayas, rocky hills:<br />
							Among all things named 'nāga,'<br />
							he, unexcelled, is truly named.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">I will praise the nāga to you—<br />

							Composure &amp; harmlessness<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">discrimination,</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">reflection on dhammas;<br />

							He, in jhāna, delighting in assurance,<br />

							the nāga, when going, is concentrated,<br />
							when standing, the nāga is concentrated,<br />
							when reclining, the nāga is concentrated,<br />
							when sitting, the nāga is concentrated.<br />
							Everywhere he's restrained, the nāga:<br />
							That is the nāga's consummation.<br />
							He eats what is blameless;<br />
							doesn't eat what is not;<br />
							on gaining food &amp; clothing,<br />
							doesn't store it up.<br />
							Having cut all bonds,<br />
							fetters tiny &amp; large,<br />
							wherever he goes,<br />
							he goes without longing.<br />
							Like a white lotus, born &amp; growing in the water,<br />
							but not smeared by the water</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">—fragrant, delightful—<br />
							even so the awakened one,<br />
							well-born in the world, lives in the world,<br />
							but is not smeared by the world,<br />
							like the lotus, by the water.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">A great blazing fire<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">His body discarded, the nāga<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here the Buddha is hinting at a play on words. The Pali phrase here is — āguṁ na karoti, — which could be rephrased as — na āguṁ karoti, — yielding a play on the word nāga. In his verse below, Ven. Udāyin shows that he has picked up on the hint by rephrasing it in precisely that way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> On the point that arahants have gone beyond all dhammas, see <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/ati/an/03_threes/an03.134.than.ati.htm#n1">AN 3:134, note 1</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Clearing = — nibbāna, — which is here presented as a play on the word, vana, or forest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> In Pali, an elephant's trunk is called its "hand" — <i>(hattha)</i>. — In fact, one of the words for "elephant" is — <i>hatthin,</i> — "one having a hand."</p>
      
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Reading — <i>ajjhattaṁ susamāhito</i> — with the parallel verse in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p247">Thag 15:2</a>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Reading — <i>aṅgāresu ca santesu</i> — with the parallel verse in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p247">Thag 15:2</a>. The phrase is apparently meant as a play on words, in that — <i>santesu</i> — can be the locative either of — <i>santa,</i> — calm, or — sant, — existing. Either possibility fits into what seems to be point of this last section of the poem, which is to provide an image to illustrate the difference between the — <i>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</i> — of the living arahant—literally, unbinding with fuel remaining—and the — <i>anupādisesa-nibbāna</i> — of the arahant who has passed away—literally, unbinding with no fuel remaining. In other words, the unbinding of the living arahant is like a fire that has grown calm and whose embers are calm but still warm; the unbinding of the arahant after death is like a fire whose embers have grown totally cold.</p>

							<p class="lgqt in2"><a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p44">Iti 44</a> describes the property of — <i>sa-upādisesa-nibbāna</i> — as follows: "His [the arahant's] five sense faculties still remain and, owing to their being intact, he experiences the pleasing &amp; the displeasing, and is sensitive to pleasure &amp; pain. His ending of passion, aversion, &amp; delusion is termed the unbinding property with fuel remaining." Its description of the property of — <i>anupādisesa-nibbāna</i> — is: "For him, all that is sensed, being unrelished, will grow cold right here. This is termed the unbinding property with no fuel remaining." For further discussion of this distinction, see — <i>The Mind Like Fire Unbound,</i> — chapter 1.</p>
