					<p class="f4">On arrival, having bowed down to him,<br />

					<p class="f4">As she was standing there,<br />
					she said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven qualities, lord,<br />

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Respect for the teacher,<br />

					<p class="f4">That is what the devatā said.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Teacher approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing, "The Teacher approves of me,"<br />
					the devatā bowed down to the Blessed One and,<br />
					circled him three times,<br />
					keeping him to his right,<br />
					and then disappeared right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then when the night had past,<br />
					The Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Last night, monks,<br />
					a certain devatā in the far extreme of the night,<br />
					her extreme radiance lighting up the entirety of Jeta's Grove,<br />
					came to me and, on arrival,<br />
					bowed down to me and stood to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As she was standing there,<br />
					she said to me,</p>

					<p class="f4">'These seven qualities, lord,<br />
					lead to a monk's non-decline.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Respect for the teacher,<br />
					respect for the Dhamma,<br />
					respect for the Saŋgha,<br />
					respect for training,<br />
					respect for concentration,<br />
					respect for heedfulness,<br />
					respect for hospitality.</p>

					<p class="f4">These seven qualities, lord,<br />
					lead to the non-decline of a monk.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is what that devatā said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said it,<br />
					she bowed down to me,<br />
					circled me three times,<br />
					and then disappeared right there."</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Respecting the Teacher<br />
							respecting the Dhamma,<br />
							and with fierce respect for the Saŋgha,<br />
							respecting concentration, ardent,<br />
							and with fierce respect for training,<br />
							a monk respecting heedfulness,<br />
							and with respect for hospitality<br />
							— incapable of decline —<br />
							is right in the presence of unbinding.|| ||</p>
