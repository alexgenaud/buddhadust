					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">The treasure of conviction,<br />
					the treasure of virtue,<br />
					the treasure of sense of shame,<br />
					the treasure of a sense of compunction,<br />
					the treasure of listening,<br />
					the treasure of generosity,<br />
					the treasure of discernment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="saddha">treasure of conviction</a>?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					has conviction,<br />
					is convinced of the Tathāgata's Awakening:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy<br />
					and rightly self-awakened,<br />
					consummate in clear-knowing and conduct,<br />
					well-gone,<br />
					an expert with regard to the cosmos,<br />
					unexcelled as a trainer<br />
					of those people fit to be tamed,<br />
					the Teacher of devas and human beings,<br />
					awakened,<br />
					blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of conviction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="sila">treasure of virtue</a>?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					abstains from taking life,<br />
					abstains from stealing,<br />
					abstains from sexual misconduct,<br />
					abstains from lying,<br />
					abstains from taking intoxicants<br />
					that cause heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the treasure of virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="hiri">treasure of a sense of shame?</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					feels shame<br />
					at [the thought of engaging in] bodily misconduct,<br />
					verbal misconduct,<br />
					mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of a sense of shame.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="ottappa">treasure of a sense of compunction?</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					feels compunction<br />
					at [the suffering that would result from] bodily misconduct,<br />
					verbal misconduct,<br />
					mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of a sense of compunction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the treasure of listening?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					has heard much,<br />
					has retained what he/she has heard,<br />
					has stored what he/she has heard.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning,<br />
					admirable in the middle,<br />
					admirable in the end,<br />
					that — in their meaning and expression —<br />
					proclaim the holy life<br />
					that is entirely perfect, surpassingly pure:<br />
					Those he/she has listened to often,<br />
					retained,<br />
					discussed,<br />
					accumulated,<br />
					examined with his/her mind,<br />
					and well-penetrated<br />
					in terms of his/her views.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of listening.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="dana">treasure of generosity?</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case of a disciple of the noble ones,<br />
					his awareness cleansed of the stain of stinginess,<br />
					living at home,<br />
					freely generous,<br />
					openhanded,<br />
					delighting in being magnanimous,<br />
					responsive to requests,<br />
					delighting in the distribution of alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of generosity.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the <a id="panna">treasure of discernment?</a></p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones<br />
					is discerning,<br />
					endowed with discernment<br />
					of arising and passing away<br />
					— noble, penetrating,<br />
					leading to the right ending of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the treasure of discernment."</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">These, monks, are the seven treasures.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">The treasure of conviction,<br />
							the treasure of virtue,<br />
							the treasure of a sense of shame &amp; compunction,<br />
							the treasure of listening, generosity,<br />
							and discernment as the seventh treasure.<br />
							Whoever, man or woman, has these treasures<br />
							is said not to be poor,<br />
							has not lived in vain.<br />
							So conviction and virtue,<br />
							faith and Dhamma-vision<br />
							should be cultivated by the wise,<br />
							remembering the Buddhas' instruction.</p>
