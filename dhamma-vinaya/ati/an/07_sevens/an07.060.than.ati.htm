					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person be ugly!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's good looks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — then even though that he may be well-bathed, well-anointed, dressed in white clothes, his hair and beard neatly trimmed, he is ugly nevertheless, all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person sleep badly!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's restful sleep.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — then even though he sleeps on a bed spread with a white blanket, spread with a woolen coverlet, spread with a flower-embroidered bedspread, covered with a rug of deerskins, with a canopy overhead, or on a sofa with red cushions at either end, he sleeps badly nevertheless, all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not profit!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's profits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — then even when he suffers a loss, he thinks, 'I've gained a profit'; and even when he gains a profit, he thinks, 'I've suffered a loss.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he has grabbed hold of these ideas that work in mutual opposition [to the truth], they lead to his long-term suffering and loss, all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any wealth!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — then whatever his wealth, earned through his efforts and enterprise, amassed through the strength of his arm, and piled up through the sweat of his brow — righteous wealth righteously gained — the king orders it sent to the royal treasury [in payment of fines levied for his behavior] all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any reputation!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's reputation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — whatever reputation he has gained from being heedful, it falls away, all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person not have any friends!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's having friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — his friends, companions, and relatives will avoid him from afar, all because he is overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the sixth thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, an enemy wishes of an enemy, 'O, may this person, on the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in the plane of deprivation, the bad bourn, the lower realms, in hell!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">An enemy is not pleased with an enemy's going to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, when a person is angry — overcome with anger, oppressed with anger — he engages in misconduct with the body, misconduct with speech, misconduct with the mind. Having engaged in misconduct with the body, misconduct with speech, misconduct with the mind, then — on the break-up of the body, after death — he reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad bourn, the lower realms, in hell, all because he was overcome with anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the seventh thing pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim, that comes to a man or woman who is angry.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the seven things — pleasing to an enemy, bringing about an enemy's aim — that come to a man or woman who is angry."</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">An angry person is ugly and sleeps poorly.<br />
					Gaining a profit, he turns it into a loss,<br />
					having done damage with word and deed.<br />
					A person overwhelmed with anger<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; destroys his wealth.<br />
					Maddened with anger,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he destroys his status.<br />
					Relatives, friends, and colleagues avoid him.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anger brings loss.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anger inflames the mind.<br />
					He doesn't realize<br />
					that his danger is born from within.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An angry person doesn't know his own benefit.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An angry person doesn't see the Dhamma.<br />
					A man conquered by anger<br />
					is in a mass of darkness.<br />
					He takes pleasure in bad deeds<br />
					as if they were good,<br />
					but later, when his anger is gone,<br />
					he suffers as if burned with fire.<br />
					He is spoiled, blotted out,<br />
					like fire enveloped in smoke.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">When anger spreads,<br />
					when a man becomes angry,<br />
					he has no shame, no compunction,<br />
					is not respectful in speech.<br />
					For a person overcome with anger,<br />
					nothing gives light.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">I'll list the deeds that bring remorse,<br />
					that are far from the teachings.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Listen!<br />
					An angry person &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kills his father,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kills his mother,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; kills Brahmans<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and people run-of-the-mill.<br />
					It's because of a mother's devotion<br />
					that one sees the world,<br />
					yet an angry run-of-the-mill person<br />
					can kill this giver of life.<br />
					Like oneself, all beings hold themselves most dear,<br />
					yet an angry person, deranged,<br />
					can kill himself in many ways:<br />
					with a sword, taking poison,<br />
					hanging himself by a rope in a mountain glen.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Doing these deeds<br />
					that kill beings and do violence to himself,<br />
					the angry person doesn't realize that he's ruined.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">This snare of Māra, in the form of anger,<br />
					dwelling in the cave of the heart:<br />
					Cut it out with self-control,<br />
					discernment, persistence, right view.<br />
					The wise man would cut out<br />
					each and every form of unskillfulness.<br />
					Train yourselves:<br />
					'May we not be blotted out.'</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Free from anger and untroubled,<br />
					free from greed, without longing,<br />
					tamed, your anger abandoned,<br />
					effluent-free, you will be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unbound.</p>
