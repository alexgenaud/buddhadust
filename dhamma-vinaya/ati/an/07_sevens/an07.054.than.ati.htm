					<p class="f4">Then General Sīha went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it possible, lord, to point out a fruit of giving visible in the here and now?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well then, Sīha, I will cross-question you on this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where there are two men: one without conviction, stingy, miserly, abusive; and one of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">To which of the two would arahants, on feeling sympathy, first show sympathy: to the man without conviction, stingy, miserly, abusive; or to the man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why, lord, would arahants, when feeling sympathy, first show sympathy to the man without conviction, stingy, miserly, abusive?</p>

					<p class="f4">The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support: He's the one to whom arahants, on feeling sympathy, would first show sympathy."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whom would arahants, when visiting, first visit...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">From whom would arahants, when receiving (gifts), first receive (gifts)...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whom would arahants, when teaching, first teach...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Of whom would a fine reputation spread abroad...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Who would approach any assembly of people — noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives — confidently and without embarrassment...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Sīha?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which of the two would — with the breakup of the body, after death — appear in a good destination, a heavenly world: the man without conviction, stingy, miserly, abusive; or the man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, why would the man without conviction, stingy, miserly, abusive — with the breakup of the body, after death — reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world?</p>

					<p class="f4">The man of conviction, a master of giving, one who delights in providing support: He's the one who would — with the breakup of the body, after death — appear in a good destination, a heavenly world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, as for the six fruits of giving visible in the here and now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One, it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I know them, too.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and arahants, when feeling sympathy, show sympathy to me first.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and arahants, when visiting, visit me first.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and arahants when receiving (gifts), receive (gifts) from me first.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and arahants when teaching, teach me first.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far and wide:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sīha is one who gives, a doer, a supporter of the Saṇgha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who gives, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of people — noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives — I do so confidently and without embarrassment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when the Blessed One says to me, 'With the breakup of the body, after death, one who gives, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, a heavenly world,' that I don't know.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Sīha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the breakup of the body, after death, one who gives, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, a heavenly world."</p>
