					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> "Anguish" here translates <em>vippaṭisāra,</em> which is usually rendered into English as "remorse" or "regret." Here, however, the feeling of <em>vippaṭisāra</em> relates to sense of compunctions about the future, rather than the past, and so neither remorse nor regret are appropriate to the context. The anguish alluded to in this passage is based either on the fear that awakening would entail an end to existence or on the contrary fear that it wouldn't.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> In some manuscripts, this paragraph runs as follows: "'The Tathāgata exists after death'—this craving-standpoint, this perception-standpoint, this product of conceiving, this product of elaboration, this clinging-standpoint: That's anguish. 'The Tathāgata doesn't exist after death' ... 'The Tathāgata both does and doesn't exist after death' ... 'The Tathāgata neither does nor doesn't exist after death'—this craving- standpoint, this perception- standpoint, this product of conceiving, this product of elaboration, this clinging- standpoint: That's anguish.</p>
