						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>Bhk. Thanissaro here changes his previous: "knows all things" to "knows every dhamma". This inserts a doubt where the simple "all things" was clear. Is this to refer to The Dhamma (caps) or 'things'? What is intended by theinstructions is 'all things'. In what way does he know 'all things'? Understanding the statement he knows of all things that they are unworthy of attachment as not being stable, as being painful because they are unstable and he can conclude, deduce infer the fact that because they are out of control in this way such things as are own-made are also not the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">Comprehending every dhamma,<br />

					he remains focused on inconstancy,<br />
					focused on dispassion,<br />

					focused on relinquishing<br />

					<p class="f4">As he remains focused on inconstancy,<br />
					focused on dispassion,<br />
					focused on cessation,<br />
					focused on relinquishing<br />

					he is unsustained by [doesn’t cling to]<br />
					anything in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unsustained, he is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Unagitated, he totally unbinds right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is in this respect, Moggallāna,<br />
