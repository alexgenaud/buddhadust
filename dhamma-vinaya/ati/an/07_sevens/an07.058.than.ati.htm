							<p>Bhk. Thanissaro here changes his previous: "knows all things" to "knows every dhamma". This inserts a doubt where the simple "all things" was clear. Is this to refer to The Dhamma (caps) or 'things'? What is intended by theinstructions is 'all things'. In what way does he know 'all things'? Understanding the statement he knows of all things that they are unworthy of attachment as not being stable, as being painful because they are unstable and he can conclude, deduce infer the fact that because they are out of control in this way such things as are own-made are also not the self.</p>
