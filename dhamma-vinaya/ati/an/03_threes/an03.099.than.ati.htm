<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 99. The Buddha illustrates the relativity of kamma using three similies. The repercussions of the same deed for one of undeveloped character and one of developed character are compared to the effects of a small amount of salt on a small amount of water and the effects of the same small amount of salt on a large body of water; and two similies comparing the punishment for a small theft committed by a poor man and the punishment for the same small theft committed by a rich and powerful man." />
