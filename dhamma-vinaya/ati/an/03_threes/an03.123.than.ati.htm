A 'lion's roar' wherein Gotama emphatically states that he has taught the Dhamma and leads the congregation well, with logical explanations, in a way that is deep and full of wonders and that the reason he has been able to do this is because he has fully understood the truth of what he is teaching." />

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And while this explanation was being given,<br />
