<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 91. The Buddha addresses the anxiousness of the bhikkhus to attain the goal by likening the training to the three basic tasks of the farmer: plowing the field, sowing the seed, and irrigation. In the same way that these three tasks are under the control of the farmer, the training is under the control of the bhikkhu; in the same way as the growth of the crop is out of the hands of the farmer; the time of attaining the goal is out of the hands of the bhikkhu. Nevertheless there is expecation of results in both cases." />

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a farming householder<br />

					Having quickly gotten his field well-plowed and well-harrowed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having quickly gotten his field well-plowed and well harrowed, he quickly plants the seed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having quickly planted the seed,<br />

					<p class="f4">'May my crops spring up today,<br />

					<p class="f4">But when the time has come,<br />
					the farming householder's crops spring up,<br />
					the grains appear,<br />
					and they ripen.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way,<br />

					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The undertaking of the training in heightened virtue,<br />
					the undertaking of the training in heightened mind,<br />
					the undertaking of the training in heightened discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three urgent duties of a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, that monk does not have the power or might [to say:]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'May my mind be released from effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance today or tomorrow or the next day.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But when the time has come,<br />
					his mind is released from effluents<br />
					through lack of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, you should train yourselves:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Strong will be our desire<br />
					for the undertaking of the training in heightened virtue.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Strong will be our desire<br />
