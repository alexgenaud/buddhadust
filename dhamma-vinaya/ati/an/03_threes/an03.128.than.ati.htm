Anuruddha went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sāriputta, "Here, by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, I see the thousand-fold cosmos.</p>

					<p class="f4">And my persistence is aroused and unsluggish.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mindfulness is established and unmuddled.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">My body is calm and unaroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind is concentrated and gathered into singleness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance."</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"My friend, when the thought occurs to you, 'By means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human, I see the thousand-fold cosmos,' that is related to your conceit.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the thought occurs to you, 'My persistence is aroused and unsluggish.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mindfulness is established and unmuddled.</p>

					<p class="f4">My body is calm and unaroused.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind is concentrated and gathered into singleness,' that is related to your restlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the thought occurs to you, 'And yet my mind is not released from the effluents through lack of clinging/sustenance,' that is related to your anxiety.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be well if — abandoning these three qualities, not attending to these three qualities — you directed your mind to the deathless property."</p>

					<p class="f4">So after that, Ven. Anuruddha — abandoning those three qualities, not attending to those three qualities — directed his mind to the deathless property.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, he in no long time entered and remained in the unexcelled goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, directly knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew, "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for the sake of this world."</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus Ven. Anuruddha became another one of the arahants.</p>
