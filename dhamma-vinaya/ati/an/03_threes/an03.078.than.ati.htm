					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there,<br />
					the Blessed One said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, every precept and practice,<br />
					every life,<br />
					every holy life that is followed<br />
					as of essential worth:<br />
					is every one of them fruitful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, that is not [to be answered]<br />
					with a categorical answer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda,<br />
					give an analytical answer."</p>

					<p class="f4">"When<br />
					— by following a life of precept and practice,<br />
					a life, a holy life<br />
					that is followed as of essential worth —<br />
					one's unskillful qualities increase<br />
					while one's skillful qualities decline:<br />
					that sort of precept and practice,<br />
					life, holy life<br />
					that is followed as of essential worth<br />
					is fruitless.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when<br />
					— by following a life of precept and practice,<br />
					a life, a holy life<br />
					that is followed as of essential worth —<br />
					one's unskillful qualities decline<br />
					while one's skillful qualities increase:<br />
					that sort of precept and practice,<br />
					life, holy life<br />
					that is followed as of essential worth<br />
					is fruitful."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ven. Ānanda said,<br />
					and the Teacher approved.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda, [realizing,]<br />
					"The Teacher approves of me,"<br />
					got up from his seat and,<br />
					having bowed down to the Blessed One<br />
					and circumambulating him,<br />
					left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then not long after Ven. Ānanda had left,<br />
					the Blessed One said to the monks,<br />
					"Monks, Ānanda is in still in training,<br />
					but it would not be easy<br />
					to find his equal in discernment."</p>
