					<p class="f4">Then two brahmans<br />
					— feeble old men, aged, advanced in years,<br />
					having come to the last stage of life,<br />
					120 years old —<br />
					went to the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On arrival, they exchanged courteous greetings with him and,<br />
					after an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there,<br />
					they said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Gotama, we are brahmans<br />
					— feeble old men, aged, advanced in years,<br />
					having come to the last stage of life,<br />
					120 years old.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And we have done no admirable deeds,<br />
					no skillful deeds,<br />
					no deeds that allay our fears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Teach us, Master Gotama.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Instruct us, Master Gotama,<br />
					for our long-term benefit and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, brahmans,<br />
					you are feeble old men, aged, advanced in years,<br />
					having come to the last stage of life,<br />
					120 years old.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And you have done no admirable deeds,<br />
					no skillful deeds,<br />
					no deeds that allay your fears.</p>

					<p class="f4">This world is on fire with aging, illness, and death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With the world thus on fire with aging, illness, and death,<br />
					any restraint of body, speech, and intellect<br />
					practiced here<br />
					will be one's shelter, cave, island,<br />
					and refuge after death<br />
					in the world beyond."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When a house is aflame,<br />
							the vessel salvaged<br />
							is the one that will be of use,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not the one left there to burn.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">So when the world is on fire<br />
							with aging and death,<br />
							you should salvage [one's wealth] by giving:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what's given is well salvaged.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When you're restrained here<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in body, speech, and awareness;<br />
							when you make merit while still alive:<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that will be for his bliss after death.</p>
