					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Greed is a cause for the origination of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aversion is a cause for the origination of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Delusion is a cause for the origination of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with greed<br />
					— born of greed, caused by greed, originating from greed:<br />
					wherever one's selfhood turns up,<br />
					there that action will ripen.<br />
					Where that action ripens,<br />
					there one will experience its fruit,<br />
					either in this very life that has arisen<br />
					or further along in the sequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with aversion<br />
					— born of aversion, caused by aversion, originating from aversion:<br />
					wherever one's selfhood turns up,<br />
					there that action will ripen.<br />
					Where that action ripens,<br />
					there one will experience its fruit,<br />
					either in this very life that has arisen<br />
					or further along in the sequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with delusion<br />
					— born of delusion, caused by delusion, originating from delusion:<br />
					wherever one's selfhood turns up,<br />
					there that action will ripen.<br />
					Where that action ripens,<br />
					there one will experience its fruit,<br />
					either in this very life that has arisen<br />
					or further along in the sequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when seeds are not broken, not rotten, not damaged by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<br />
					well-buried, planted in well-prepared soil,<br />
					and the rain-god would offer good streams of rain.<br />
					Those seeds would thus come to growth, increase, and abundance.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					any action performed with greed...<br />
					performed with aversion...<br />
					performed with delusion<br />
					— born of delusion, caused by delusion, originating from delusion:<br />
					wherever one's selfhood turns up,<br />
					there that action will ripen.<br />
					Where that action ripens,<br />
					there one will experience its fruit,<br />
					either in this very life that has arisen<br />
					or further along in the sequence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are three causes for the origination of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, these three are [further] causes for the origination of actions.<br />
					Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-greed is a cause for the origination of actions.<br />
					Non-aversion is a cause for the origination of actions.<br />
					Non-delusion is a cause for the origination of actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with non-greed<br />
					— born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, originating from non-greed:<br />
					When greed is gone,<br />
					that action is thus abandoned,<br />
					its root destroyed,<br />
					like an uprooted palm tree,<br />
					deprived of the conditions of development,<br />
					not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with non-aversion<br />
					— born of non-aversion, caused by non-aversion, originating from non-aversion:<br />
					When aversion is gone,<br />
					that action is thus abandoned,<br />
					destroyed at the root,<br />
					like an uprooted palm tree,<br />
					deprived of the conditions of development,<br />
					not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any action performed with non-delusion<br />
					— born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originating from non-delusion:<br />
					When delusion is gone,<br />
					that action is thus abandoned,<br />
					its root destroyed,<br />
					like an uprooted palm tree,<br />
					deprived of the conditions of development,<br />
					not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as when seeds are not broken, not rotten, not damaged by wind and heat,<br />
					capable of sprouting,<br />
					well-buried, planted in well-prepared soil,<br />
					and a man would burn them with fire and,<br />
					burning them with fire,<br />
					would make them into fine ashes.<br />
					Having made them into fine ashes,<br />
					he would winnow them before a high wind<br />
					or wash them away in a swift-flowing stream.<br />
					Those seeds would thus be destroyed at the root,<br />
					like an uprooted palm tree,<br />
					deprived of the conditions of development,<br />
					not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way,<br />
					any action performed with non-greed...<br />
					performed with non-aversion...<br />
					performed with non-delusion<br />
					— born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, originating from non-delusion:<br />
					When delusion is gone,<br />
					that action is thus abandoned,<br />
					its root destroyed,<br />
					like an uprooted palm tree,<br />
					deprived of the conditions of development,<br />
					not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are three causes for the origination of action."</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">A person unknowing:<br />
					the actions performed by him,<br />
					born of greed, born of aversion,<br />
					and born of delusion,<br />
					whether many or few,<br />
					are experienced right here:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no other ground is found.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">So a monk, knowing, <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sheds <br />
					greed, aversion, and delusion;<br />
					giving rise to clear knowledge, he<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sheds <br />
					all bad destinations.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> According to the Commentary, "right here" means within the stream of one's own "selfhood" <i>(attabhāva), i.e.,</i> one's own chain of rebirth. "No other ground is found" means that the fruit of the action is not experienced by any other person's chain of rebirth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Commentary notes that this verse refers to the attainment of arahantship, and that an arahant — in reaching Nibbāna — sheds not only bad destinations, but also good ones.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The word "sheds" acts as a "lamp" in this verse — it appears only once, but functions in two phrases, as I have rendered it in the translation. On the use of the lamp as a literary figure of speech, see the <a href="../../kd/dhp/dhp.intro.than.ati.htm">Introduction to <i>Dhammapada: A Translation.</i></a></p>
