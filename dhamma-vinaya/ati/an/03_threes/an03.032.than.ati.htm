<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 32. Ānanda asks the Buddha whether or not there is a state of samadhi in which there is no I-making or My-Making and yet there is liberation of the heart by wisdom. The Buddha replies that this state is attained thinking: 'This is sanity, this is the pinnacle, that is, the calming of all own-making, the forsaking of upkeep, the destruction of thirst, dispassion, ending, Nibbāna." />

Ānanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, could it be that a monk would have a concentration-attainment of such a sort that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, and that he would enter &amp; remain in the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession for one entering &amp; remaining in it?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It could be, Ānanda, that a monk would have a concentration-attainment of a such a sort...."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"But how, lord, could a monk have a concentration-attainment of such a sort...?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Ānanda, where a monk is percipient in this way:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is peace, this is exquisite — the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; unbinding.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a monk would have a concentration-attainment of a such a sort that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, and that he would enter &amp; remain in the awareness-release &amp; discernment-release in which there is no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession for one entering &amp; remaining in it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And it was in reference to this that I said, in Puṇṇaka's Questions in the Pārāyana [<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp57">Sn 5:3</a>]:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">He who has fathomed<br />
