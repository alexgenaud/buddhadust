<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 32. Ānanda asks the Buddha whether or not there is a state of samadhi in which there is no I-making or My-Making and yet there is liberation of the heart by wisdom. The Buddha replies that this state is attained thinking: 'This is sanity, this is the pinnacle, that is, the calming of all own-making, the forsaking of upkeep, the destruction of thirst, dispassion, ending, Nibbāna." />

Ānanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, could it be that a monk would have a concentration-attainment of such a sort that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, and that he would enter and remain in the awareness-release and discernment-release in which there is no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession for one entering and remaining in it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It could be, Ānanda, that a monk would have a concentration-attainment of a such a sort...."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how, lord, could a monk have a concentration-attainment of such a sort...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, Ānanda, where a monk is percipient in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is peace, this is exquisite — the resolution of all fabrications; the relinquishment of all acquisitions; the ending of craving; dispassion; cessation; unbinding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk would have a concentration-attainment of a such a sort that, with regard to this conscious body, he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, that with regard to all external themes [topics of concentration] he would have no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession, and that he would enter and remain in the awareness-release and discernment-release in which there is no I-making or mine-making conceit-obsession for one entering and remaining in it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And it was in reference to this that I said, in Puṇṇaka's Questions in the Pārāyana [<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm#snp57">Sn 5:3</a>]:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">He who has fathomed<br />
							the high and low in the world,<br />
							for whom there is nothing<br />
							perturbing in the world —<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;evaporated,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> undesiring,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;untroubled, at peace —<br />
							he, I tell you, has crossed over birth<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;and aging.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> According to Nd II, this means that one's bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct has evaporated away, along with all one's defilements.</p>
