					<h4>The Kālāmas of Kesaputta go to see the Buddha</h4>

					<p class="f4">Once the Blessed One, while wandering in the <a id="kosala">Kosala</a> country with a large community of bhikkhus, entered a town of the <a id="kalama">Kalama</a> people called <a id="kesaputta">Kesaputta</a>.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Kālāmas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta: "Reverend Gotama, the monk, the son of the Sakyans, has, while wandering in the Kosala country, entered Kesaputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The good repute of the Reverend Gotama has been spread in this way:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Indeed, the Blessed One is thus consummate, fully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and practice, sublime, knower of the worlds, peerless, guide of tamable men, teacher of divine and human beings, which he by himself has through direct knowledge understood clearly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He set forth the Dhamma, good in the beginning, good in the middle, good in the end, possessed of meaning and the letter, and complete in everything; and he proclaims the holy life that is perfectly pure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing such consummate ones is good indeed."</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Then the Kālāmas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta went to where the Blessed One was.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On arriving there some paid homage to him and sat down on one side; some exchanged greetings with him and after the ending of cordial memorable talk, sat down on one side; some saluted him raising their joined palms and sat down on one side; some announced their name and family and sat down on one side; some without speaking, sat down on one side.</p>

					<h4>The Kālāmas of Kesaputta ask for guidance from the Buddha</h4>

					<p class="f4">3. The Kālāmas who were inhabitants of Kesaputta sitting on one side said to the Blessed One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are some monks and brahmans, venerable sir, who visit Kesaputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Some other monks and brahmans too, venerable sir, come to Kesaputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They also expound and explain only their own doctrines; the doctrines of others they despise, revile, and pull to pieces.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Venerable sir, there is doubt, there is uncertainty in us sense of compunctioning them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which of these reverend monks and brahmans spoke the truth and which falsehood?"</p>

					<h4>The criterion for rejection</h4>

					<p class="f4">4. "It is proper for you, Kālāmas, to doubt, to be uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Come, Kālāmas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing;<br />
					nor upon tradition;<br />
					nor upon rumor;<br />
					nor upon what is in a scripture;<br />
					nor upon surmise;<br />
					nor upon an axiom;<br />
					nor upon specious reasoning;<br />
					nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over;<br />
					nor upon another's seeming ability;<br />
					nor upon the consideration,<br />
					'The monk is our teacher.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Kālāmas, when you yourselves know:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'These things are bad;<br />
					these things are blamable;<br />
					these things are censured by the wise;<br />
					undertaken and observed,<br />
					these things lead to harm and ill,'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">abandon them.</p>

					<h4><a id="defilements">Greed, hate, and delusion</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">5. "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does greed appear in a man for his benefit or harm?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"For his harm, venerable sir."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Kālāmas, being given to greed, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by greed, this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies;<br />
					he prompts another too, to do likewise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Will that be long for his harm and ill?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">6. "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does hate appear in a man for his benefit or harm?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">7. "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Does delusion appear in a man for his benefit or harm?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"For his harm, venerable sir."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Kālāmas, being given to delusion, and being overwhelmed and vanquished mentally by delusion, this man takes life, steals, commits adultery, and tells lies;<br />
					he prompts another too, to do likewise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Will that be long for his harm and ill?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">8. "What do you think, Kālāmas?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Are these things good or bad?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Bad, venerable sir"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Blamable or not blamable?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Blamable, venerable sir."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Censured or praised by the wise?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Censured, venerable sir."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Undertaken and observed, do these things lead to harm and ill, or not?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Or how does it strike you?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus it strikes us here."</p>

					<p class="f4">9. "Therefore, did we say, Kālāmas, what was said thus,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Come Kālāmas:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing;<br />
					nor upon tradition;<br />

					these things lead to harm and ill,"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">abandon them.'</p>

					<h4>The criterion for acceptance</h4>

					<p class="f4">10. "Come, Kālāmas:</p>

					<h4>Absence of greed, hate, and delusion</h4>
