					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a shopkeeper has a good eye, is astute, and is consummate in his backing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a shopkeeper have a good eye?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a shopkeeper knows of an item:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This item can be bought at this price and sold at this price; the cost will be this much, and the profit this much.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a shopkeeper has a good eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a shopkeeper astute?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a shopkeeper is skilled in buying and selling an item.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a shopkeeper is astute.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a shopkeeper consummate in his backing?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where householders or householders' sons know of a shopkeeper, 'This shopkeeper has a good eye and is astute.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is capable of supporting his wife and children and repaying our investment at regular intervals.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They offer him wealth, [saying,] 'Here, my friend, having made wealth from this, support your wife and children and repay us at regular intervals.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a shopkeeper is consummate in his backing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"A shopkeeper endowed with these three factors will, in no long time, achieve greatness and abundance in terms of wealth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk endowed with three factors will, in no long time, achieve greatness and abundance in terms of skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk has a good eye, is astute, and is consummate in his backing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk have a good eye?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'This is the origination of stress'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'This is the cessation of stress'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk has a good eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk astute?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and taking on skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is astute.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk consummate in his backing?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk — approaching at regular intervals those monks who are learned, to whom the tradition has come down, who have memorized the suttas, memorized the Vinaya, memorized the mātikas [lists of Dhamma topics] — asks and questions them, 'How is this, venerable sirs?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the meaning of this?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those venerable ones make open what isn't open, make plain what isn't plain, dispel doubt on various doubtful points.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is consummate in his backing.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk endowed with these three factors will, in no long time, achieve greatness and abundance in terms of skillful qualities."</p>
