					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Āḷavī on a spread of leaves by a cattle track in a siṁsapā forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Hatthaka of Āḷavī, out roaming and rambling for exercise, saw the Blessed One sitting on a spread of leaves by the cattle track in the siṁsapā forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him, he went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, young man. I have slept in ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I am one."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But cold, lord, is the winter night.</p>

					<p class="f4">The 'Between-the-Eights'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is a time of snowfall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hard is the ground trampled by cattle hooves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thin is the spread of leaves.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sparse are the leaves in the trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thin are your ochre robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And cold blows the Verambhā wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet still the Blessed One says, 'Yes, young man. I have slept in ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Of those in the world who sleep in ease, I am one.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, young man, I will question you in return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what do you think? Suppose a householder or householder's son has a house with a gabled roof, plastered inside and out, draft-free, with close-fitting door and windows shut against the wind.</p>

					<p class="f4">Inside he has a throne-like bed spread with a long-fleeced coverlet, a white wool coverlet, an embroidered coverlet, a rug of kadali-deer hide, with a canopy above, and red cushions on either side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And there a lamp would be burning, and his four wives, with their many charms, would be attending to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Would he sleep in ease, or not? Or how does this strike you?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, he would sleep in ease. Of those in the world who sleep in ease, he would be one."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what do you think, young man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of passion so that—burned with those passion-born fevers—he would sleep miserably?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As for those passion-born fevers—burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably—that passion has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore he sleeps in ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what do you think, young man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of aversion so that—burned with those aversion-born fevers—he would sleep miserably?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As for those aversion-born fevers—burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably—that aversion has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore he sleeps in ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what do you think, young man?</p>

					<p class="f4">Might there arise in that householder or householder's son any bodily fevers or fevers of mind born of delusion so that—burned with those delusion-born fevers—he would sleep miserably?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As for those delusion-born fevers—burned with which the householder or householder's son would sleep miserably—that delusion has been abandoned by the Tathāgata, its root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore he sleeps in ease."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">"Always, always,<br />
							he sleeps in ease:<br />
							the brahman totally unbound,<br />
							who doesn't adhere<br />
							to sensual pleasures,<br />
							who's without acquisitions<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and cooled.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Having<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cut all ties<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and subdued fear in the heart,<br />
							calmed,<br />
							he sleeps in ease,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having reached peace<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of awareness."</p>
