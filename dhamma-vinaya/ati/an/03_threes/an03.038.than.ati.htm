					<h4>Translator's note:</h4>

					<p>The Pali Text Society editions treat this discourse as two discourses — III.38 and III.39 — divided at the "§". Asian editions treat it as one, numbered III.39. The autobiographical verse at the end of the second half — which is identical with the verse concluding <a href="../05_fives/an05.057.than.ati.htm">AN 5 57</a> — fits neatly with the autobiographical first half of the discourse, suggesting that the two halves were meant to go together.</p>

					<p class="f4">My father even had lotus ponds made in our palace:<br />

					one where white lotuses bloomed,<br />
					one where blue lotuses bloomed,<br />
					all for my sake.</p>

					<p class="f4">I used no sandalwood that was not from Vārāṇasī.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My turban was from Vārāṇasī,<br />

					my lower garments,<br />
					and my outer cloak.</p>

					<p class="f4">A white sunshade was held over me day and night<br />

					<p class="f4">Whereas the servants, workers, and retainers in other people's homes<br />
