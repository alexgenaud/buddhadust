Three trainings which should be eagerly taken up by the aspiring bhikkhu: the training in higher ethical practices, higher development of the heart, and higher wisdom.

					its hoof is not that of a cow,<br />
					and yet it still keeps following right after the herd of cattle, saying,<br />
					"I too am a cow! I too am a cow!"</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					there is the case where a certain monk<br />

					saying,<br />
					"I too am a monk! I too am a monk!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He doesn't have the other monks' desire<br />

					doesn't have their desire<br />

					doesn't have their desire<br />
					for undertaking the training in heightened discernment,<br />
					and yet he still keeps following right after the community of monks, saying,<br />
					"I too am a monk! I too am a monk!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"So you should train yourselves:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Strong will be our desire<br />

					strong will be our desire<br />
					for undertaking the training in heightened mind (concentration);<br />
					strong will be our desire<br />
					for undertaking the training in heightened discernment.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is how you should train yourselves."</p>
