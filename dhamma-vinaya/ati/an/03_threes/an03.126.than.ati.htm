					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/an/03_threes/an03.126.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/03_threes/an03.126.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a id="varanasi">Varanasi</a> in the Game Refuge at <a id="Isipatana">Isipatana</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning the Blessed One, having put on his robes and carrying his bowl and outer robe,<br />
					went into Varanasi for alms.<br />
					As he was walking for alms near the fig-tree at the cattle yoke,<br />
					he saw a certain monk whose delight was in what is empty,<br />
					whose delight was in exterior things,<br />
					his mindfulness muddled,<br />
					his alertness lacking,<br />
					his concentration lacking,<br />
					his mind gone astray,<br />
					his faculties uncontrolled.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him,<br />
					the Blessed One said to him:<br />
					"Monk, monk, don't let yourself putrefy!<br />
					On one who lets himself putrefy<br />
					and stink with the stench of carrion,<br />
					there's no way that flies won't swarm and attack!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monk<br />
					— admonished with this,<br />
					the Blessed One's admonishment —<br />
					came to his senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One,<br />
					having gone for alms in Varanasi,<br />
					after the meal,<br />
					returning from his alms round,<br />
					addressed the monks<br />
					[and told them what had happened].</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					a certain monk said to the Blessed One,<br />
					"What, lord, is putrefaction?<br />
					What is the stench of carrion?<br />
					What are flies?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Greed, monk, is putrefaction.<br />
					Ill will is the stench of carrion.<br />
					Evil, unskillful thoughts are flies.<br />
					On one who lets himself putrefy<br />
					and stink with the stench of carrion,<br />
					there's no way that flies won't swarm and attack.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"On one whose eyes and ears<br />
					are unguarded,<br />
					whose senses <br />
					are unrestrained,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; flies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; swarm:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resolves &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dependent on passion.<br />
					The monk who is putrid,<br />
					who stinks of the stench of carrion,<br />
					is far from Unbinding.<br />
					His share is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vexation.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Whether he stays <br />
					in village or wilderness,<br />
					having gained for himself no<br />
					tranquillity,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's surrounded by flies.<br />
					But those who are consummate <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in virtue,<br />
					who delight<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in discernment and calm,<br />
					pacified, they sleep in ease.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No flies settle on them."</p>
