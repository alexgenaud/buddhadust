					<p class="f4">Afterwards, when he leaves two qualities — greed and ill will — then, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">If the noble disciple passes away at that time, there is no fetter bound by which he would return to this world."</p>
