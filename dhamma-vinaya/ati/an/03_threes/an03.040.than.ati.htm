<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 40. The bhikkhu who has given up the household life to seek an end to pain who then indulges a variety of low thoughts is encouraged to put his better self in charge or to make himself aware that there are those in the world who can read his thoughts and by that put the world in charge, or to remind himself that the Dhamma was well taught by Gotama for just this purpose and to put the Dhamma in charge, and by one or another of these means overcome his misguided ways." />

					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The self as a governing principle, the cosmos as a governing principle, and the Dhamma as a governing principle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And what is the self as a governing principle?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It is not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it is not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of (future) becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, (and I hope,)</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, if I were to seek the same sort of sensual pleasures that I abandoned in going forth from home into homelessness — or a worse sort — that would not be fitting for me.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'My persistence will be aroused and not lax; my mindfulness established and not confused; my body calm and not aroused; my mind centered and unified.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having made himself his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is called the self as a governing principle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And what is the cosmos as a governing principle?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It's not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it's not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of (future) becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, (and I hope,)</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now if I, having gone forth, were to think thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, or thoughts of harmfulness:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Great is the community of this cosmos, and in the great community of this cosmos there are contemplatives and brahmans endowed with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled (in reading) the minds of others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They can see even from afar.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even up close, they are invisible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With their awareness they know the minds of others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would know this of me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Look, my friends, at this clansman who — though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness — remains overcome with evil, unskillful mental qualities."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are also devas endowed with psychic power, clairvoyant, skilled (in reading) the minds of others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They can see even from afar.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even up close, they are invisible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With their awareness they know the minds of others.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They would know this of me:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Look, my friends, at this clansman who — though he has in good faith gone forth from the home life into homelessness — remains overcome with evil, unskillful mental qualities."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'My persistence will be aroused and not lax; my mindfulness established and not confused; my body calm and not aroused; my mind centered and unified.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having made the cosmos his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is called the cosmos as a governing principle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And what is the Dhamma as a governing principle?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, having gone to a wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'It's not for the sake of robes that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness; it's not for the sake of almsfood, for the sake of lodgings, or for the sake of this or that state of (future) becoming that I have gone forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Simply that I am beset by birth, aging, and death; by sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs; beset by stress, overcome with stress, (and I hope,)</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Perhaps the end of this entire mass of suffering and stress might be known!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now, the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are companions in the holy life who dwell knowing and seeing it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If I — having gone forth in this well-taught Dhamma and Vinaya — were to remain lazy and heedless, that would not be fitting for me.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So he reflects on this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'My persistence will be aroused and not lax; my mindfulness established and not confused; my body calm and not aroused; my mind centered and unified.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having made the Dhamma his governing principle, he abandons what is unskillful, develops what is skillful, abandons what is blameworthy, develops what is unblameworthy, and looks after himself in a pure way.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is called the Dhamma as a governing principle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the three governing principles."</p>
