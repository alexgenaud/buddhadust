					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">Bodily purity, verbal purity, and mental purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is bodily purity?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk abstains from taking life, abstains from theft, abstains from uncelibacy.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called bodily purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is verbal purity?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk abstains from telling lies, abstains from divisive speech, abstains from harsh speech, abstains from idle chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called verbal purity.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is mental purity?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where, there being sensual desire present within, a monk discerns, 'There is sensual desire present within me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, there being no sensual desire present within, he discerns, 'There is no sensual desire present within me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns how there is the abandoning of sensual desire once it has arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of sensual desire that has been abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being ill will present within...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being sloth &amp; drowsiness present within...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being restlessness &amp; anxiety present within...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There being uncertainty present within, a monk discerns, 'There is uncertainty present within me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Or, there being no uncertainty present within, he discerns, 'There is no uncertainty present within me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns how there is the arising of unarisen uncertainty.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns how there is the abandoning of uncertainty once it has arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns how there is no further appearance in the future of uncertainty that has been abandoned.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called mental purity."</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are the three purities."</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Bodily pure, verbally pure,<br />
							mentally pure, without effluent:<br />
							A pure one, consummate in purity,<br />
							is said to be cleansed of evil.</p>
