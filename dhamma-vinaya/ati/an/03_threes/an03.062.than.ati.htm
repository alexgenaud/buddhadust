					<p class="f4">"And which is that path,<br />
					which is that practice...?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just this very noble eightfold path, i.e.,<br />
					right view,<br />
					right resolve,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>
