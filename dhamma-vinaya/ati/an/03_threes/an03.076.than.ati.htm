					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this word, 'becoming, becoming' — to what extent is there becoming?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, if there were no kamma ripening in the sensuality-property,<br />
					would sensuality-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">The consciousness of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were no kamma ripening in the form-property,<br />
					would form-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus kamma is the field,<br />
					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The consciousness of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />
					is established in/tuned to a middling property.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were no kamma ripening in the formless-property,<br />
					would formless-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus kamma is the field,<br />
					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The consciousness of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there is becoming."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Notice that the Buddha, instead of giving a definition of becoming <i>(bhāva)</i> in response to this question, simply notes that becoming occurs on three levels. Nowhere in the suttas does he define the term <i>becoming,</i> but a survey of how he uses the term in different contexts suggests that it means a sense of identity in a particular world of experience: your sense of what you are, focused on a particular desire, in your personal sense of the world as related to that desire. In other words, it is both a psychological and a cosmological concept. For more on this topic, see <a href='../../../../resources/pdf/thanissaro.bhk/paradoxofbecoming.pdf'><i>The Paradox of Becoming,</i></a> Introduction and Chapter One.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> In this analogy, "kamma" apparently means intention and the result of intention, both past and present. This would thus cover the six sense media (<a href='../../sn/04_salv/sn04.35.145.than.ati.htm'>SN 35.145</a>), the first four of the aggregates (<a href='../../sn/03_kv/sn03.22.054.than.ati.htm'>SN 22.54</a>), and the four nutriments for consciousness (<a href='../../sn/02_nv/sn02.12.064.than.ati.htm'>SN 12.64</a>). As the analogy here suggests, these elements of experience create the range of possibilities for a sense of becoming. If your past and present kamma don't contain a particular possibility, a corresponding type of becoming can't be developed. The only becomings you can experience are those from within the range of possibilities provided by your kamma. Consciousness and craving locate a particular opportunity from those possibilities that, through the nourishment of craving, they develop into an actual state of becoming. A similar analogy appears in <a href='../../sn/03_kv/sn03.22.054.than.ati.htm'>SN 22.54</a>. For more on this topic, see <a href='../../../../resources/pdf/thanissaro.bhk/paradoxofbecoming.pdf'><i>The Paradox of Becoming,</i></a> Chapter Two.</p>
