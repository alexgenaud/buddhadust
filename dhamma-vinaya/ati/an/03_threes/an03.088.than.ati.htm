					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The training in heightened virtue,<br />
					the training in heightened mind,<br />
					the training in heightened discernment.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in <a id="sila">heightened virtue</a>?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is virtuous.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He dwells restrained in accordance with the <i>Pāṭimokkha,</i><br />
					consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He trains himself,<br />
					having undertaken the training rules,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in heightened mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk<br />
					— quite secluded from sensuality,<br />
					secluded from unskillful [mental] qualities —<br />
					enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of seclusion,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the stilling of directed thought and evaluations,<br />
					he enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of concentration,<br />
					unification of awareness<br />
					free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous,<br />
					mindful and alert,<br />
					and senses pleasure with the body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasurable abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress —<br />
					he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in heightened discernment?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk discerns<br />
					as it has come to be that<br />
					'This is stress ...<br />
					This is the origination of stress ...<br />
					This is the cessation of stress ...<br />
					This is the path of practice<br />
					leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the three trainings."</p>
