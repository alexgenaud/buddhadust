					<p class="f4">"The person through whom one has gone to the Buddha for refuge, has gone to the Dhamma for refuge, has gone to the Saṅgha for refuge:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is one's great benefactor.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress':</p>

					<p class="f4">This is one's great benefactor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Further, the person through whom one — with the ending of effluents — enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized it for himself right in the here and now:</p>

					<p class="f4">This is one's great benefactor.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These three persons, monks, are one's great benefactors.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I tell you: One has no other benefactor greater than these three.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I tell you, too, that it's not easy for one to repay these three benefactors by bowing down, by rising up in greeting, by raising one's hands palm-to-palm in front of the heart, by performing services in line with seniority, or by presenting them with robes, almsfood, lodging, or medicinal requisites used for curing the sick."</p>
