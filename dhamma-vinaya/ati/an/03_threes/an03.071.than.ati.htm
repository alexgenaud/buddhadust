					<p class="f4">Then Channa the Wanderer<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> went to <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a> and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Ānanda,<br />
					"Do you, too, friend Ānanda, advocate the abandoning of passion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you advocate the abandoning of aversion?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you advocate the abandoning of delusion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, my friend, there is a path, there is a way<br />
