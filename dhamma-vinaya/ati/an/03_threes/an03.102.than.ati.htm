					<p class="f4">"And, monks, as long as beings don’t know as it has come to be—with regard to the cosmos—the allure as the allure, the drawback as the drawback, and the escape as the escape, they have not escaped from this cosmos with its devas, Māras, and Brahmās, this generation with its contemplatives and brahmans, its royalty and common people, nor do they dwell disjoined from it, released from it, with unrestricted awareness.</p>
