					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once, monks, there was a king named <a id="pacetana">Pacetana</a>.<br />
					One day King Pacetana said to his chariot maker,<br />
					'My good chariot maker,<br />
					in six months time from now a battle will take place.<br />
					Can you make me a new pair of chariot wheels?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, your majesty, I can,'<br />
					the chariot maker replied to the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then in six months minus six days the chariot maker finished one wheel.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pacetana said to him,<br />
					'In six days time from now the battle will take place.<br />
					Will the pair of chariot wheels be finished?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Your majesty, in these six months minus six days,<br />
					I have finished one wheel.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'But can you finish the second wheel in these six days?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, your majesty, I can,'<br />
					the chariot maker replied to the king.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, after finishing the second wheel in six days,<br />
					the chariot maker took the pair of wheels to the king<br />
					and, on arrival, said to him,<br />
					'Here is your new pair of chariot wheels all finished, your majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And what is the difference between your wheel<br />
					that took six months minus six days to finish,<br />
					and your wheel that took six days to finish?</p>

					<p class="f4">I don't see any difference between them at all.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'There is a difference between them, your majesty.</p>

					<p class="f4">Look at the difference.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the chariot maker took the chariot wheel finished in six days and set it rolling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going as far as its momentum carried it,<br />
					it twirled around and around and fell to the ground.<br />
					But then he took the chariot wheel<br />
					finished in six months minus six days<br />
					and set it rolling.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going as far as its momentum carried it,<br />
					it stood still as if fixed on an axle.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Now what is the reason,<br />
					my good chariot maker,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why the chariot wheel finished in six days,<br />
					when set rolling,<br />
					goes as far as its momentum carries it<br />
					and then, twirling around and around,<br />
					falls to the ground?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the reason,<br />
					what is the cause,<br />
					why the chariot wheel finished in six months minus six days,<br />
					when set rolling,<br />
					goes as far as its momentum carries it<br />
					and then stands still as if fixed on an axle?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Your majesty,<br />
					as for the wheel finished in six days,<br />
					its rim is crooked,<br />
					with faults and flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its spokes are crooked,<br />
					with faults and flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its hub is crooked,<br />
					with faults and flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because its rim... spokes... [and] hub are crooked,<br />
					with faults and flaws,<br />
					when set rolling<br />
					it goes as far as its momentum carries it<br />
					and then, twirling around and around,<br />
					falls to the ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as for the wheel finished in six months minus six days,<br />
					its rim is not crooked,<br />
					with no faults or flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its spokes are not crooked,<br />
					with no faults or flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Its hub is not crooked,<br />
					with no faults or flaws.</p>

					<p class="f4">Because its rim... spokes... [and] hub are not crooked,<br />
					with no faults or flaws,<br />
					when set rolling<br />
					it goes as far as its momentum carries it<br />
					and then stands still as if fixed on an axle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, monks, the thought may occur to you<br />
					that the chariot maker on that occasion<br />
					was someone else,<br />
					but it shouldn't be seen in that way.</p>

					<p class="f4">I myself was the chariot maker on that occasion.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was skilled in dealing with the crookedness,<br />
					the faults, the flaws of wood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now I am a worthy one,<br />
					rightly self-awakened,<br />
					skilled in dealing with the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of bodily action;<br />
					skilled in dealing with the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of verbal action;<br />
					skilled in dealing with the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of mental action.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any monk or nun in whom the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of bodily action<br />
					are not abandoned;<br />
					the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of verbal action<br />
					are not abandoned;<br />
					the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of mental action<br />
					are not abandoned<br />
					has fallen away from this Dhamma and Discipline,<br />
					just like the wheel finished in six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">But any monk or nun in whom the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of bodily action<br />
					are abandoned;<br />
					the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of verbal action<br />
					are abandoned;<br />
					the crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws of mental action<br />
					are abandoned<br />
					stands firm in this Dhamma and Discipline,<br />
					just like the wheel finished in six months minus six days.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus you should train yourselves:<br />
					'We will abandon crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws in bodily action.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws in verbal action.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will abandon crookedness,<br />
					faults, and flaws in mental action.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how you should train yourselves."</p>
