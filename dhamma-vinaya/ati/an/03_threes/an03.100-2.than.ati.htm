<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 100, part 2. The Buddha compares the process of attaining the higher mind through meditation to the steps required for the refining of gold. The goldsmith balances use of heat, cooling and examination; the bhikkhu must balance his development of serenity, energy and detachment. In the same way that over-emphasis of one aspect of the process by the goldsmith will likely result in the ruination of the gold, the over-emphasis by the bhikkhu on samadhi will result in sloth, overemphasis on energy building will result in anxiety, and overemphasis on objective detachment will result in the lack of serenity necessary to end the corrupting influences. There are in this sutta very helpful descriptions of the faults to be looked for and got rid of for each stage of advancement in the meditative process." />

					<p class="f4">If he were to attend solely to the theme of uplifted energy,<br />

					<p class="f4">If he were to attend solely to the theme of equanimity,<br />

					<p class="f4">But when he attends periodically to the theme of concentration,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is rightly concentrated for the ending of the effluents.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="goldsmith">Just as if</a> a goldsmith or goldsmith's apprentice<br />
					were to set up a smelter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having set up the smelter,<br />
					he would fire the receptacle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having fired the receptacle,<br />
					he would take hold of some gold with his tongs<br />
					and place it in the receptacle.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Periodically he would blow on it,<br />
					periodically sprinkle it with water,<br />
					periodically examine it closely.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he were solely to blow on it,<br />

					<p class="f4">If he were solely to sprinkle it with water,<br />
					it is possible that the gold would grow cold.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he were solely to examine it closely,<br />
					it is possible that the gold would not come to full perfection.</p>

					<p class="f4">But when he periodically blows on it,<br />
					periodically sprinkles it with water,<br />
					periodically examines it closely,<br />
					the gold becomes pliant, malleable, and luminous.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is not brittle, and is ready to be worked.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind<br />
					— whether a belt, an earring, a necklace, or a gold chain —<br />
					the gold would serve his purpose.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way,<br />
					a monk intent on heightened mind<br />
					should attend periodically to three themes:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He should attend periodically to the theme of concentration;<br />

					<p class="f4">It is rightly concentrated for the ending of the effluents.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And then whichever of the higher knowledges<br />
					he turns his mind to know and realize,<br />
					he can witness them for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he wields manifold supranormal powers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having been one he becomes many;<br />
					having been many he becomes one.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He appears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He vanishes.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains<br />
					as if through space.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He dives in and out of the earth<br />
					as if it were water.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He walks on water without sinking<br />
					as if it were dry land.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air<br />
					like a winged bird.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With his hand he touches and strokes<br />
					even the sun and moon,<br />
					so mighty and powerful.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He exercises influence with his body<br />
					even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants, he hears<br />
					— by means of the divine ear-element,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					both kinds of sounds:<br />
					divine and human,<br />
					whether near or far.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals,<br />
					having encompassed it with his own awareness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with passion<br />
					as 'a mind with passion,'<br />
					and a mind without passion<br />
					as 'a mind without passion.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with aversion<br />
					as 'a mind with aversion,'<br />
					and a mind without aversion<br />
					as 'a mind without aversion.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with delusion<br />
					as 'a mind with delusion,'<br />
					and a mind without delusion<br />
					as 'a mind without delusion.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a restricted mind<br />
					as 'a restricted mind,'<br />
					and a scattered mind<br />
					as 'a scattered mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns an enlarged mind<br />
					as 'an enlarged mind,'<br />
					and an unenlarged mind<br />
					as 'an unenlarged mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a surpassed mind<br />
					[one that is not at the most excellent level]<br />
					as 'a surpassed mind,'<br />
					and an unsurpassed mind<br />
					as 'an unsurpassed mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a concentrated mind<br />
					as 'a concentrated mind,'<br />
					and an unconcentrated mind<br />
					as 'an unconcentrated mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He discerns a released mind<br />
					as 'a released mind,'<br />
					and an unreleased mind<br />
					as 'an unreleased mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he recollects his manifold past lives<br />
					[literally: previous homes],<br />
					i.e., one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four, five, ten,<br />
					twenty, thirty, forty,<br />
					fifty,<br />
					one hundred,<br />
					one thousand,<br />
					one hundred thousand,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic contraction,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic expansion,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion,<br />
					[recollecting]:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'There I had such a name,<br />
					belonged to such a clan,<br />
					had such an appearance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					such the end of my life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />
					I re-arose there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There too I had such a name,<br />
					belonged to such a clan,<br />
					had such an appearance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					such the end of my life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />
					I re-arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he remembers his manifold past lives<br />
					in their modes and details.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants, he sees<br />
					— by means of the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are inferior and superior,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'These beings<br />
					— who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who reviled the noble ones,<br />
					held wrong views<br />
					and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views —<br />
					with the break-up of the body, after death,<br />
					have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation,<br />
					the bad destination,<br />
					the lower realms,<br />
					in hell.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But these beings<br />
					— who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who did not revile the noble ones,<br />
					who held right views<br />
					and undertook actions under the influence of right views —<br />
					with the break-up of the body, after death,<br />
					have re-appeared in the good destinations,<br />
					in the heavenly world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus — by means of the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					he sees beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are inferior and superior,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					then through the ending of the mental effluents,<br />
					he enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release,<br />
					having known and realized them for himself<br />
					right in the here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening."</p>
