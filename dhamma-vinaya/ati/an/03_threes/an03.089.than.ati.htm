					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The training in heightened virtue,<br />
					the training in heightened mind,<br />
					the training in heightened discernment.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in heightened virtue?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is virtuous.<br />
					He dwells restrained in accordance with the <i>Pāṭimokkha,</i><br />
					consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He trains himself,<br />
					having undertaken the training rules,<br />
					seeing danger in the slightest fault.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened virtue.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in heightened mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk<br />
					— quite secluded from sensuality,<br />
					secluded from unskillful qualities —<br />
					enters and remains in the first jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of seclusion,<br />
					accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the stilling of directed thought and evaluations,<br />
					he enters and remains in the second jhāna:<br />
					rapture and pleasure born of concentration,<br />
					unification of awareness<br />
					free from directed thought and evaluation<br />
					— internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">With the fading of rapture he remains equanimous,<br />
					mindful and alert,<br />
					and senses pleasure with the body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna,<br />
					of which the Noble Ones declare,<br />
					'Equanimous and mindful,<br />
					he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">With the abandoning of pleasure and pain<br />
					— as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress —<br />
					he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna:<br />
					purity of equanimity and mindfulness,<br />
					neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened mind.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the training in heightened discernment?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk,<br />
					through the ending of the effluents,<br />
					enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release,<br />
					having directly known and realized them for himself<br />
					right in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the training in heightened discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the three trainings."</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Heightened virtue,<br />
					heightened mind,<br />
					heightened discernment:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; firm,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; steadfast,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absorbed in <i>jhāna,</i><br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mindful,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with guarded faculties<br />
					you should practice them —</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as in front,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so behind;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as behind,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so in front;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as below,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so above;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as above,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so below;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as by day,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so by night;<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as by night,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so by day;<br />
					conquering all the directions<br />
					with limitless concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">This is called<br />
					the practice of training,<br />
					as well as the pure way of life.<br />
					[Following it,] you're called <br />
					self-awakened in the world,<br />
					enlightened,<br />
					one who's taken the path<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to its end.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">With the cessation of sensory consciousness<br />
					of one released in the stopping of craving,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the liberation of awareness<br />
					of one released in the stopping of craving,<br />
					is like the unbinding <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of a flame.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
