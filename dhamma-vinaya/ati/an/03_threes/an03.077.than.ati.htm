Ānanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, this word, 'becoming, becoming' — to what extent is there becoming?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, if there were no kamma ripening in the sensuality-property,<br />
					would sensuality-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus kamma is the field,<br />
					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intention and aspiration of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />
					is established in/tuned to a lower property.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were no kamma ripening in the form-property,<br />
					would form-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus kamma is the field,<br />
					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intention and aspiration of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />
					is established in/tuned to a middling property.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus there is the production of renewed becoming in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If there were no kamma ripening in the formless-property,<br />
					would formless-becoming be discerned?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus kamma is the field,<br />
					consciousness the seed,<br />
					and craving the moisture.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intention and aspiration of living beings<br />
					hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving<br />
					is established in/tuned to a lower property.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there is becoming."</p>
