					<p class="f4">Now at that time — it being the Uposatha day — <a id="visakha">Visākhā</a>, Migara's mother, went to the Blessed One in the middle of the day and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.<br />
					As she was sitting there the Blessed One said to her,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well now, Visākhā, why are you coming in the middle of the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Today I am observing the Uposatha, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Visākhā, there are these three Uposathas.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which three?</p>

					<p class="f4">The Uposatha of a cowherd,<br />
					the Uposatha of the Jains,<br />
					and the Uposatha of the Noble Ones.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the Uposatha of a cowherd?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="cowherd">Just as</a> when a cowherd returns the cattle to their owners in the evening, he reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Today the cattle wandered to that spot and this,<br />
					drank at this spot and that;<br />
					tomorrow they will wander to that spot and this,<br />
					will drink at this spot and that';<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					there is the case where a certain person observing the Uposatha reflects,<br />
					'Today I ate this sort of non-staple food and that sort of staple food.<br />
					Tomorrow I will eat that sort of non-staple food and this sort of staple food.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends the day with an awareness imbued with that covetousness,<br />
					with that greed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the Uposatha of a cowherd, Visākhā.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this Uposatha of a cowherd is undertaken,<br />
					it is not of great fruit or great benefit,<br />
					not of great glory or great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the Uposatha of the <a id="jains">Jains</a>? There are the contemplatives called the <a id="nigantha">Nigaṇṭhas</a> (Jains).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They get their disciple to undertake the following practice:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Here, my good man. Lay down the rod with regard to beings who live more than 100 leagues to the east...<br />
					more than 100 leagues to the west...<br />
					more than 100 leagues to the north...<br />
					more than 100 leagues to the south.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus they get the disciple to undertake kindness and sympathy to some beings, but not to others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"On the Uposatha day, they get their disciple to undertake the following practice:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Here, my good man. Having stripped off all your clothing, say this:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I am nothing by anything or of anything.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus there is nothing by anything or of anything that is mine."'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet in spite of that, his parents know of him that 'This is our child.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows of them that 'These are my parents.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His wives and children know of him that 'This is our husband and father.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows of them that 'These are my wives and children.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His workers and slaves know of him that 'This is our master.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows of them that 'These are my workers and slaves.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Thus at a time when he should be persuaded to undertake truthfulness, he is persuaded to undertake falsehood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">At the end of the night, he resumes the consumption of his belongings, even though they aren't given back to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This counts as stealing, I tell you.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the Uposatha of the Jains, Visākhā.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this Uposatha of the Jains is undertaken, it is not of great fruit or great benefit, not of great glory or great radiance.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the Uposatha of the Noble Ones?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is the cleansing of the defiled mind through the proper technique.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="recall-Buddha">There is the case</a> where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the Tathāgata, thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is recollecting the Tathāgata, his mind is calmed, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, <a id="headcleaning">just as</a> when the head is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is the head cleansed through the proper technique?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Through the use of cosmetic paste and clay and the appropriate human effort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how the head is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, the defiled mind is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is thus called a disciple of the noble ones undertaking the Brahma-Uposatha.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He lives with Brahma [= the Buddha].</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is owing to Brahma that his mind is calmed, that joy arises, and that whatever defilements there are in his mind are abandoned.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how the mind is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>

					<p class="f4">"[Again, the Uposatha of the Noble Ones] is the cleansing of the mind through the proper technique.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is the defiled mind cleansed through the proper technique?</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="recall-Dhamma">There is the case</a> where the disciple of the noble ones recollects the Dhamma, thus:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he is recollecting the Dhamma, his mind is calmed, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, <a id="bodycleaning">just as</a> when the body is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is recollecting the Saŋgha, his mind is calmed, and joy arises; the defilements of his mind are abandoned, <a id="laundry">just as</a> when clothing is cleansed through the proper technique.</p>
