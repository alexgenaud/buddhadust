<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Threes, Sutta 100, part 1. The Buddha compares the process of attaining the higher mind through meditation to the steps required for the refining of gold. The goldsmith balances use of heat, cooling and examination; the bhikkhu must balance his development of serenity, energy and detachment. In the same way that over-emphasis of one aspect of the process by the goldsmith will likely result in the ruination of the gold, the over-emphasis by the bhikkhu on samadhi will result in sloth, overemphasis on energy building will result in anxiety, and overemphasis on objective detachment will result in the lack of serenity necessary to end the corrupting influences. There are in this sutta very helpful descriptions of the faults to be looked for and got rid of for each stage of advancement in the meditative process." />

					<p class="f4">The dirt-washer or his apprentice,<br />

					<p class="f4">"When he is rid of them,<br />
					there remain the moderate impurities in the gold:<br />

					<p class="f4">He washes the gold again and again<br />

					<p class="f4">"When he is rid of them,<br />

					washes the gold again and again<br />

					<p class="f4">The goldsmith or his apprentice,<br />

					<p class="f4">The gold, as long as it has not been blown on again and again<br />
					to the point where the impurities are blown away,<br />

					<p class="f4">It is not brittle, and is ready to be worked.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then whatever sort of ornament he has in mind<br />

					<p class="f4">"In the same way,<br />
					there are these gross impurities<br />
					in a monk intent on heightened mind:<br />
					misconduct in body, speech, and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">These the monk<br />
					— aware and able by nature —<br />
					abandons, destroys, dispels,<br />
					wipes out of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he is rid of them,<br />
					there remain in him the moderate impurities:<br />

					<p class="f4">"When he is rid of them,<br />

					<p class="f4">His concentration is neither calm nor refined,<br />
					has not yet attained calm or unification,<br />

					<p class="f4">But there comes a time<br />
					when his mind grows steady inwardly,<br />
					settles down,<br />
					grows unified and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">His concentration is peaceful and refined,<br />
					has attained calm and unification,<br />
					and is no longer kept in place<br />

					<p class="f4">"And then whichever of the higher knowledges<br />
					he turns his mind to know and realize,<br />
					he can witness them for himself<br />

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he wields manifold supranormal powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been one he becomes many;<br />

					<p class="f4">He appears.</p>

					<p class="f4">He vanishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes unimpeded through walls, ramparts, and mountains<br />

					<p class="f4">Sitting cross-legged he flies through the air<br />

					<p class="f4">With his hand he touches and strokes<br />
					even the sun and moon,<br />
					so mighty and powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exercises influence with his body<br />
					even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants, he hears<br />
					— by means of the divine ear-element,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					both kinds of sounds:<br />
					divine and human,<br />
					whether near or far.</p>

					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he knows the awareness of other beings, other individuals,<br />
					having encompassed it with his own awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with passion<br />
					as 'a mind with passion,'<br />
					and a mind without passion<br />
					as 'a mind without passion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with aversion<br />
					as 'a mind with aversion,'<br />
					and a mind without aversion<br />
					as 'a mind without aversion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with delusion<br />
					as 'a mind with delusion,'<br />
					and a mind without delusion<br />
					as 'a mind without delusion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a restricted mind<br />
					as 'a restricted mind,'<br />

					as 'a scattered mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns an enlarged mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />

					[one that is not at the most excellent level]<br />

					as 'an unsurpassed mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a concentrated mind<br />
					as 'a concentrated mind,'<br />
					and an unconcentrated mind<br />
					as 'an unconcentrated mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a released mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />

					and an unreleased mind<br />
					as 'an unreleased mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					he recollects his manifold past lives<br />
					[literally: previous homes],<br />
					i.e., one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four, five, ten,<br />
					twenty, thirty, forty,<br />
					fifty,<br />
					one hundred,<br />
					one thousand,<br />
					one hundred thousand,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic contraction,<br />

					many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion,<br />
					[recollecting]:</p>

					<p class="f4">'There I had such a name,<br />
					belonged to such a clan,<br />
					had such an appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of pleasure and pain,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />

					<p class="f4">There too I had such a name,<br />

					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />

					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus he remembers his manifold past lives<br />
					in their modes and details.</p>

					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants, he sees<br />
					— by means of the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are inferior and superior,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These beings<br />
					— who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who reviled the noble ones,<br />
					held wrong views<br />
					and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views —<br />

					have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation,<br />
					the bad destination,<br />
					the lower realms,<br />
					in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these beings<br />
					— who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who did not revile the noble ones,<br />
					who held right views<br />
					and undertook actions under the influence of right views —<br />
					with the break-up of the body, after death,<br />

					<p class="f4">Thus — by means of the divine eye,<br />

					he sees beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are inferior and superior,<br />

					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">He can witness this for himself<br />
					whenever there is an opening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If he wants,<br />
					then through the ending of the mental effluents,<br />
					he enters and remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release,<br />
