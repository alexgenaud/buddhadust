					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "There is the case where a monk lives in dependence on a certain town or village.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or householder's son, approaching him, invites him for the next day's meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he wants to, he acquiesces.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night has passed, early in the morning, he adjusts his under robe and — carrying his bowl and robes — goes to the residence of that householder or householder's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sits down on a seat laid out.</p>

					<p class="f4">The householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies the monk with exquisite staple and non-staple food.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurs to the monk, 'How good it is that this householder or householder's son serves and satisfies me with exquisite staple and non-staple food!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the thought also occurs to him, 'O, may this householder or householder's son in the future serve and satisfy me with this sort of exquisite staple and non-staple food!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He consumes that almsfood attached to it, infatuated, guilty, not seeing the drawbacks (of attachment to it), and not discerning the escape from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to it, he thinks thoughts of sensuality, thoughts of ill will, thoughts of harmfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is given to a monk of this sort, I tell you, is not of great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the monk remains heedless.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But there is the case where a monk lives in dependence on a certain town or village.</p>

					<p class="f4">A householder or householder's son, approaching him, invites him for the next day's meal.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he wants to, he acquiesces.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the night has passed, early in the morning, he adjusts his under robe and — carrying his bowl and robes — goes to the residence of that householder or householder's son.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sits down on a seat laid out.</p>

					<p class="f4">The householder or householder's son, with his own hand, serves and satisfies the monk with exquisite staple and non-staple food.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought doesn't occur to the monk, 'How good it is that this householder or householder's son serves and satisfies me with exquisite staple and non-staple food!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the thought also doesn't occur to him, 'O, may this householder or householder's son in the future serve and satisfy me with this sort of exquisite staple and non-staple food!'</p>

					<p class="f4">He consumes that almsfood unattached to it, uninfatuated, guiltless, seeing the drawbacks (of attachment to it), and discerning the escape from them.</p>

					<p class="f4">With regard to it, he thinks thoughts of renunciation, thoughts of non-ill will, thoughts of harmlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is given to a monk of this sort, I tell you, is of great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the monk remains heedful."</p>
