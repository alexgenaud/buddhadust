					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these five ways<br />
					of subduing hatred<br />
					by which,<br />
					when hatred arises in a monk,<br />
					he should wipe it out completely.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where some people are impure<br />
					in their bodily behavior<br />
					but pure in their verbal behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred for a person of this sort<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where some people are impure<br />
					in their verbal behavior<br />
					but pure in their bodily behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred for a person of this sort<br />
					should also be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where some people are impure<br />
					in their bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					but who periodically experience<br />
					mental clarity and calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Hatred for a person of this sort<br />
					should also be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case<br />
					where some people are impure<br />

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now as for a person who is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior<br />
					but pure in his verbal behavior,<br />
					how should one subdue hatred for him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a monk<br />
					who makes use of things<br />
					that are thrown away<br />
					sees a rag in the road:<br />
					Taking hold of it with his left foot<br />
					and spreading it out with his right,<br />
					he would tear off the sound part<br />
					and go off with it.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					when the individual is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior<br />
					but pure in his verbal behavior,<br />
					one should at that time<br />
					pay no attention<br />
					to the impurity of his bodily behavior,<br />
					and instead pay attention<br />
					to the purity of his verbal behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the hatred for him<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And as for a person who is impure<br />
					in his verbal behavior,<br />
					but pure in his bodily behavior,<br />
					how should one subdue hatred for him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when there is a pool<br />
					overgrown with slime and water plants,<br />
					and a person comes along,<br />
					burning with heat,<br />
					covered with sweat,<br />
					exhausted, trembling, and thirsty.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would jump into the pool,<br />
					part the slime and water plants<br />
					with both hands, and then,<br />
					cupping his hands,<br />
					drink the water<br />
					and go on his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					when the individual is impure<br />
					in his verbal behavior<br />
					but pure in his bodily behavior,<br />
					one should at that time<br />
					pay no attention to the impurity of his verbal behavior,<br />
					and instead pay attention<br />
					to the purity of his bodily behavior.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the hatred for him<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And as for a person who is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					but who periodically experiences<br />
					mental clarity and calm,<br />
					how should one subdue hatred for him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when there is a little puddle<br />
					in a cow's footprint,<br />
					and a person comes along,<br />
					burning with heat,<br />
					covered with sweat,<br />
					exhausted, trembling, and thirsty.<br />
					The thought would occur to him,<br />
					'Here is this little puddle<br />
					in a cow's footprint.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I tried to drink the water<br />
					using my hand or cup,<br />
					I would disturb it,<br />
					stir it up, and make it unfit to drink.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to get down on all fours<br />
					and slurp it up like a cow,<br />
					and then go on my way?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he would get down on all fours,<br />
					slurp up the water like a cow,<br />
					and then go on his way.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					when an individual is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					but periodically experiences mental clarity and calm,<br />
					one should at that time<br />
					pay no attention<br />
					to the impurity of his bodily behavior ...<br />
					the impurity of his verbal behavior,<br />
					and instead pay attention<br />
					to the fact<br />
					that he periodically experiences<br />
					mental clarity and calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the hatred for him<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And as for a person who is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					and who does not periodically experience<br />
					mental clarity and calm,<br />
					how should one subdue hatred for him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when there is a sick man<br />
					— in pain, seriously ill —<br />
					traveling along a road,<br />
					far from the next village<br />
					and far from the last,<br />
					unable to get the food he needs,<br />
					unable to get the medicine he needs,<br />
					unable to get a suitable assistant,<br />
					unable to get anyone<br />
					to take him to human habitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now suppose another person<br />
					were to see him coming along the road.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would do what he could<br />
					out of compassion, pity, and sympathy<br />
					for the man, thinking,<br />
					'O that this man should get the food he needs,<br />
					the medicine he needs,<br />
					a suitable assistant,<br />
					someone to take him<br />
					to human habitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">So that he won't fall into ruin right here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					when a person is impure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					and who does not periodically experience<br />
					mental clarity and calm,<br />
					one should do what one can<br />
					out of compassion, pity, and sympathy for him,<br />
					thinking,<br />
					'O that this man should abandon<br />
					wrong bodily conduct<br />
					and develop right bodily conduct,<br />
					abandon wrong verbal conduct<br />
					and develop right verbal conduct,<br />
					abandon wrong mental conduct<br />
					and develop right mental conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">So that, on the break-up of the body, after death,<br />
					he won't fall into the plane of deprivation,<br />
					the bad destination,<br />
					the lower realms, purgatory.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the hatred for him<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And as for a person who is pure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					and who periodically experiences mental clarity and calm,<br />
					how should one subdue hatred for him?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when there is a pool of clear water<br />
					— sweet, cool, and limpid,<br />
					with gently sloping banks,<br />
					and shaded on all sides<br />
					by trees of many kinds —<br />
					and a person comes along,<br />
					burning with heat,<br />
					covered with sweat,<br />
					exhausted, trembling, and thirsty.<br />
					Having plunged into the pool,<br />
					having bathed and drunk<br />
					and come back out,<br />
					he would sit down<br />
					or lie down right there<br />
					in the shade of the trees.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way,<br />
					when an individual is pure<br />
					in his bodily behavior and verbal behavior,<br />
					and periodically experiences<br />
					mental clarity and calm,<br />
					one should at that time<br />
					pay attention to the purity<br />
					of his bodily behavior<br />
					... the purity of his verbal behavior,<br />
					and to the fact<br />
					that he periodically experiences<br />
					mental clarity and calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the hatred for him<br />
					should be subdued.</p>

					<p class="f4">An entirely inspiring individual<br />
					can make the mind grow serene.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are five ways<br />
					of subduing hatred<br />
					by which, when hatred arises in a monk,<br />
					he should wipe it out completely."</p>
