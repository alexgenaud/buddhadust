					<p class="f4">"Loving-kindness can be maintained in being<br />
					towards a person with whom you are annoyed:<br />
					this is how annoyance with him can be removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Compassion can be maintained in being<br />
					towards a person with whom you are annoyed;<br />
					this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Onlooking equanimity can be maintained in being<br />
					towards a person with whom you are annoyed;<br />
					this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The forgetting and ignoring of a person with whom you are annoyed can be practiced;<br />
					this too is how annoyance with him can be removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ownership of deeds<br />
					in a person with whom you are annoyed<br />
					can be concentrated upon thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This good person is owner of his deeds,<br />
					heir to his deeds,<br />
					his deeds are the womb<br />
					from which he is born,<br />
					his deeds are his kin<br />
					for whom he is responsible,<br />
					his deeds are his refuge,<br />
					he is heir to his deeds,<br />
					be they good or bad.'<br />
					This too is how annoyance with him<br />
					can be removed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five ways<br />
					of removing annoyance,<br />
					by which annoyance<br />
					can be entirely removed in a bhikkhu<br />
					when it arises in him."</p>
