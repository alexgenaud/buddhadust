If a sick person can keep in mind the idea of their being nothing attractive in the body, the disgusting nature of food, the thought of distaste for the world, the perception of impermanance in everything that has been own-made, and has established in his mind the thought of death, he may expect Arahantship even in this life." />

					the Blessed One was staying near Vesālī,<br />
					in the Great Forest,<br />
					at the Gabled Pavilion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, in the late afternoon,<br />
					he left his seclusion<br />
					and went to the sick ward,<br />
					where he saw a monk who was weak and sickly.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Seeing him,<br />
					he sat down on a prepared seat.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there,<br />
					he addressed the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When these five things<br />
					don't leave a monk who is weak and sickly,<br />
					it can be expected of him<br />
					that, before long<br />
					— with the ending of the effluents —<br />
					he will enter and remain<br />
					in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release,<br />
					having realized and directly known them for himself<br />
					in the here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk<br />
					remains focused on unattractiveness<br />
					with regard to the body,<br />
					is percipient of loathsomeness in food,<br />
					is percipient of distaste<br />
					with regard to every world,<br />
					remains focused on inconstancy with regard to all fabrications.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The perception of death<br />
					well established within hims.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When these five things don't leave a monk<br />
					who is weak and sickly,<br />
					it can be expected of him<br />
					that, before long<br />
					— with the ending of the effluents —<br />
					he will enter and remain<br />
					in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release,<br />
					having realized and directly known them for himself<br />
					in the here and now."</p>
