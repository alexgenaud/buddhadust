					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p>This discourse is addressed to monks, and deals with their battle to maintain their celibacy and to come out victorious in the practice. The Buddha compares the victorious monk with a victorious warrior, an analogy that was probably intended to appeal to the monks' masculine pride (see <a href="../07_sevens/an07.048.than.ati.htm">AN 5 48</a>). In this analogy, a celibate is not a wimp, but is instead a warrior to the highest degree. Because the first confrontation for a man trying to maintain his celibacy involves his attraction to women, women play the role of first-line enemy in this discourse.</p>
					
					<p>Unfortunately, we don't have any record of how the Buddha advised his nun followers on how to maintain their celibacy, so we don't know if he would have used a woman-warrior analogy when teaching them to resist their attraction to men, or if he would have replaced it with another analogy to appeal more specifically to their feminine pride (again, see <a href="../07_sevens/an07.048.than.ati.htm">AN 5 48</a>). However, there are discourses in the Pali Canon that depict nuns as successfully maintaining their celibacy when confronted by men in the forest. A prime example is <a href="../../kd/thig/thig.14.than.ati.htm">Therīgāthā 14</a>; there are other examples of nuns resisting temptation in the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_05_bhikkhunisamyutta.htm">Bhikkhunī Saɱyutta</a>.</p>
					
					<p>Ultimately, of course, the true enemy lies, not without, but within. This is shown by the fact that the monk in this discourse has to go off alone and put an end to the effluent of sensual passion in his own mind before he can be considered truly victorious.</p>
