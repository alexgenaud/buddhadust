					<p class="f4">Then <a id="siha">General Sīha</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it possible, lord, to point out a fruit of giving visible in the here and now?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is possible, Sīha.</p>

					<p class="f4">One who is generous, a master of giving, is dear and charming to people at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fact that who is generous, a master of giving, is dear and charming to people at large: this is a fruit of giving visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, good people, people of integrity, admire one who is generous, a master of giving.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fact that good people, people of integrity, admire one who is generous, a master of giving: this, too, is a fruit of giving visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the fine reputation of one who is generous, a master of giving, is spread far and wide.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fact that the fine reputation of one who is generous, a master of giving, is spread far and wide: this, too, is a fruit of giving visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, when one who is generous, a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people — noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives — he/she does so confidently and without embarrassment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fact that when one who is generous, a master of giving, approaches any assembly of people — noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives — he/she does so confidently and without embarrassment: this, too, is a fruit of giving visible in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, at the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the fact that at the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world: this is a fruit of giving in the next life."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, General Sīha said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"As for the four fruits of generosity visible in the here and now that have been pointed out by the Blessed One, it's not the case that I go by conviction in the Blessed One with regard to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">I know them, too.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who is generous, a master of giving, dear and charming to people at large.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who is generous, a master of giving; good people, people of integrity, admire me.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who is generous, a master of giving, and my fine reputation is spread far and wide:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Sīha is generous, a doer, a supporter of the Saŋgha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I am one who is generous, a master of giving, and when I approach any assembly of people — noble warriors, brahmans, householders, or contemplatives — I do so confidently and without embarrassment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world,' that I do not know.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, Sīha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">At the break-up of the body, after death, one who is generous, a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">One who gives is dear.<br />
							People at large admire him.<br />
							He gains honor. His status grows.<br />
							He enters an assembly unembarrassed.<br />
							He is confident — the unmiserly man.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Therefore the wise give gifts.<br />
							Seeking bliss, they would subdue the stain of miserliness.<br />
							Established in the three-fold heavenly world,<br />
							they enjoy themselves long<br />
							in fellowship with the devas.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Having made the opportunity for themselves,<br />
							having done what is skillful,<br />
							then when they fall from here<br />
							they fare on, self-radiant, in <a id="nandana">Nandana</a> [the garden of the devas].</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">There they delight, enjoy, are joyful,<br />
							replete with the five sensuality strands.<br />
							Having followed the words of the sage who is Such,<br />
							they enjoy themselves in heaven —<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;disciples of the One Well-gone.</p>
