The Buddha contrasts the ability of a king's elephant to listen, destroy, guard himself, endure hardships and go where he has not gone before to the bhikkhu's ability to listen, destroy bad ideas, guard himself against alluring sense impressions, endure hardships, and go where he has not gone before." />

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk a listener?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is a listener.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk a destroyer?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk does not tolerate an arisen thought of sensuality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He abandons it, destroys it, dispels it, and wipes it out of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">an arisen thought of harmfulness...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He does not tolerate arisen evil, unskillful qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He abandons them, destroys them, dispels them, and wipes them out of existence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is a destroyer.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk a protector? There is the case where a monk, on seeing a form with the eye, does not grasp at any theme or particulars by which — if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye — evil, unskillful qualities such as greed or distress might assail him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He practices with restraint.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He guards the faculty of the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how a monk is a protector.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk an endurer?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is resilient to cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind, sun, and reptiles; ill-spoken, unwelcome words and bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, disagreeable, displeasing, and menacing to life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is an endurer.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk a goer?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk goes right away to that direction to which he has never been before in the course of this long stretch of time — in other words, to the resolution of all fabrications, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the ending of craving, dispassion, cessation, Unbinding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is a goer.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Endowed with these five qualities a monk is deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, an unexcelled field of merit for the world."</p>
