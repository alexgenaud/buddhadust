					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk is virtuous.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dwells restrained in accordance with the Pāṭimokkha, consummate in his behavior and sphere of activity.</p>

					<p class="f4">He trains himself, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He has heard much, has retained what he has heard, has stored what he has heard.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever teachings are admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end, that — in their meaning and expression — proclaim the holy life that is entirely perfect, surpassingly pure: Those he has listened to often, retained, discussed, accumulated, examined with his mind, and well-penetrated in terms of his views.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is content with any old robe cloth at all, any old alms food, any old lodging, any old medicinal requisites for curing sickness at all.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He attains — whenever he wants, without strain, without difficulty — the four jhānas that are heightened mental states, pleasant abidings in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He — with the ending of effluents — remains in the effluent-free awareness-release and discernment-release, having directly known and realized them for himself right in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Endowed with these five qualities, monks, a monk is one of the four directions."</p>
