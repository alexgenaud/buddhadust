					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am now living alone in the wilderness.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am living alone in the wilderness a snake might bite me, a scorpion might sting me, a centipede might bite me.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So let me make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk living in the wilderness — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am now living alone in the wilderness.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am living alone in the wilderness, stumbling, I might fall; my food, digested, might trouble me; my bile might be provoked, my phlegm... piercing wind forces (in the body) might be provoked.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So let me make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk living in the wilderness — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am now living alone in the wilderness.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am living alone in the wilderness, I might meet up with vicious beasts: a lion or a tiger or a leopard or a bear or a hyena.</p>

					<p class="f4">They might take my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So let me make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk living in the wilderness — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am now living alone in the wilderness.</p>

					<p class="f4">While I am living alone in the wilderness, I might meet up with youths on their way to committing a crime or on their way back.</p>

					<p class="f4">They might take my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be how my death would come about.</p>

					<p class="f4">That would be an obstruction for me.</p>

					<p class="f4">So let me make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk living in the wilderness — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk living in the wilderness reminds himself of this:</p>
