					<p class="f4">"Householder, you have provided the community of monks<br />

							<p>"seclusion and rapture" is not correct; it should be "the pīti proceeding from seclusion' however pīti is translated. 'Rapture' is not likely being spoken of here to Anāthapiṇḍika, but is more likely a lesser degree of liking: 'appreciation', the 'zest' of Hare, 'enthusiasm'.</p>
