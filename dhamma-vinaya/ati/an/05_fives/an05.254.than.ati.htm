					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="edn1" href="#edfn1">ed1</a>]</sup> Bhk. Thanissaro has suttas #254-259 grouped in this one file and notes: The suttas in this section of the Fives are formulaic, and the Canon does not give them names. The following group of suttas deals with the topic of stinginess, and so I have named the group after their topic. I have, in addition to this version of these suttas, also included each of the suttas individually.</p>
