					surrounded by about 500 lay followers,<br />
					went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One said to <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a>:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, when you know of a householder clothed in white,<br />
					that he is restrained<br />
					in terms of the five training rules<br />
					and that he obtains at will,<br />
					without difficulty,<br />
					without hardship,<br />
					four pleasant mental abidings<br />
					in the here and now,<br />
					then if he wants<br />
					he may state about himself:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Hell is ended for me;<br />

					abstains from taking life,<br />
					abstains from taking what is not given,<br />
					abstains from sexual misconduct,<br />
					abstains from lying,<br />
					abstains from distilled and fermented drinks<br />
					that cause heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five training rules<br />
					in terms of which<br />
					he is restrained.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first pleasant mental abiding<br />
