					<p class="f4">Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be, in the course of the future, monks desirous of fine robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, desirous of fine robes, will neglect the practice of wearing cast-off cloth; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of a robe they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the first future danger, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine food.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, desirous of fine food, will neglect the practice of going for alms; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there and searching out the tip-top tastes with the tip of the tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of food they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the second future danger, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, in the course of the future there will be monks desirous of fine lodgings.</p>

					<p class="f4">They, desirous of fine lodgings, will neglect the practice of living in the wilds; will neglect isolated forest and wilderness dwellings; will move to towns, cities, and royal capitals, taking up residence there.</p>

					<p class="f4">For the sake of lodgings they will do many kinds of unseemly, inappropriate things.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the third future danger, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with nuns, female probationers, and female novices.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they interact with nuns, female probationers, and female novices, they can be expected either to lead the holy life dissatisfied or to fall into one of the grosser offenses, leaving the training, returning to a lower way of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the fourth future danger, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, in the course of the future there will be monks who will live in close association with monastery attendants and novices.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they interact with monastery attendants and novices, they can be expected to live intent on storing up all kinds of possessions and to stake out crops and fields.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is the fifth future danger, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to it and, being alert, work to get rid of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, monks, are the five future dangers, unarisen at present, that will arise in the future.</p>

					<p class="f4">Be alert to them and, being alert, work to get rid of them.</p>
