					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk has conviction, is convinced of the Tathāgata's Awakening:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled as a trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is free from illness and discomfort, endowed with good digestion — not too cold, not too hot, of moderate strength — fit for exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is neither fraudulent nor deceitful. He declares himself to the Teacher or to his observant companions in the holy life in line with what he actually is.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and taking on skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He is discerning, endowed with discernment leading to the arising of the goal — noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are the five factors for exertion."</p>
