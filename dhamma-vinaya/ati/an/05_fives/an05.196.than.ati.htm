<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aŋguttara Nikāya, Fives, Sutta 196. Before his awakening, Gotama has five dreams revealing the future: that he would become the Awakened One, that he would see and know and establish the Eight-Dimensional High Way, that he would bring many lay persons to refuge in the Dhamma, that he will bring people of all colors and status from the four courners of the world to complete awakening, and that he would receive the essentials without attachment." />
