					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Strength of conviction,<br />
					strength of  a sense of shame,<br />
					strength of a sense of compunction,<br />
					strength of persistence, and<br />
					strength of discernment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is strength of conviction?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, has conviction, is convinced of the Tathāgata's Awakening:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called the strength of conviction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the strength of  a sense of shame?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones feels shame at [the thought of engaging in] bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">He feels shame at falling into evil, unskillful actions.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the strength of  a sense of shame.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the strength of a sense of compunction?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones feels compunction at [the suffering that would result from] bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct, mental misconduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the strength of a sense of compunction.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the strength of persistence?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, keeps his persistence aroused for abandoning unskillful qualities and taking on skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is steadfast, solid in his effort, not shirking his duties with regard to skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the strength of persistence.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the strength of discernment?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, a disciple of the noble ones, is discerning, endowed with discernment of arising and passing away — noble, penetrating, leading to the right ending of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the strength of discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These, monks, are the five strengths of one in training.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr c">§</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus you should train yourselves,<br />
					'We will be endowed with the strength of conviction that is the strength of one in training;<br />
					with the strength of  a sense of shame that is the strength of one in training;<br />
					the strength of a sense of compunction that is the strength of one in training;<br />
					the strength of persistence that is the strength of one in training;<br />
					the strength of discernment that is the strength of one in training.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how you should train yourselves."</p>
