					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">At present I am young, black-haired, endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">The time will come, though, when this body is beset by old age.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one is overcome with old age and decay, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that — endowed with that Dhamma — I will live in peace even when old.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">At present I am free from illness and discomfort, endowed with good digestion: not too cold, not too hot, of medium strength and tolerance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The time will come, though, when this body is beset with illness.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one is overcome with illness, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that — endowed with that Dhamma — I will live in peace even when ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">At present food is plentiful, alms are easy to come by.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage.</p>

					<p class="f4">The time will come, though, when there is famine: Food is scarce, alms are hard to come by, and it is not easy to maintain oneself by gleanings and patronage.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is famine, people will congregate where food is plentiful.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they will live packed and crowded together.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one is living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that — endowed with that Dhamma — I will live in peace even when there is famine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">At present people are in harmony, on friendly terms, without quarreling, like milk mixed with water, viewing one another with eyes of affection.</p>

					<p class="f4">The time will come, though, when there is danger and an invasion of savage tribes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Taking power, they will surround the countryside.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is danger, people will congregate where it is safe.</p>

					<p class="f4">There they will live packed and crowded together.</p>

					<p class="f4">When one is living packed and crowded together, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that — endowed with that Dhamma — I will live in peace even when there is danger.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">And further, the monk reminds himself of this:</p>

					<p class="f4">At present the Saŋgha — in harmony, on friendly terms, without quarreling — lives in comfort with a single recitation.</p>

					<p class="f4">The time will come, though, when the Saŋgha splits.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Saŋgha is split, it is not easy to pay attention to the Buddha's teachings.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not easy to reside in isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before this unwelcome, disagreeable, displeasing thing happens, let me first make an effort for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized, so that — endowed with that Dhamma — I will live in peace even when the Saŋgha is split.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fifth future danger that is just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five future dangers that are just enough, when considered, for a monk — heedful, ardent, and resolute — to live for the attaining of the as-yet-unattained, the reaching of the as-yet-unreached, the realization of the as-yet-unrealized.</p>
