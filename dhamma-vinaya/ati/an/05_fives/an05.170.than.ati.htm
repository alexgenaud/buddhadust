Ānanda was staying in Kosambī at Ghosita's monastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Bhaddaji went to Ven. Ānanda and exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Ānanda said to him,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What, friend Bhaddaji, is supreme among sights?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Supreme among sounds? Supreme among pleasures?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Supreme among perceptions?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Supreme among states of becoming?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There is, friend, the Great Brahmā, the Unconquered Conqueror, the All-Seeing Wielder of Power.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whoever sees that Brahmā, that is supreme among sights.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are, friend, the devas called Radiant, who are drenched &amp; overflowing with pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They, from time to time, exclaim, 'O, what pleasure! O, what pleasure.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whoever hears that sound, that is supreme among sounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are, friend, the devas called Beautiful Black.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They are sensitive to an extremely peaceful &amp; contented pleasure.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is supreme among pleasures.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are, friend, the devas who have reached the dimension of nothingness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is supreme among perceptions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There are, friend, the devas who have reached the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is supreme among states of becoming."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"So you agree on this, Bhaddaji, with the great mass of people?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Ven. Ānanda is learned.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let the answer occur to him."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In that case, friend Bhaddaji, listen &amp; pay close attention.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, friend," Ven. Bhaddaji responded to Ven. Ānanda.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Ven. Ānanda said,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However one has seen immediately prior to the ending of effluents: That is supreme among sights.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However one has heard immediately prior to the ending of effluents: That is supreme among sounds.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However one has pleasure immediately prior to the ending of effluents: That is supreme among pleasures.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However one has a perception immediately prior to the ending of effluents: That is supreme among perceptions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"However one has become immediately prior to the ending of effluents: That is supreme among states of becoming."</p>
