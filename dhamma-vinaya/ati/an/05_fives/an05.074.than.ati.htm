					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, 'One dwelling in the Dhamma, one dwelling in the Dhamma,' it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent is a monk dwelling in the Dhamma?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, monk, where a monk has mastered the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question and answer sessions [the earliest classifications of the Buddha's teachings].</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends the day in that mastery of the Dhamma, but he doesn't, with his discernment, discern its higher meaning/goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a monk big on mastery, but not one dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk who explains the Dhamma in detail to others, as he has heard it, as he has mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends the day in that description of the Dhamma, but he doesn't, with his discernment, discern its higher meaning/goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a monk big on description, but not one dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk recites the Dhamma as he has heard it, as he has mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends the day in that recitation of the Dhamma, but he doesn't, with his discernment, discern its higher meaning/goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a monk big on recitation, but not one dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk thinks about, evaluates, and mentally examines the Dhamma as he has heard it, as he has mastered it.</p>

					<p class="f4">He spends the day thinking about the Dhamma, but he doesn't, with his discernment, discern its higher meaning/goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a monk big on thinking, but not one dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, monk, where a monk has mastered the Dhamma: dialogues, narratives of mixed prose and verse, explanations, verses, spontaneous exclamations, quotations, birth stories, amazing events, question and answer sessions, and, with his discernment, he discerns its higher meaning/goal.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called a monk dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monk, I have taught you the one big on mastery, the one big on description, the one big on recitation, the one big on thinking, and the one dwelling in the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever a teacher should do — seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of sympathy for them — that have I done for you. Over there are (places to sit at) the roots of trees; over there, empty dwellings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Practice jhāna, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't be heedless.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't later fall into remorse.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our message to you."</p>
