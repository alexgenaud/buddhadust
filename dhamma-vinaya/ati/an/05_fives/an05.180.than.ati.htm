					<p class="f4">As he was going along a road,<br />
					he saw a large Sal forest in a certain place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Going down from the road,<br />
					he went to the Sal forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">On reaching it,<br />
					he plunged into it<br />
					and at a certain spot,<br />
					broke into a smile.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a>,</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br />
					what is the reason,<br />
					for the Blessed One's breaking into a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">It's not without purpose<br />
					that Tathāgata's break into smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">So he said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the cause,<br />
					what is the reason,<br />
					for the Blessed One's breaking into a smile?</p>

					<p class="f4">It's not without purpose<br />
					that Tathāgata's break into smile."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this spot, Ānanda,<br />
					there was once a great city:<br />
					powerful, prosperous, populous,<br />
					crowded with people.</p>

					<p class="f4">And on that city,<br />
					<a id="kassapa">Kassapa the Blessed One</a>,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened,<br />
					dwelled dependent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, Kassapa the Blessed One,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened,<br />
					had a lay follower named Gavesin<br />
					who didn't practice in full<br />
					in terms of his virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because of Gavesin,<br />
					there were 500 people<br />
					who had been inspired<br />
					to declare themselves lay followers,<br />
					and yet who also didn't practice in full<br />
					in terms of their virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to Gavesin the lay follower:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am the benefactor of these 500 lay followers,<br />
					their leader, the one who has inspired them.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I don't practice in full<br />
					in terms of my virtue,<br />
					just as they don't practice in full<br />
					in terms of their virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that we're exactly even;<br />
					there's nothing extra [for me].</p>

					<p class="f4">How about something extra!'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he went to the 500 lay followers<br />
					and on arrival said to them,</p>

					<p class="f4">'From today onward<br />
					I want you to know me<br />
					as someone who practices in full<br />
					in terms of my virtue.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to the 500 lay followers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gavesin is our benefactor, our leader,<br />
					the one who has inspired us.</p>

					<p class="f4">He will now practice in full<br />
					in terms of his virtue.<br />
					So why shouldn't we?'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they went to Gavesin the lay follower<br />
					and on arrival said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">'From today onward<br />
					we want Master Gavesin to know the 500 lay followers<br />
					as people who practice in full<br />
					in terms of their virtue.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="victory">So he</a> went to Kassapa the Blessed One,<br />

					<p class="f4">'Lord, may I receive the Going Forth<br />
					in the Blessed One's presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">May I receive the Full Acceptance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So he received the Going Forth<br />
					in the presence of Kassapa the Blessed One,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened;<br />
					he received the Going Forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his admission<br />
					— dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute —<br />
					he in no long time<br />
					reached and remained in<br />
					the supreme goal of the chaste life,<br />
					for which clansmen rightly go forth<br />
					from home into homelessness,<br />
					knowing and realizing it for himself<br />
					in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further<br />
					for the sake of this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus Gavesin the monk<br />
					became another one of the Arahants.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to the 500 lay followers:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Master Gavesin is our benefactor, our leader,<br />
					the one who has inspired us.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having shaven off his hair and beard,<br />
					having put on the ochre robe,<br />
					he has gone forth from the home life<br />
					into homelessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">So why shouldn't we?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So they went to Kassapa the Blessed One,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened,<br />
					and on arrival said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, may we receive the Going Forth<br />
					in the Blessed One's presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">May we receive the Full Acceptance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So they received the Going Forth<br />
					in the presence of Kassapa the Blessed One,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened;<br />
					they received the Going Forth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurred to Gavesin the monk:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I obtain at will<br />
					— without difficulty, without hardship —<br />
					this unexcelled bliss of release.</p>

					<p class="f4">O, that these 500 monks may obtain at will<br />
					— without difficulty, without hardship —<br />
					this unexcelled bliss of release!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those 500 monks<br />
					— dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute —<br />
					in no long time reached and remained in<br />
					the supreme goal of the chaste life,<br />
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from home<br />

					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further<br />
					for the sake of this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus did those 500 monks<br />
					— headed by Gavesin,<br />
					striving at what is more and more excellent,<br />
					more and more refined —<br />
					realize unexcelled release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So, Ānanda, you should train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Striving at what is more and more excellent,<br />
					more and more refined,<br />
					we will realize unexcelled release.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how you should train yourselves."</p>
