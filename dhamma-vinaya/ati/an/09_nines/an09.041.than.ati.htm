					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning the Blessed One — having adjusted his lower robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe — went into Uruvelakappa for alms.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Having gone into Uruvelakappa for alms, after his meal, on his return from his alms round, he said to Ven. Ānanda, "Stay right here, Ānanda, while I go into the Great Forest for the day's abiding."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Ānanda responded to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One went into the Great Forest and sat down at the root of a certain tree for the day's abiding.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Tapussa the householder went to Ven. Ānanda and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Ānanda: "Venerable Ānanda, sir, we are householders who indulge in sensuality, delight in sensuality, enjoy sensuality, rejoice in sensuality.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For us — indulging in sensuality, delighting in sensuality, enjoying sensuality, rejoicing in sensuality — renunciation seems like a sheer drop-off.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Yet I've heard that in this Dhamma and Vinaya the hearts of the very young monks leap up at renunciation, grow confident, steadfast, and firm, seeing it as peace.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So right here is where this Dhamma and Vinaya is contrary to the great mass of people: i.e., (this issue of) renunciation."</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">"This calls for a talk, householder.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let's go see the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Let's approach him and, on arrival, tell him this matter.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However he explains it to us, we will bear it in mind."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"As you say, sir," Tapussa the householder responded to Ven. Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="ctr c">&#9632;</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda, together with Tapussa the householder, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One: "Tapussa the householder, here, has said to me, 'Venerable Ānanda, sir, we are householders who indulge in sensuality, delight in sensuality, enjoy sensuality, rejoice in sensuality.</p>
