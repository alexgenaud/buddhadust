<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Aṇguttara Nikāya, Nines, Sutta 45. Ānanda explains the extent of what the Buddha meant by the idea of being 'by two-measures freed.' Such a one is both a seer-in-body and wisdom-freed. A seer-in-body is described as one who advances through the stages to arahantship in each case living in contact with the body. One who is wisdom-freed has advanced through the stages to arahantship seeing the wisdom of each stage." />

					<p class="f4">To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released both ways?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Ven. Ānanda:] "There is the case, my friend, where a monk, secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released both ways, though with a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhāna... the third jhāna... the fourth jhāna... the dimension of the infinitude of space... the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness... the dimension of nothingness... the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released both ways, though with a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains touching with his body in whatever way there is an opening there, and he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released both ways without a sequel."</p>
