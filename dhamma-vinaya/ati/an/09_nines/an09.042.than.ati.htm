					<p>"Now which, my friend, is the confining place?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And which opening in the confining place is the Blessed One said to have attained?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[Ven. Ānanda:] "The five strings of sensuality, my friend, are described by the Blessed One as a confining place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire;</p>
					
					<p class="f4">sounds cognizable via the ear...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">smells cognizable via the nose...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">tastes cognizable via the tongue...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">tactile sensations cognizable via the body — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These five strings of sensuality are described by the Blessed One as a confining place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now there is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For even there, there's a confining place.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What is the confining place there?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just that <i>directed thought &amp; evaluation</i> have not ceased.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just that <i>rapture</i> has not ceased.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the fading of rapture, remains in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, senses pleasure with the body, and enters &amp; remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p>Bhkkhu Thanissaro Notes here: The following three discourses show that, contrary to a popular misconception, the phrase, "Released through discernment" does not refer to a person who has attained release without experience of the jhānas. Instead, it refers to a person who has attained at least the first jhāna but does not experience any of the psychic powers that sometimes can be accessed through jhāna.</p>
