Ānanda was staying near Kosambī at Ghosita's monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Udāyin went to him and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Ānanda, "This has been said by Pañcālacaṇḍa the deva's son:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'Truly in a confining place, he found an opening  — <br />

							the awakened one who awakened through jhāna,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							the chief bull, withdrawn,<br />

					<p>"Now which, my friend, is the confining place?</p>

					<p class="f4">And which opening in the confining place is the Blessed One said to have attained?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Ven. Ānanda:] "The five strings of sensuality, my friend, are described by the Blessed One as a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire;</p>

					<p class="f4">sounds cognizable via the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">smells cognizable via the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">tastes cognizable via the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">tactile sensations cognizable via the body — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">These five strings of sensuality are described by the Blessed One as a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now there is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">For even there, there's a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the confining place there?</p>

					<p class="f4">Just that <i>directed thought and evaluation</i> have not ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">For even there, there's a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just that <i>rapture</i> has not ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the fading of rapture, remains in equanimity, mindful and alert, senses pleasure with the body, and enters and remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">For even there, there's a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is the confining place there?</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, though followed by a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">For even there, there's a confining place.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just that <i>the perception of form</i> has not ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the confining place there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' enters and remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then there is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even this much is described by the Blessed One as the attaining of an opening in a confining place, without a sequel."</p>

					<p>Bhkkhu Thanissaro Notes here: The following three discourses show that, contrary to a popular misconception, the phrase, "Released through discernment" does not refer to a person who has attained release without experience of the jhānas. Instead, it refers to a person who has attained at least the first jhāna but does not experience any of the psychic powers that sometimes can be accessed through jhāna.</p>
