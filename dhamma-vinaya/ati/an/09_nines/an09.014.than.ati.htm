					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Sāriputta said to him, "Based on what, Samiddhi, do thoughts and resolves arise in a person?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Based on name and form, sir."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And how do they go to multiplicity?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Through the properties, sir."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their origination?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have contact as their origination, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their meeting place?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have feeling as their meeting place, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their presiding state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have concentration as their presiding state, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their governing principle?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have mindfulness as their governing principle, sir."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their surpassing state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have discernment as their surpassing state, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do they have as their heartwood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"They have release as their heartwood, sir."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And where do they gain their footing?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"They gain their footing in the deathless, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Samiddhi, on being asked, 'Based on what do thoughts and resolves arise in a person?' you have answered, 'Based on name and form.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And how do they go to multiplicity?' you have answered, 'Through the properties.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their origination?' you have answered, 'They have contact as their origination.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their meeting place?' you have answered, 'They have feeling as their meeting place.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their presiding state?' you have answered, 'They have concentration as their presiding state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their governing principle?' you have answered, 'They have mindfulness as their governing principle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their surpassing state?' you have answered, 'They have discernment as their surpassing state.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And what do they have as their heartwood?' you have answered, 'They have release as their heartwood.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When asked, 'And where do they gain their footing?' you have answered, 'They gain their footing in the deathless.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very good, Samiddhi, very good. It's good, the way you have answered when questioned, but don't get conceited about that."</p>
