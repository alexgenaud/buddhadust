					<p class="f4">When elephants &amp; cow-elephants &amp; calf-elephants &amp; baby elephants devour the wilderness tusker's bunches of branches, he feels irritated, upset, &amp; disgusted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When elephants &amp; cow-elephants &amp; calf-elephants &amp; baby elephants go ahead of the wilderness tusker on his way down to his bath and stir up the mud in the water with their trunks, he feels irritated, upset, &amp; disgusted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When cow-elephants go along as the wilderness tusker is bathing and bang up against his body, he feels irritated, upset, &amp; disgusted.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then the thought occurs to the wilderness tusker, 'I now live hemmed in by elephants &amp; cow-elephants &amp; calf-elephants &amp; baby elephants.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I feed off grass with broken-off tips.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My bunches of branches are devoured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I drink muddied water.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even when I bathe, cow-elephants go along and bang up against my body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What if I were to live alone, apart from the crowd?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"So at a later time he lives alone, apart from the crowd.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He feeds off grass with unbroken tips.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">His bunches of branches are undevoured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He drinks unmuddied water.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When he bathes, cow-elephants don't go along and bang up against his body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The thought occurs to him, 'Before, I lived hemmed in by elephants &amp; cow-elephants &amp; calf-elephants &amp; baby elephants.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I fed off grass with broken-off tips.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My bunches of branches were devoured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I drank muddied water.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Even when I bathed, cow-elephants would go along and bang up against my body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But now I live alone, apart from the crowd.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I feed off grass with unbroken tips.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">My bunches of branches are undevoured.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I drink unmuddied water.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When I bathe, cow-elephants don't go along and bang up against my body.' Breaking off a branch with his trunk and scratching his body with it, gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, when a monk lives hemmed in with monks, nuns, male &amp; female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, &amp; their disciples, the thought occurs to him, 'I now live hemmed in by monks, nuns, male &amp; female lay followers, kings, royal ministers, sectarians, &amp; their disciples.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What if I were to live alone, apart from the crowd?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"So he seeks out a secluded dwelling: a wilderness, the shade of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a charnel ground, a forest grove, the open air, a heap of straw.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and brings mindfulness to the fore.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Abandoning covetousness with regard to the world, he dwells with an awareness devoid of covetousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He cleanses his mind of covetousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Abandoning ill will and anger, he dwells with an awareness devoid of ill will, sympathetic with the welfare of all living beings.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He cleanses his mind of ill will and anger.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Abandoning sloth and drowsiness, he dwells with an awareness devoid of sloth and drowsiness, mindful, alert, percipient of light.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He cleanses his mind of sloth and drowsiness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Abandoning restlessness and anxiety, he dwells undisturbed, his mind inwardly stilled.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He cleanses his mind of restlessness and anxiety.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Abandoning uncertainty, he dwells having crossed over uncertainty, with no perplexity with regard to skillful mental qualities.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He cleanses his mind of uncertainty.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Having abandoned these five hindrances—corruptions of awareness that weaken discernment—then quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, he enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the stilling of directed thoughts &amp; evaluations, he enters &amp; remains in the second jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp; evaluation—internal assurance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, &amp; alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He enters &amp; remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.' Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain—as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress—he enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the complete transcending of perceptions of (physical) form, with the disappearance of perceptions of resistance, and not attending to perceptions of multiplicity, (perceiving,) 'Infinite space,' he enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of space.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of space, (perceiving,) 'Infinite consciousness,' he enters &amp; remains in the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, (perceiving,) 'There is nothing,' he enters &amp; remains in the dimension of nothingness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the complete transcending of the dimension of nothingness, he enters &amp; remains in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"With the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Gratified, he allays his itch."</p>
