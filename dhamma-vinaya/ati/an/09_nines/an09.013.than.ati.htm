					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sāriputta,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it the case, friend Sāriputta, that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the purpose, 'May an action [whose result] is to be experienced in the here-and-now be turned into an action [whose result] is to be experienced by me in a future life?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, my friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then is it the case, friend Sāriputta, that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the purpose, 'May an action [whose result] is to be experienced in a future life be turned into an action [whose result] is to be experienced by me in the here-and-now?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, my friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then is it the case, friend Sāriputta, that the holy life is lived under the Blessed One with the purpose, 'May an action [whose result] is to be experienced as pleasure be turned into an action [whose result] is to be experienced by me as pain?'"</p>

					<p class="f4">So, then, with what purpose <i>is</i> the holy life lived under the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The holy life, my friend, is lived under the Blessed One with the purpose of knowing, seeing, attaining, realizing, and breaking through to what has been unknown, unseen, unattained, unrealized, and not broken through to."</p>
