					<p class="f4">[Ven. Ānanda:] "There is the case, my friend, where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhāna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">the dimension of nothingness...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters &amp; remains in the cessation of perception &amp; feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment without a sequel."</p>
