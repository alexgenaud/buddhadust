Udāyin:] "'Released through discernment, released through discernment,' it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent is one described by the Blessed One as released through discernment?"</p>

					<p class="f4">[Ven. Ānanda:] "There is the case, my friend, where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, with the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhāna...</p>

					<p class="f4">the third jhāna...</p>

					<p class="f4">the fourth jhāna...</p>

					<p class="f4">the dimension of the infinitude of space...</p>

					<p class="f4">the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness...</p>

					<p class="f4">the dimension of nothingness...</p>

					<p class="f4">the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment, though with a sequel.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, with the complete transcending of the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, he enters and remains in the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as he sees (that) with discernment, effluents are completely ended.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he knows it through discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's to this extent that one is described by the Blessed One as released through discernment without a sequel."</p>
