							<p>Bhk. Thanissaro, in an earlier version of this translation notes: In <a href='an09.034.than.ati.htm'>AN 9.34</a>, the "affliction" of the third jhāna that is abandoned in the fourth jhāna is said to be equanimity. However, the fourth jhāna also contains equanimity. Thus the statement in this sutta &mdash; that the <i>pleasure</i> of equanimity is abandoned in the fourth jhāna &mdash; seems more consistent with the fourth jhāna as described in the standard formula. <a href='an09.042.than.ati.htm'>AN 9.42</a> is in agreement with this sutta on this point.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This observation—that the <i>pleasure</i> of equanimity is abandoned in the fourth jhāna—is also found in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_2.htm#p66">MN 66</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p42">AN 9:42.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> "Resistance" is a translation of the Pali term, <i>paṭigha.</i> According to <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15,</a> resistance-contact results from the characteristics of form and allows mental activity to know the presence of form. In other words, if form did not put up resistance to something else taking its place, one would not know that form is present. Thus, the disappearance of perceptions of resistance aids in the mind’s ability to transcend perceptions of form and to sense, in its place, infinite space.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> "Multiplicity" is a translation of the Pali term, <i>nānattā.</i> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p137">MN 137</a> identifies multiplicity as the input of the five physical senses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Notice that this description of the cessation of perception &amp; feeling lacks the statement often added in passages where this attainment is described: "and, having seen [that] with discernment, his effluents are completely ended."</p>
