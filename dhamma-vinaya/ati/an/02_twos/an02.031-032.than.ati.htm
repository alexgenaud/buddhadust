					<p class="f4">Which two?</p>

					<p class="f4">Your mother and father.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if you were to carry your mother on one shoulder and your father on the other shoulder for 100 years, and were to look after them by anointing, massaging, bathing, and rubbing their limbs, and they were to defecate and urinate right there [on your shoulders], you would not in that way pay or repay your parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">If you were to establish your mother and father in absolute sovereignty over this great earth, abounding in the seven treasures, you would not in that way pay or repay your parents.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mother and father do much for their children.</p>

					<p class="f4">They care for them, they nourish them, they introduce them to this world.</p>

					<p class="f4">But anyone who rouses his unbelieving mother and father,<br />
					settles and establishes them in conviction;<br />
					rouses his unvirtuous mother and father,<br />
					settles and establishes them in virtue;<br />
					rouses his stingy mother and father,<br />
					settles and establishes them in generosity;<br />
					rouses his foolish mother and father,<br />
					settles and establishes them in discernment:</p>

					<p class="f4">To this extent one pays and repays one's mother and father."</p>
