Maha Kaccana</a> was staying at <a id="madhura">Madhura</a> in the <a id="gunda">Gunda</a> Forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Kandarayana the brahman went to Ven. Maha Kaccana<br />
					and on arrival exchanged courteous greetings with him.<br />
					After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies,<br />
					he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Maha Kaccana,</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have heard it said, Master Kaccana, that,<br />
					'Kaccana the contemplative<br />
					does not raise his hands in respect<br />
					to aged, venerable brahmans<br />
					— advanced in years,<br />
					come to the last stage of life —<br />
					nor does he rise up to greet them,<br />
					nor does he offer them a seat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Insofar as you don't raise your hands in respect<br />
					to aged, venerable brahmans<br />
					— advanced in years,<br />
					come to the last stage of life —<br />
					nor rise up to greet them,<br />
					nor offer them a seat,<br />
					that is simply not right, Master Kaccana."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, the Blessed One<br />
					— the one who knows,<br />
					the one who sees,<br />
					worthy and<br />
					rightly self-awakened —<br />
					has declared the level of one who is venerable<br />
					and the level of one who is a youngster.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if one is venerable<br />
					— 80, 90, 100 years old —<br />
					yet if one partakes of sensuality,<br />
					lives in the midst of sensuality,<br />
					burns with sensual fever,<br />
					is chewed up by sensual thoughts,<br />
					and is eager in the search for sensuality,<br />
					then one is reckoned simply as a young fool,<br />
					not an elder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if one is a youngster, youthful<br />
					— a black-haired young person<br />
					endowed with the blessings of youth<br />
					in the first stage of life —<br />
					yet does not partake of sensuality,<br />
					does not live in the midst of sensuality,<br />
					does not burn with sensual fever,<br />
					is not chewed up by sensual thoughts,<br />
					and is not eager in the search for sensuality,<br />
					then one is reckoned as a wise elder."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said,<br />
					Kandarayana the brahman rose up from his seat,<br />
					arranged his cloak over one shoulder,<br />
					and bowed down at the feet<br />
					of the monks who were youngsters, [saying,]<br />
					"You, sirs, are the venerable ones,<br />
					standing on the level of those who are venerable.<br />
					We are the youngsters,<br />
					standing on the level of those who are youngsters.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Kaccana! Magnificent!<br />
					Just as if he were to place upright<br />
					what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way<br />
					to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has Master Kaccana<br />
					— through many lines of reasoning —<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to Master Gotama for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the community of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Kaccana remember me<br />
					as a lay follower who has gone for refuge<br />
					from this day forward, for life."</p>
