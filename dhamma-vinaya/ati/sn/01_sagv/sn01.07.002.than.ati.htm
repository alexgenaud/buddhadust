					<p class="f4">Then the brahman <a id="akkosaka">Akkosaka</a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Bharadvaja heard that a brahman of the Bharadvaja clan had gone forth from the home life into homelessness in the presence of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Angered and displeased, he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, insulted and cursed him with rude, harsh words.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Blessed One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, brahman:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to you as guests?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, Master Gotama, sometimes friends and colleagues, relatives and kinsmen come to me as guests."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what do you think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sometimes I serve them with staple and non-staple foods and delicacies."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if they don't accept them, to whom do those foods belong?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If they don't accept them, Master Gotama, those foods are all mine."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, brahman,<br />
					that with which you have insulted me,<br />
					who is not insulting;<br />
					that with which you have taunted me,<br />
					who is not taunting;<br />
					that with which you have berated me,<br />
					who is not berating:<br />
					that I don't accept from you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's all yours, brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's all yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whoever returns insult<br />
					to one who is insulting,<br />
					returns taunts to one who is taunting,<br />
					returns a berating to one who is berating,<br />
					is said to be eating together,<br />
					sharing company with that person.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I am neither eating together<br />
					nor sharing your company, brahman.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's all yours.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's all yours."</p>

					<p class="f4">"The king together with his court know this of Master Gotama —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Gotama the contemplative is an arahant'<br />
					— and yet still Master Gotama gets angry."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i></p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Whence is there anger<br />
							for one free from anger,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tamed,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; living in tune — <br />
							one released through right knowing,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calmed<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Such.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">You make things worse<br />
							when you flare up<br />
							at someone who's angry.<br />
							Whoever doesn't flare up<br />
							at someone who's angry<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wins a battle<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to win.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">You live for the good of both<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — your own, the other's — <br />
							when, knowing the other's provoked,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you mindfully grow calm.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">When you work the cure of both<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — your own, the other's — <br />
							those who think you a fool<br />
							know nothing of Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has Master Gotama<br />
					— through many lines of reasoning —<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the community of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let me obtain the going forth in Master Gotama's presence,<br />
					let me obtain admission."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the brahman Akkosaka Bharadvaja received the going forth and the admission in the Blessed One's presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And not long after his admission<br />
					— dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute —<br />
					he in no long time reached and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life,<br />
					for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness,<br />
					knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for the sake of this world."</p>

					<p class="f4">And so Ven. Bharadvaja became another one of the Arahants.</p>
