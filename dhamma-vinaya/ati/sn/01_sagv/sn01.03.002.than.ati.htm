Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, what qualities, arising in a man, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Three qualities, great king, arising in a man, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort. Which three?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Greed is a quality that, arising in a man, arises for his harm, suffering, and discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Aversion is a quality that, arising in a man, arises for his harm, suffering, and discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Delusion is a quality that, arising in a man, arises for his harm, suffering, and discomfort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"These are the three qualities, great king, that, arising in a man, arise for his harm, suffering, and discomfort."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Greed, aversion, and delusion<br />
					arisen from within oneself,<br />
					destroy the man of evil awareness,<br />
					like its own fruit, the reed."</p>
