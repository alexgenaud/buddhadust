					<p class="f4">Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, raising a fourfold army, marched toward <a id="kasi">Kasi</a> against <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a>.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi heard, "King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, they say, has raised a fourfold army and is marching toward Kasi against me."</p>

					<p class="f4">So King Pasenadi, raising a fourfold army, launched a counter-attack toward Kasi against King Ajatasattu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Ajatasattu and King Pasenadi fought a battle, and in that battle King Ajatasattu defeated King Pasenadi.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi, defeated, marched back to his capital at Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Sāvatthi for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having gone for alms in Sāvatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord, King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, raising a fourfold army, marched toward Kasi against King Pasenadi Kosala.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi heard, 'King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, they say, has raised a fourfold army and is marching toward Kasi against me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So King Pasenadi, raising a fourfold army, launched a counter-attack toward Kasi against King Ajatasattu.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then King Ajatasattu and King Pasenadi fought a battle, and in that battle King Ajatasattu defeated King Pasenadi.</p>

					<p class="f4">King Pasenadi, defeated, marched back to his capital at Sāvatthi."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, King Ajatasattu has evil friends, evil comrades, evil companions, whereas King Pasenadi has fine friends, fine comrades, fine companions. Yet for now, King Pasenadi will lie down tonight in pain, defeated."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Winning gives birth to hostility.<br />
					Losing, one lies down in pain.<br />
					The calmed lie down with ease,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having set<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; winning and losing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; aside.</p>
