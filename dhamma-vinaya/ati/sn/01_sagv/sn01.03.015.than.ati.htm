					<p class="f4">Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, raising a fourfold army, marched toward <a id="kasi">Kasi</a> against <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a>. King Pasenadi heard, "King Ajatasattu of Magadha, the son of Queen Videha, they say, has raised a fourfold army and is marching toward Kasi against me." So King Pasenadi, raising a fourfold army, launched a counter-attack toward Kasi against King Ajatasattu. Then King Ajatasattu and King Pasenadi fought a battle, and in that battle King Pasenadi defeated King Ajatasattu and captured him alive.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought then occurred to King Pasenadi:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even though King Ajatasattu has wronged me when I have done him no wrong, still he is my nephew. What if I, having confiscated all his elephant troops, all his cavalry, all his chariots, and all his infantry, were to let him go with just his life?" So King Pasenadi — having confiscated all his elephant troops, cavalry, chariots, and infantry — let King Ajatasattu go with just his life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then in the early morning, a large number of monks, having put on their robes and carrying their bowls and outer robes, went into Sāvatthi for alms. Having gone for alms in Sāvatthi, after the meal, returning from their alms round, they went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, they [reported these events to the Blessed One].</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, on realizing the significance of that, the Blessed One on that occasion exclaimed:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">A man may plunder<br />
					as long as it serves his ends,<br />
					but when others are plundered,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who has plundered<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets plundered in turn.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">A fool thinks,<br />
					'Now's my chance,'<br />
					as long as his evil<br />
					has yet to ripen.<br />
					But when it ripens,<br />
					the fool<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; falls<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; into pain.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Killing, you gain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your killer.<br />
					Conquering, you gain one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who will conquer you;<br />
					insulting, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insult;<br />
					harassing, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; harassment.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">And so, through the cycle of action,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he who has plundered<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gets plundered in turn.</p>
