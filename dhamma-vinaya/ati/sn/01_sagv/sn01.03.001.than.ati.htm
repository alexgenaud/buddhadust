Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After this exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>
					<p class="f4">"Now then, does Master Gotama claim,<br />
					'I have awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If, great king, one speaking rightly could say of anyone,<br />
					'He has awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening,'<br />
					one could rightly say that of me.<br />
					For I, great king, have awakened to the unexcelled right self-awakening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But Master Gotama,<br />
					those priests and contemplatives<br />
					each with his group,<br />
					each with his community,<br />
					each the teacher of his group,<br />
					an honored leader,<br />
					well-regarded by people at large — i.e.,<br />
					Purana Kassapa,<br />
					Makkhali Gosala,<br />
					Ajita Kesakambalin,<br />
					Pakudha Kaccayana,<br />
					Sañjaya Belatthaputta,<br />
					and the Nigantha Nathaputta:<br />
					even they,<br />
					when I asked them whether they claimed to have awakened<br />
					to the unexcelled right self-awakening,<br />
					didn't make that claim.<br />
					So who is Master Gotama to do so<br />
					when he is still young and newly gone-forth?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are these four things, great king,<br />
					that shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young.</p>
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">A noble warrior, great king,<br />
					shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young.</p>
					<p class="f4">A snake, great king,<br />
					shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young.</p>
					<p class="f4">A fire, great king,<br />
					shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young.</p>
					<p class="f4">And a monk shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young.</p>
					<p class="f4">These are the four things<br />
					that shouldn't be despised and disparaged<br />
					for being young."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Having said that,<br />
					the One Well-Gone,<br />
					the Teacher,<br />
					said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">You shouldn't look down on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — for being young — <br />
					a noble warrior of consummate birth,<br />
					a high-born prince of great status.<br />
					A person shouldn't disparage him.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For it's possible<br />
					that this lord of human beings,<br />
					this noble warrior,<br />
					will gain the throne<br />
					and, angered at that disparagement,<br />
					come down harshly<br />
					with his royal might.<br />
					So, guarding your life,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid him.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">You shouldn't look down on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — for being young — <br />
					a serpent you meet<br />
					in village or wilderness:<br />
					A person shouldn't disparage it.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">As that potent snake slithers along<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with vibrant colors,<br />
					it may someday burn the fool,<br />
					whether woman or man.<br />
					So, guarding your life,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid it.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">You shouldn't look down on<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — for being young — <br />
					a blaze that feeds on many things,<br />
					a flame with its blackened trail:<br />
					A person shouldn't disparage it.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">For if it gains sustenance,<br />
					becoming a great mass of flame,<br />
					it may someday burn the fool,<br />
					whether woman or man.<br />
					So, guarding your life,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; avoid it.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">When a fire burns down a forest<br />
					— that flame with its blackened trail — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shoots there<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; take birth once more<br />
					with the passage of days and nights.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But if a monk,<br />
					his virtue consummate,<br />
					burns you with his potency,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
					you won't acquire sons or cattle<br />
					nor will your heirs enjoy wealth.<br />
					They become &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; barren,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; heir-less,<br />
					like palm tree stumps.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">So a person who's wise,<br />
					out of regard for his own good,<br />
					should always show due respect<br />
					for &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a serpent,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a fire,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a noble warrior with high status,<br />
					and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a monk, his virtue consummate.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One:<br />
					"Magnificent, lord!<br />
					Magnificent!<br />
					Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way<br />
					to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has the Blessed One<br />
					— through many lines of reasoning —<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the Community of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>The "potency" of a virtuous monk is his unwillingness to seek redress when he has been treated wrongly. The bad kamma of having mistreated a monk pure in his virtue is what returns to burn the person who did it.</p>
