					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning, the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">The brahman Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a second time, [on the next day,] the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time, the brahman Udaya filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a third time, [on the following day,] the Blessed One, having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe, went to the home of the brahman Udaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time, the brahman Udaya, having filled the Blessed One's bowl with rice, said to him, "This pesky Gotama contemplative keeps coming again and again."</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">The Buddha:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">"Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they sow the seed.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the deva-kings rain.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; farmers plow the fields.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grain comes to the kingdom.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beggars wander.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lords of giving give.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; having given, the lords of giving<br />
							again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; go to a heavenly place.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dairy farmers draw milk.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the calf goes to its mother.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; one wearies and trembles.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dullard goes to the womb.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you take birth and die.<br />
							Again and again &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; they carry you to the charnel ground.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">But on gaining the path<br />
							to no again-becoming,<br />
							you, deep in discernment,<br />
							don't take birth<br />
							again and again."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the brahman Udaya said to the Blessed One, "Magnificent, Master Gotama!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
