Then, as he was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in his awareness: "Is it possible to exercise rulership without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow — righteously?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="mara">Then</a> Mara, the Evil One, knowing with his awareness the train of thought in the Blessed One's awareness, went to him and on arrival said to him: "Exercise rulership, Blessed One! Exercise rulership, O One Well-gone! — without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow — righteously!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what do you see in me, Evil One, that you say to me, 'Exercise rulership, Blessed One! Exercise rulership, O One Well-gone! — without killing or causing others to kill, without confiscating or causing others to confiscate, without sorrowing or causing others sorrow — righteously!'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, the Blessed One has developed the four bases of power, pursued them, handed them the reins and taken them as a basis, given them a grounding, steadied them, consolidated them, and undertaken them well. If he wanted to, he could resolve on the Himalayas, king of mountains, as gold, and it would become a mountain of gold."</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[The Buddha:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><a id="gold">The</a> entirety<br />
					of a mountain of gold,<br />
					of solid bullion:<br />
					even twice that<br />
					wouldn't suffice<br />
					for one person.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing this,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; live evenly,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in tune with the contemplative life.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">When you see stress,<br />
					and from where it comes,<br />
					how can you incline<br />
					to sensual pleasures?<br />
					Knowing acquisition<br />
					to be a bond in the world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; train for<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its subduing.</p>
					<p class="f4">Then Mara the Evil One — sad and dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me; the One Well-gone knows me" — vanished right there.</p>
