There he addressed the monks: "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord!" the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said: "Once, monks, the devas and asuras were arrayed for battle. Then <a id="sakka">Sakka</a>, lord of the devas, addressed the devas of the Thirty-three: 'If, dear sirs, when the devas are engaged in battle, there should arise fear, terror, or horripilation, then on that occasion you should look up at the top of my standard. For when you look up at the top of my standard, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'If you don't look up at the top of my standard, then you should look up at the top of the standard of <a id="pajapati">Pajapati</a> the deva-king. For when you look up at the top of the standard of Pajapati the deva-king, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'If you don't look up at the top of the standard of Pajapati the deva-king, then you should look up at the top of the standard of <a id="varuna">Varuna</a> the deva-king. For when you look up at the top of the standard of Varuna the deva-king, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'If you don't look up at the top of the standard of Varuna the deva-king, then you should look up at the top of the standard of Isana the deva-king. For when you look up at the top of the standard of <a id="isana">Isana</a> the deva-king, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, in those who look up at the top of the standard of Sakka, lord of the devas; in those who look up at the top of the standard of Pajapati the deva-king; in those who look up at the top of the standard of Varuna, the deva-king; or in those who look up at the top of the standard of Isana, the deva-king, any fear, terror, or horripilation they may have might be abandoned, or it might not. Why is that? Because Sakka, lord of the devas, is not free of passion, free of aversion, or free of delusion. He can be frightened, terrorized, cowardly, quick to flee.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="nofear1">But</a>, monks, I tell you this: If, when you have gone to the wilderness, to the foot of a tree, or to an empty dwelling, there should arise fear, terror, or horripilation, then on that occasion you should recollect me thus: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, knower of the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of those who can be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.' For when you recollect me, monks, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="nofear2">If you</a> don't recollect me, then you should recollect the Dhamma thus: 'The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting one to come and see, pertinent, to be seen by the wise for themselves.' For when you recollect the Dhamma, monks, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="nofear3">If you</a> cannot recollect the Dhamma, then you should recollect the Saṇgha thus: 'The Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well, practiced straightforwardly, practice methodically, practiced masterfully, i. e., the four pairs, the eight-types [of Noble Ones]: that is the Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples — worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the unexcelled field of merit for the world.' For when you recollect the Saṇgha, monks, any fear, terror, or horripilation you may have will be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is that? Because the Tathāgata, worthy and rightly self-awakened, is free of passion, free of aversion, free of delusion. He is fearless, cannot be terrorized, bold, not quick to flee."</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">In wilderness, monks,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the foot of a tree,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or in an empty dwelling,<br />
					recollect the Buddha:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have no fear.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">If you don't recall the Buddha — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; best in the world,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the bull of men — <br />
					then recollect the Dhamma,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading outward,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well expounded.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">If you don't recall the Dhamma — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; leading outward,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well expounded — <br />
					then recollect the Saṇgha,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the field of merit<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unexcelled.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">For those who have thus recalled<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Buddha,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dhamma,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Saṇgha, monks,<br />
					there will be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no terror,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; horripilation, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or fear.</p>
