					when the Blessed One was newly Self-awakened,<br />
					he was staying at <a id="Uruvela">Uruvela</a> on the bank of the <a id="neranjara">Nerañjara</a> River,<br />
					at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, while he was alone and in seclusion,<br />
					this line of thinking arose in his awareness:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This Dhamma that I have attained is deep,<br />
					hard to see,<br />
					hard to realize,<br />
					peaceful,<br />
					refined,<br />
					beyond the scope of conjecture,<br />
					subtle,<br />
					to-be-experienced by the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">But this generation delights in attachment,<br />
					is excited by attachment,<br />
					enjoys attachment.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a generation delighting in attachment,<br />
					excited by attachment,<br />
					enjoying attachment,<br />
					this/that conditionality<br />
					and dependent co-arising<br />
					are hard to see.</p>

					<p class="f4">This state, too, is hard to see:<br />
					the resolution of all fabrications,<br />
					the relinquishment of all acquisitions,<br />
					the ending of craving;<br />
					dispassion;<br />
					cessation;<br />
					Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if I were to teach the Dhamma<br />
					and if others would not understand me,<br />
					that would be tiresome for me,<br />
					troublesome for me."</p>

					<p class="f4">Just then these verses,<br />
					unspoken in the past,<br />
					unheard before,<br />
					occurred to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Enough now with teaching<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; what<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only with difficulty<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I reached.<br />
					This Dhamma is not easily realized<br />
					by those overcome<br />
					with aversion and passion.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">What is abstruse, subtle,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; deep,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to see,<br />
					going against the flow — <br />
					those delighting in passion,<br />
					cloaked in the mass of darkness,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; won't see.</p>

					<p class="f4">As the Blessed One reflected thus,<br />
					his mind inclined to dwelling at ease,<br />
					not to teaching the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="sahampati">Brahmā Sahampati</a>,<br />
					having known with his own awareness the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness, thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The world is lost!</p>

					<p class="f4">The world is destroyed!</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of the Tathāgata,<br />
					the Arahant,<br />
					the Rightly Self-awakened One<br />
					inclines to dwelling at ease,<br />
					not to teaching the Dhamma!"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm<br />
					or flex his extended arm,<br />
					Brahmā Sahampati disappeared from the Brahmā-world<br />
					and reappeared in front the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder,<br />
					he knelt down with his right knee on the ground,<br />
					saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the One-Well-Gone teach the Dhamma!</p>

					<p class="f4">There are beings with little dust in their eyes<br />
					who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Brahmā Sahampati said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that, he further said this:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the past<br />
					there appeared among the Magadhans<br />
					an impure Dhamma<br />
					devised by the stained.<br />
					Throw open the door to the Deathless!<br />
					Let them hear the Dhamma<br />
					realized by the Stainless One!<br /></p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Just as one standing on a rocky crag<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; might see people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all around below,<br />
					So, O wise one, with all-around vision,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ascend the palace<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fashioned of the Dhamma.<br />
					Free from sorrow, behold the people<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; submerged in sorrow,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oppressed by birth and aging.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Rise up, hero, victor in battle!<br />
					O Teacher, wander without debt in the world.<br />
					Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:<br />
					There will be those who will understand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One,<br />
					having understood Brahmā's invitation,<br />
					out of compassion for beings,<br />
					surveyed the world with the eye of an Awakened One.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he did so,<br />
					he saw beings with little dust in their eyes<br />
					and those with much,<br />
					those with keen faculties<br />
					and those with dull,<br />
					those with good attributes<br />
					and those with bad,<br />
					those easy to teach<br />
					and those hard,<br />
					some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses,<br />
					some lotuses<br />
					— born and growing in the water —<br />
					might flourish while immersed in the water,<br />
					without rising up from the water;<br />
					some might stand at an even level with the water;<br />
					while some might rise up from the water<br />
					and stand without being smeared by the water —<br />
					so too, surveying the world with the eye of an Awakened One,<br />
					the Blessed One saw beings<br />
					with little dust in their eyes<br />
					and those with much,<br />
					those with keen faculties<br />
					and those with dull,<br />
					those with good attributes<br />
					and those with bad,<br />
					those easy to teach<br />
					and those hard,<br />
					some of them seeing disgrace and danger in the other world.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having seen this,<br />
					he answered Brahmā Sahampati in verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Open are the doors to the Deathless<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to those with ears.<br />
					Let them show their conviction.<br />
					Perceiving trouble, O Brahmā,<br />
					I did not tell people the refined,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sublime Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahmā Sahampati, thinking, "The Blessed One has given his consent to teach of Dhamma,"<br />
					bowed down to the Blessed One and,<br />
					circling him on the right,<br />
					disappeared right there.</p>
