					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, <a id="pasenadi">King Pasenadi Kosala</a> said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Where, lord, should a gift be given?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wherever the mind feels confidence, great king."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But a gift given where, lord, bears great fruit?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"This [question] is one thing, great king<br />
					— 'Where should a gift be given?' —<br />
					while this<br />
					— 'A gift given where bears great fruit?' —<br />
					is something else entirely.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is given to a virtuous person<br />
					— rather than to an unvirtuous one —<br />
					bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that case, great king,<br />
					I will ask you a counter-question.<br />
					Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, great king?<br />
					There is the case where you have a war at hand,<br />
					a battle imminent.<br />
					A noble-warrior youth would come along<br />
					— untrained, unpracticed, undisciplined,<br />
					undrilled, fearful, terrified,<br />
					cowardly, quick to flee.<br />
					Would you take him on?<br />
					Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I wouldn't take him on.<br />
					I wouldn't have any use for a man like that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then a brahman youth...<br />
					a merchant youth...<br />
					a laborer youth would come along<br />
					— untrained, unpracticed, undisciplined,<br />
					undrilled, fearful, terrified,<br />
					cowardly, quick to flee.<br />
					Would you take him on?<br />
					Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I wouldn't take him on.<br />
					I wouldn't have any use for a man like that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what do you think, great king?<br />
					There is the case where you have a war at hand,<br />
					a battle imminent.<br />
					A noble-warrior youth would come along<br />
					— trained, practiced, disciplined,<br />
					drilled, fearless, unterrified,<br />
					not cowardly, not quick to flee.<br />
					Would you take him on?<br />
					Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, I would take him on.<br />
					I would have use for a man like that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then a brahman youth...<br />
					a merchant youth...<br />
					a laborer youth would come along<br />
					— trained, practiced, disciplined, drilled,<br />
					fearless, unterrified, not cowardly,<br />
					not quick to flee.<br />
					Would you take him on?<br />
					Would you have any use for a man like that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord, I would take him on.<br />
					I would have use for a man like that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, great king.<br />
					When someone has gone forth from the home life<br />
					into homelessness<br />
					— no matter from what clan —<br />
					and he has abandoned five factors<br />
					and is endowed with five,<br />
					what is given to him bears great fruit.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="p5lost">And which</a> five factors<br />
					has he abandoned?<br />
					He has abandoned sensual desire...<br />
					ill will...<br />
					sloth and drowsiness...<br />
					restlessness and anxiety...<br />
					uncertainty.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the five factors he has abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5gained">And with</a> which five factors is he endowed?<br />
					He is endowed with the aggregate of virtue<br />
					of one beyond training...<br />
					the aggregate of concentration<br />
					of one beyond training...<br />
					the aggregate of discernment<br />
					of one beyond training...<br />
					the aggregate of release<br />
					of one beyond training...<br />
					the aggregate of knowledge and vision of release<br />
					of one beyond training.<br />
					These are the five factors with which he is endowed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is given to one<br />
					who has abandoned five factors<br />
					and is endowed with five factors<br />
					in this way<br />
					bears great fruit."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Having said that,<br />
					the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"As a king intent on battle<br />
					would hire a youth<br />
					in whom there are<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; archery skills,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; persistence,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and strength,<br />
					and not, on the basis of birth,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a coward;<br />
					so, too, you should honor<br />
					a person of noble conduct, wise,<br />
					in whom are established<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; composure<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and patience,<br />
					even though<br />
					his birth may be lowly.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Let donors build<br />
					pleasant hermitages<br />
					and there invite the learned to stay.<br />
					Let them make reservoirs<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in dry forests<br />
					and walking paths<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where it's rough<br />
					Let them, with a clear, calm awareness,<br />
					give food, drink, snacks,<br />
					clothing, and lodgings<br />
					to those who've become<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; straightforward.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><a id="thunder">Just as</a> a hundred-peaked,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lightning-garlanded,<br />
					thundering cloud,<br />
					raining on the fertile earth,<br />
					fills the plateaus and gullies,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even so<br />
					a person of conviction and learning,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wise,<br />
					having stored up provisions,<br />
					satisfies wayfarers<br />
					with food and drink.<br />
					Delighting in distributing alms,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Give to them!<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Give!'<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he says.<br />
					That<br />
					is his thunder,<br />
					like a raining cloud's.<br />
					That shower of merit,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; abundant,<br />
					rains back on the one<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who gives."</p>
