					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p><i>Many discourses are set in Jeta's Grove, the monastery donated by Anāthapiṇḍika. Here we learn how Anāthapiṇḍika first met the Buddha. A dramatic point in the story revolves around the fact that most people knew of him by his epithet — Anāthapiṇḍika means "Almsgiver to those without protection" — rather than by his given name. Thus he is surprised to hear the Buddha, at their first meeting, address him correctly.</i></p>
					
					<p><i>The Cullavagga (VI) gives this same story in greater detail and adds more incidents: After reciting the verse with which this discourse ends, the Buddha gives Anāthapiṇḍika a step-by-step teaching, culminating in an explanation of the four noble truths. At the end of the teaching, Anāthapiṇḍika attains stream-entry. He then returns home to Sāvatthi, purchases a grove from Prince Jeta at immense price, and establishes a monastery for the Buddha and the Saŋgha. There, according to the commentaries, the Buddha spent more rains retreats than at any other monastery.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Anāthapiṇḍika the householder had arrived in Rājagaha on some business.</p>

					<p class="f4">He heard, "An Awakened One, they say, has appeared in the world," and he wanted to go right then to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to him, "Today is not the proper time to go to see the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tomorrow I will go to see the Blessed One at the proper time."</p>

					<p class="f4">With his mindfulness immersed in the Awakened One he lay down to sleep.</p>

					<p class="f4">Three times he got up during the night, thinking it was light.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went to the gate to the charnel ground. Non-human beings opened the gate.</p>

					<p class="f4">When Anāthapiṇḍika the householder had left the city, the light vanished and darkness appeared.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fear, terror, and horripilation arose, and because of that he wanted to turn back.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sivaka the yakkha-spirit, invisible, proclaimed:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">"A hundred elephants,<br />
							a hundred horses,<br />
							a hundred mule-drawn carts,<br />
							a hundred-thousand maidens<br />
							adorned with jewels and earrings<br />
							aren’t worth one-sixteenth<br />
							of one step forward.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Go forward, householder!<br />
							Go forward, householder!<br />
							Going forward is better for you,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not back!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The darkness then vanished for Anāthapiṇḍika and the light appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fear, terror, and horripilation he had felt subsided.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For a second time... a third time, the light vanished and darkness appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Fear, terror, and horripilation arose, and because of that Anāthapiṇḍika wanted to turn back.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then for a third time, Sivaka the yakkha-spirit, invisible, proclaimed:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">"A hundred elephants,<br />
							a hundred horses,<br />
							a hundred mule-drawn carts,<br />
							a hundred-thousand maidens<br />

					      <p class="f4 in2">Go forward, householder!<br />

					<p class="f4">The darkness then vanished for Anāthapiṇḍika and the light appeared.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The fear, terror, and horripilation he had felt subsided.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So Anāthapiṇḍika went to the Cool Forest.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time, the Blessed One—having gotten up as the night was ending—was pacing back and forth in the open air.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He saw Anāthapiṇḍika the householder coming from afar.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On seeing him, he got down from his meditation path and sat on a seat made ready.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to Anāthapiṇḍika, "Come, Sudatta."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Anāthapiṇḍika, (thinking,) "The Blessed One is calling me by my given name!" threw himself down right there at the Blessed One’s feet and said to him, "Lord, I hope the Blessed One has slept in ease."</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">The Buddha:</p>
							
							<p class="f4 in2">"Always, always,<br />
							he sleeps in ease:<br />
							the brahman totally unbound,<br />
							who doesn’t adhere<br />
							to sensual pleasures,<br />
							who’s without acquisitions<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and cooled.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Having<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cut all ties<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and subdued fear in the heart,<br />
							calmed,<br />
							he sleeps in ease,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;having reached peace<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of awareness."</p>
