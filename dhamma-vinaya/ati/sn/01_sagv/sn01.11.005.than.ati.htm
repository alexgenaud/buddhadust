There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Once in the past the devas and asuras<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> were arrayed for battle. Then <a id="vepacitti">Vepacitti</a> the asura-king said to <a id="sakka">Sakka</a> the deva-king: 'Let there be victory through what is well spoken.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Yes, Vepacitti, let there be victory through what is well spoken.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So the devas and asuras appointed a panel of judges, [thinking,] 'These will decide for us what is well spoken and poorly spoken.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Vepacitti the asura-king said to Sakka the deva-king, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Sakka the deva-king said to Vepacitti the asura-king, 'But you are the senior deity here, Vepacitti. You say a verse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Vepacitti recited this verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Fools would flare up even more<br />
					if there were no constraints.<br />
					Thus an enlightened one<br />
					should restrain the fool<br />
					with a heavy stick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When Vepacitti had said this verse, the asuras applauded but the devas were silent. So Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Sakka recited this verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'This, I think,<br />
					is the only constraint for a fool:<br />
					When, knowing the other's provoked,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you mindfully grow calm.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When Sakka had said this verse, the devas applauded but the asuras were silent. So Sakka said to Vepacitti, 'Say a verse, Vepacitti!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Vepacitti recited this verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'Vasava,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> I see a fault<br />
					in this very forbearance:<br />
					<a id="cow">When</a> the fool thinks,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's forbearing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of fear of me,"<br />
					the idiot pursues you even more — <br />
					as a cow, someone who runs away.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When Vepacitti had said this verse, the asuras applauded but the devas were silent. So Vepacitti said to Sakka, 'Say a verse, deva-king!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, Sakka recited this verse:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">'It doesn't matter<br />
					whether he thinks,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's forbearing<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of fear of me."<br />
					One's own true good<br />
					is the foremost good.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing better<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than patience<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is found.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Whoever, when strong,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is forbearing<br />
					to one who is weak:<br />
					that's the foremost patience.<br />
					The weak must constantly endure.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">They call that strength<br />
					no strength at all:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whoever's strength<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the strength of a fool.<br />
					There's no reproach<br />
					for one who is strong,<br />
					guarding — guarded by — Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">You make things worse<br />
					when you flare up<br />
					at someone who's angry.<br />
					Whoever doesn't flare up<br />
					at someone who's angry<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; wins a battle<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hard to win.</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">You live for the good of both<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — your own, the other's — <br />
					when, knowing the other's provoked,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you mindfully grow calm.<br />
					When you work the cure of both<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — your own, the other's — <br />
					those who think you a fool<br />
					know nothing of Dhamma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When Sakka had said this verse, the devas applauded but the asuras were silent. Then the deva and asura panel of judges said, 'The verses said by Vepacitti the asura-king lie in the sphere of swords and weapons — thence arguments, quarrels, and strife. Whereas the verses said by Sakka the deva-king lies outside the sphere of swords and weapons — thence no arguments, no quarrels, no strife. The victory through what is well spoken goes to Sakka the deva-king.'</p>
					<p class="f4">"And that, monks, is how the victory through what was well spoken went to Sakka the deva-king."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup>The devas and asuras were two groups of deities who fought for control of heaven (like the gods and titans in Greek mythology). The devas eventually won. The asuras, known for their fierce anger, later became classed as angry demons and, in some Buddhist cosmologies, are regarded as a class of being lower than human.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup>Vasava — "Powerful" — is one of Sakka's epithets.</p>
