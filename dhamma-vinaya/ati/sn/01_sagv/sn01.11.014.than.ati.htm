					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Monks, once there was a man living in this very Rājagaha — a poor, pitiful wretch of a person.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">He undertook conviction in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Blessed One, undertook virtue, undertook learning, undertook relinquishment, undertook discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he outshone the other devas in beauty and in rank.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the devas of the Thirty-three were indignant, annoyed, and complained:</p>

					<p class="f4">There he outshines the other devas in beauty and in rank.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then Sakka the deva-king addressed the devas of the Thirty-three, 'Dear sirs, don't be indignant with this young deva.</p>

					<p class="f4">Before, this young deva, when he was a human being, undertook conviction in the Dhamma and Vinaya proclaimed by the Blessed One, undertook virtue, undertook learning, undertook relinquishment, undertook discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he outshines the other devas in beauty and in rank.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, conciliating the devas of the Thirty-three, Sakka the deva-king on that occasion recited these verses:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">'One whose conviction in the Tathāgata<br />

							"Not poor," they say of him.<br />
							Not in vain his life.<br />
							So conviction and virtue,<br />
