Then King Pasenadi Kosala went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "For one who is born, lord, is there anything other than aging and death?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"For one who is born, great king, there is nothing other than aging and death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even for those who are affluent noble warriors—rich, with great wealth and property, with vast amounts of gold and silver, vast amounts of valuables and commodities, vast amounts of wealth and grain: Even for them, when born, there is nothing other than aging and death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even for those who are affluent brahmans—rich, with great wealth and property, with vast amounts of gold and silver, vast amounts of valuables and commodities, vast amounts of wealth and grain: Even for them, when born, there is nothing other than aging and death.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even for those who are Worthy Ones whose effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, laid to waste the fetter of becoming, and who are released through right gnosis: Even for them, this body is subject to breaking up, subject to being cast away."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even royal chariots<br />
					well-embellished<br />
					get run down,<br />
					and so does the body<br />
					succumb to old age.<br />
					But the Dhamma of the good<br />
					doesn't succumb to old age:<br />
					The good let the civilized know."</p>
