					<p class="f4">As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One: "Just now, lord, while I was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in my awareness: 'Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated and heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated and heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, great king! That's the way it is! Few are those people in the world who, when acquiring lavish wealth, don't become intoxicated and heedless, don't become greedy for sensual pleasures, and don't mistreat other beings. Many more are those who, when acquiring lavish wealth, become intoxicated and heedless, become greedy for sensual pleasures, and mistreat other beings."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">Impassioned &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with sensual possessions,<br />
					greedy, dazed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by sensual pleasures,<br />
					they don't awaken to the fact<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that they've gone too far — <br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like deer into trap laid out.<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Afterwards it's bitter for them:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; evil for them<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the result.</p>
