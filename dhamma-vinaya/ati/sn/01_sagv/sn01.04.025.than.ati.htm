					<p class="f4">"Why are you depressed, Daddy?<br />
					For which man do you grieve?<br />
					We—having bound him<br />
					like a wilderness elephant<br />
					with a snare of passion—<br />
					will bring him to you.<br />
					Under your power he'll be."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Māra:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"An arahant, well-gone in the world,<br />
					isn't easily brought in by passion.<br />
					He's gone beyond Māra's sway:<br />
					That's why I'm so violently sad."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said to him, "We serve you at your feet, contemplative."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One paid them no attention, as he was released in the unexcelled ending of acquisitions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went off to one side and considered, "Various are the appetites of men. Why don't we each assume the form of a hundred girls?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—having each assumed the form of a hundred girls, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said to him, "We serve you at your feet, contemplative."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Again, the Blessed One paid them no attention, as he was released in the unexcelled ending of acquisitions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went off to one side and considered, "Many and varied are the appetites of men. Why don't we each assume the form of a hundred women who have never given birth?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—having each assumed the form of a hundred women who had never given birth, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said to him, "We serve you at your feet, contemplative." Again, the Blessed One paid them no attention, as he was released in the unexcelled ending of acquisitions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went off to one side and considered, "Many and varied are the appetites of men. Why don't we each assume the form of a hundred women who have borne one child ... a hundred women who have borne two children ... a hundred middle-aged women ... a hundred older women?" So Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—having each assumed the form of a hundred older women, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, said to him, "We serve you at your feet, contemplative." Again, the Blessed One paid them no attention, as he was released in the unexcelled ending of acquisitions.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went off to one side and said, "Wow, it's true what our father said:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'An arahant, well-gone in the world,<br />
					isn't easily brought in by passion.<br />
					He's gone beyond Māra's sway:<br />
					That's why I'm so violently sad.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Any contemplative or brahman who hadn't gone beyond passion, if we were to approach him with this approach: His heart would split or he would cough up hot blood or he would go mad, out of his mind. Just as a green reed cut down would dry out, wither, and fade, in the same way, he would dry out, wither, and fade."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, stood to one side. As she was standing there, Māra's daughter Craving addressed the Blessed One with verses:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Practicing jhāna in the forest—<br />
					are you overcome with grief?<br />
					Have you lost,<br />
					or do you desire, wealth?<br />
					Have you done something<br />
					blameworthy in the village?<br />
					Is it because<br />
					you become intimate people,<br />
					but intimacy doesn't prosper for you<br />
					with anyone at all?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Buddha:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Having attained the goal—<br />
					peace of the heart—<br />
					having defeated the army<br />
					of forms endearing and alluring,<br />
					practicing jhāna alone,<br />
					I awakened to bliss.<br />
					That's why I don't become intimate<br />
					with people,<br />
					why intimacy doesn't prosper with me<br />
					when made by anyone at all."<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughter Discontent addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"How does a monk here often dwell,<br />
					who has crossed the five floods<br />
					and also the sixth?<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">How, while cultivating jhāna,<br />
					does he keep perceptions of sensuality far away?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Buddha:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Calmed in body,<br />
					well released in mind,<br />
					without fabrications,<br />
					mindful, homeless,<br />
					having known the Dhamma,<br />
					practicing jhāna without directed thought,<br />
					he's not provoked,<br />
					doesn't flow, isn't slothful:<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like this<br />
					a monk here often dwells,<br />
					who has crossed the five floods<br />
					and also the sixth.<br />
					Cultivating jhāna like this,<br />
					he keeps perceptions of sensuality<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;far&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;away."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughter Passion addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Cutting off craving,<br />
					practicing with a group:<br />
					Yes, many and faithful<br />
					they'll fare.<br />
					O, how this homeless one,<br />
					having snatched them<br />
					from the King of Death,<br />
					will lead a great crowd away."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The Buddha:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The Tathāgatas, great heroes,<br />
					do lead<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the true Dhamma.<br />
					For those who know,<br />
					leading by Dhamma,<br />
					what's the jealousy?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra's daughters—Craving, Discontent, and Passion—went to Māra the Evil One. He saw them coming from afar and, on seeing them, addressed them with verses:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Fools!<br />
					Cleave a mountain<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a lily-stalk.<br />
					Dig up a crag<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your fingernails.<br />
					Chew on iron<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with your teeth.<br />
					Raising a rock<br />
					above your head,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;go over a cliff,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into a pit.<br />
					Like striking your chest<br />
					on a stump—<br />
					you weary yourselves with Gotama."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Blazing they came—
					Craving, Discontent, and Passion—
					but the Teacher blew them off,
					like the wind, a fallen tuft of cotton.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This phrase—<em>sakkhī na sampajjati kenaci te/me</em>—appears to admit two meanings. 1) One's attempts at intimacy with others don't succeed. 2) Others' attempts at intimacy with one don't succeed. Māra's daughter—following their father in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/01_sagv/idx_04_marasamyutta.htm#p24">SN 4:24</a>, mean it in the first sense. The Buddha here means it in the second.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The six floods are the defilements associated with each of the six senses.</p>
