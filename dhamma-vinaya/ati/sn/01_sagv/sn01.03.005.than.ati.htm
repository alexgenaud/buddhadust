As he was sitting to one side, King Pasenadi Kosala said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, lord,<br />
					while I was alone in seclusion,<br />
					this train of thought arose in my awareness:<br />
					'Who have themselves protected,<br />
					and who leave themselves unprotected?'<br />
					Then it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Those who engage in bodily misconduct,<br />
					verbal misconduct,<br />
					and mental misconduct<br />
					leave themselves unprotected.<br />
					Even though a squadron of elephant troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					a squadron of cavalry troops,<br />
					a squadron of chariot troops,<br />
					a squadron of infantry troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					still they leave themselves unprotected.<br />
					Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that's an external protection,<br />
					not an internal one.<br />
					Therefore they leave themselves unprotected.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those who engage in good bodily conduct,<br />
					good verbal conduct,<br />
					and good mental conduct<br />
					have themselves protected.<br />
					Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops,<br />
					a squadron of cavalry troops,<br />
					a squadron of chariot troops,<br />
					nor a squadron of infantry troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					still they have themselves protected.<br />
					Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that's an internal protection,<br />
					not an external one.<br />
					Therefore they have themselves protected.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, great king!<br />
					That's the way it is!<br />
					Those who engage in bodily misconduct,<br />
					verbal misconduct,<br />
					and mental misconduct<br />
					leave themselves unprotected.<br />
					Even though a squadron of elephant troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					a squadron of cavalry troops,<br />
					a squadron of chariot troops,<br />
					a squadron of infantry troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					still they leave themselves unprotected.<br />
					Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that's an external protection,<br />
					not an internal one.<br />
					Therefore they leave themselves unprotected.</p>

					<p class="f4">But those who engage in good bodily conduct,<br />
					good verbal conduct,<br />
					and good mental conduct<br />
					have themselves protected.<br />
					Even though neither a squadron of elephant troops,<br />
					a squadron of cavalry troops,<br />
					a squadron of chariot troops,<br />
					nor a squadron of infantry troops<br />
					might protect them,<br />
					still they have themselves protected.<br />
					Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because that's an internal protection,<br />
					not an external one.<br />
					Therefore they have themselves protected."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Having said that,<br />
					the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2">"<a id="restraint">Restraint</a> with the body is good,<br />
					good is restraint with speech.<br />
					Restraint with the heart is good,<br />
					good is restraint &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; everywhere.<br />
					Restrained everywhere,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; conscientious,<br />
					one is said to be<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; protected."</p>
