					<p class="f4">Then, when the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, this train of thought arose in his awareness, "Released am I from that practice of extreme austerities! How good that I'm released from that useless practice of extreme austerities! How good that I'm released, that I have attained awakening!"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Māra the Evil One, having known with his awareness the train of thought in the Blessed One's awareness, went to the Blessed One and addressed him in verse:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Straying from the ascetic actions<br />
					by which young brahmans are purified,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;impure, you suppose you're pure.<br />
					You've missed the path to purity."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, having understood that "This is Mara the Evil One," the Blessed One replied to him in verses:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Having known it to be useless,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any further<span class="f2"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> austerity,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each bringing nothing,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like oars and rudder on dry land:<br />
					Developing virtue, concentration, and discernment,<br />
					the path to awakening,<br />
					I've&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attained the foremost purity.<br />
					But you, End-maker,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are struck down."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Mara the Evil One—sad and dejected at realizing, "The Blessed One knows me, the One Well-Gone knows me"—vanished right there.</p>
