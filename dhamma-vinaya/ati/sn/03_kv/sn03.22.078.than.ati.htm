					<p class="f4">Having left his lair, he stretches himself.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having stretched himself, he looks all around the four directions.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having looked all around the four directions, he roars his lion's roar three times.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having roared his lion's roar three times, he heads out for game.</p>

					<p class="f4">Any animals who hear the sound of the roar of the lion, the king of beasts, for the most part feel fear, terror, and fright.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who live in holes go into their holes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who live in the water go into the water.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who live in the forest go into the forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Birds flee to the air.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even royal bull elephants, bound by strong leather bonds in villages, towns, and capital cities, bursting and breaking their bonds, frightened, scattering their urine and feces, run to and fro.</p>

					<p class="f4">So powerful among animals, monks, is the lion, the king of beasts — so mighty and majestic.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, when a Tathāgata appears in the world — worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed — he teaches the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is perception....</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are fabrications....</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Any devas who are long-lived, beautiful, abounding in pleasure, established for a long time in high palaces, on hearing the Tathāgata's Dhamma, for the most part feel fear, terror, and fright:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Being inconstant, it seems, we supposed we were constant!</p>

					<p class="f4">Being impermanent, we supposed we were permanent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Non-eternal, we supposed we were eternal!</p>

					<p class="f4">We — inconstant, impermanent, and non-eternal, it seems — are encompassed in self-identification.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So powerful in the world with its devas, monks, is the Tathāgata — so mighty and majestic."</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">When the Awakened One, through direct knowledge,<br />
							— the Teacher, the person with no peer<br />
							in the world with its devas —<br />
							sets the Dhamma wheel rolling:<br />
							the cessation of self-identification,<br />
							and the cause of self-identification,<br />
							and the noble eightfold path,<br />
							leading to the stilling of suffering,<br />
							long-lived devas — beautiful, prestigious —<br />
							become fearful and frightened,<br />
							like deer at a lion's roar.<br />
							'We're not beyond self-identification.<br />
							It seems we're inconstant,' [they say,]<br />
							on hearing the word of the Worthy One,<br />
							the one fully released,<br />
							the one who is Such.</p>
