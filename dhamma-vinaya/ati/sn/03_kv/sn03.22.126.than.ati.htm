					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Here and in the following sutta, CDB mistranslates <i>samudaya,</i> origination, as "arising." This gives the impression that ignorance can be ended simply through bare awareness of the aggregates' arising and passing away. <i>Samudaya,</i> however, denotes a condition responsible for making the aggregates arise, something that cannot be known through simply watching them. One has to interact with them in a way that allows one to see which factors co-arising with the aggregates are actually causing them to arise, and which are not. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p5">SN 22:5</a> recommends developing concentration for this purpose. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p36">AN 9:36</a> expands on this recommendation, showing how concentration is actually composed of aggregates. In this way, one learns about the origination of the aggregates by trying to make a state of concentration from them.<br />
					<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p5">SN 22:5</a> also identifies acts of enjoying, welcoming, and remaining fastened as the origination of the aggregates. <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p56">SN 22:56–57</a> identify the origination of nutriment as the origination of form; the origination of contact as the origination of feeling, perception, and fabrications; and the origination of name-and-form as the origination of consciousness. These two analyses can perhaps be combined by noting, in the case of form, that the simple presence of nutriment does not cause form. There has to be the act of welcoming, etc., that causes one to <i>take</i> the nutriment that nurtures form.</p>
