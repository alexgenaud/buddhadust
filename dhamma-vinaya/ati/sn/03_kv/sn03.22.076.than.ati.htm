					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks, form is inconstant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is inconstant is stressful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is stressful is not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling is inconstant...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Perception is inconstant...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fabrications are inconstant...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness is inconstant.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is inconstant is stressful.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is stressful is not-self.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, to whatever extent there are abodes of beings,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> to whatever extent there is the height of becoming, arahants are supreme, arahants are the best in the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">"How happy are the arahants!<br />
							Craving isn't found in them.<br />
							Cut off is the conceit, 'I am';<br />
							burst, the net of delusion.<br />
							Having reached imperturbability,<br />
							their minds are clear and disturbance-free.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Unsullied in the world,<br />
							Brahmā–become, effluent-free,<br />
							comprehending the five aggregates,<br />
							ranging in seven true dhammas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							praiseworthy men of integrity:<br />
							They are the Buddha's children, his sons.</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">Consummate in the seven treasures,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span><br />
							trained in the threefold training<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span><br />
							these great heroes go wandering<br />
							having left fear and terror behind.<br />
							Consummate in ten factors,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span><br />
							great nāgas,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> concentrated,<br />
							they are the best in the world:<br />
							Craving isn't found in them.<br />
							The adept's knowledge<br />
							has arisen in them:<br />
							'This is the last body.'</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">As for the essence of the holy life,<br />
							they don't depend on others in that.<br />
							They don't waver from conceits.<br />
							They're released from further-becoming.<br />
							Having reached the level of the tamed,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span><br />
							they have victory in the world.<br />
							Above, around, and below,<br />
							delight isn't found in them.<br />
							They roar their lion's roar:<br />
							'In the world, the awakened<br />
							are unexcelled!'"</p>
