Venerable Assaji is suffering an illness which prevents him from attaining jhāna and he is worried about falling away.

					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Ven. Assaji was staying at Kassapaka's Park, diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Assaji said to his attendants, "Come, friends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to the Blessed One and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say, 'Lord, the monk Assaji is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would visit the monk Assaji, out of sympathy for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, friend," to Ven. Assaji, the monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there they said, "Lord, the monk Assaji is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to the Blessed One's feet.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he says, 'It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would visit the monk Assaji, out of sympathy for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One acquiesced through silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the evening,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> went to Ven. Assaji.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Assaji saw the Blessed One coming from afar and, on seeing him, stirred from his bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the Blessed One said to him, "Enough, Assaji. Don't stir from your bed.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these seats already arranged.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will sit there."</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One sat down on an arranged seat.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had sat down, he said to Ven. Assaji, "I hope you are getting better, Assaji.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not getting better, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope, Assaji, that you have no anxiety, no remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Actually, lord, I have not just a little anxiety, not just a little remorse."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But I hope, Assaji, that you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, I can't fault myself with regard to my virtue."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if you can't fault yourself with regard to your virtue, then what is your anxiety?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is your remorse?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, before when I was sick I dwelled calming bodily fabrications.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">But now I don't gain that concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">On not gaining that concentration, the thought occurs to me, 'May I not decline!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Assaji, those contemplatives and brāhmans for whom concentration is the essence, for whom concentration is the contemplative life:<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> When they don't gain concentration, the thought occurs to them, 'May we not decline!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Assaji?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it proper to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is consciousness constant or inconstant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it proper to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, Assaji, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If sensing a feeling of pleasure, he discerns it as 'inconstant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not grasped at.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not relished.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling of pain, he discerns it as 'inconstant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not grasped at.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not relished.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, he discerns it as 'inconstant.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not grasped at.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns it as 'not relished.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"If sensing a feeling of pleasure, he senses it disjoined from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling of pain, he senses it disjoined from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain, he senses it disjoined from it.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[He discerns it as 'inconstant.' He discerns it as 'not grasped at.' He discerns it as 'not relished.']</i><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns, 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns, 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as an oil lamp would burn in dependence on oil and wick and, from the termination of the oil and wick, it would go out unnourished; in the same way, if sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns, 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns, 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'"</p>
