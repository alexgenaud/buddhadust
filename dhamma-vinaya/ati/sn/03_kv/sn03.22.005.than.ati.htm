					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Develop concentration, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">As one enjoys, welcomes, and remains fastened to form, there arises delight.</p>
