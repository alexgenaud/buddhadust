					<p class="f4">"Friends, Ven. Punna Mantaniputta was very helpful to us<br />
					when we were newly ordained.<br />
					He exhorted us with this exhortation:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It's with possessiveness, friend Ānanda,<br />
					that there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					And through possessiveness of what<br />
					is there "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of form<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					Through possessiveness of feeling<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					Through possessiveness of perception<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					Through possessiveness of fabrications<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					Through possessiveness of consciousness<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="mirror"></a>"'Just as if a young woman<br />
					— or a man —<br />
					youthful, fond of adornment,<br />
					contemplating the image<br />
					of her face<br />
					in a mirror, pure and bright,<br />
					or in a bowl of clear water,<br />
					would look with possessiveness,<br />
					not without possessiveness.<br />
					In the same way,<br />
					through possessiveness of form<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness,<br />
					Through possessiveness of feeling<br />
					there is "I am,"<br />
					not without possessiveness,<br />

					<p class="f4">"'What do you think, friend Ānanda<br />
					— Is form constant or inconstant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Inconstant, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Stressful, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />

					<p class="f4">"'No, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Thus, friend Ānanda,<br />
					any form whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every form is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any feeling whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every feeling is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />

					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any perception whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every perception is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any fabrications whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every fabrication is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any consciousness whatsoever<br />

					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the noble ones<br />
					grows disenchanted with form,<br />
					disenchanted with feeling,<br />
					disenchanted with perception,<br />
					disenchanted with fabrications,<br />
					disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through disenchantment,<br />
					he becomes dispassionate.<br />
					Through dispassion,<br />
					he is fully released.<br />
					With full release,<br />
					there is the knowledge,<br />
					'Fully released.'<br />
					He discerns that<br />
					'Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.<br />
					There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, Ven. Punna Mantaniputta was very helpful to us<br />
					when we were newly ordained.<br />
					He exhorted us with this exhortation.<br />
					And when I had heard this Dhamma-explanation<br />
					from Ven. Punna Mantaniputta,<br />
					I broke through to the Dhamma."</p>
