There Ven. Ānanda addressed the monks, "Friend monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Ānanda said, "Friends, Ven. Puṇṇa Mantāṇiputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exhorted us with this exhortation:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It's with possessiveness, friend Ānanda, that there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And through possessiveness of what is there "I am," not without possessiveness?</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of form there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">fabrications...</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of consciousness there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Just as if a young woman — or a man — youthful, fond of adornment, contemplating the image of her face in a mirror, pure and bright, or in a bowl of clear water, would look with possessiveness, not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, through possessiveness of form there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">fabrications...</p>

					<p class="f4">Through possessiveness of consciousness there is "I am," not without possessiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'What do you think, friend Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form constant or inconstant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Inconstant, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Stressful, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'... Is feeling constant or inconstant?' —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Inconstant, friend.' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"'... Is perception constant or inconstant?' —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Inconstant, friend.' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"'... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?' —</p>

					<p class="f4">'Inconstant, friend.' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"'What do you think, friend Ānanda?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is consciousness constant or inconstant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Inconstant, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Stressful, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'No, friend.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Thus, friend Ānanda, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: Every form is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any feeling whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any perception whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any fabrications whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: Every consciousness is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment as:</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, "Released."</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that "Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world."'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friends, Ven. Puṇṇa Maṇtāniputta was very helpful to us when we were newly ordained.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exhorted us with this exhortation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when I had heard this Dhamma-explanation from Ven. Puṇṇa Maṇtāniputta, I broke through to the Dhamma."</p>
