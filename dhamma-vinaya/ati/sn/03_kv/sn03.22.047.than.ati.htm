					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said, "Monks, whatever contemplatives or brahmans who assume in various ways when assuming a self, all assume the five clinging-aggregates, or a certain one of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes fabrications to be the self, or the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self as in fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, both this assumption and the understanding, 'I am,' occur to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so it is with reference to the understanding 'I am' that there is the appearance of the five faculties — eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body [the senses of vision, hearing, smell, taste, and touch].</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, there is the intellect, there are ideas [mental qualities], there is the property of ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">To an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person, touched by experience born of the contact of ignorance, there occur (the thoughts):</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am,' 'I am thus,' 'I shall be,' 'I shall not be,' 'I shall be possessed of form,' 'I shall be formless,' 'I shall be percipient [conscious],' 'I shall be non-percipient,' or 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"The five faculties, monks, continue as they were.</p>

					<p class="f4">And with regard to them the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones abandons ignorance and gives rise to clear knowing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to the fading of ignorance and the arising of clear knowing, (the thoughts) — 'I am,' 'I am this,' 'I shall be,' 'I shall not be,' 'I shall be possessed of form,' 'I shall be formless,' 'I shall be percipient,' 'I shall be non-percipient,' and 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' — do not occur to him."</p>
