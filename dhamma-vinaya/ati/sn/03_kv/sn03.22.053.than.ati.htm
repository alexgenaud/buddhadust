					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said, "One attached is unreleased; one unattached is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to (a physical) form, supported by form (as its object), landing on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to feeling, supported by feeling (as its object), landing on feeling, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to perception, supported by perception (as its object), landing on perception, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to fabrications, supported by fabrications (as its object), landing on fabrications, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an arising, a growth, an increase, or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness, then owing to the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no landing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, thus not having landed, not increasing, not concocting, is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its release, it is steady.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its steadiness, it is contented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
