There the Blessed One said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"One attached is unreleased;<br />
					one unattached is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness,<br />
					when taking a stance,<br />
					stand attached to (a physical) form,<br />
					supported by form (as its object),<br />
					established on form,<br />
					watered with delight,<br />
					it would exhibit growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness,<br />
					when taking a stance,<br />
					stand attached to feeling,<br />
					supported by feeling (as its object)<br />
					established on feeling,<br />
					watered with delight,<br />
					it would exhibit growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness,<br />
					when taking a stance,<br />
					stand attached to perception,<br />
					supported by perception (as its object),<br />
					established on perception,<br />
					watered with delight,<br />
					it would exhibit growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness,<br />
					when taking a stance,<br />
					stand attached to fabrications,<br />
					supported by fabrications (as its object),<br />
					established on fabrications,<br />
					watered with delight,<br />
					it would exhibit growth,<br />
					increase,<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were someone to say,<br />
					'I will describe a coming,<br />
					a going,<br />
					a passing away,<br />
					an arising,<br />
					a growth,<br />
					an increase,<br />
					or a proliferation of consciousness<br />
					apart from form,<br />
					from feeling,<br />
					from perception,<br />
					from fabrications,'<br />
					that would be impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness,<br />
					then owing to the abandonment of passion,<br />
					the support is cut off,<br />
					and there is no base for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness,<br />
					thus unestablished,<br />
					not proliferating,<br />
					not performing any function,<br />
					is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its release,<br />
					it is steady.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its steadiness,<br />
					it is contented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its contentment,<br />
					it is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not agitated,<br />
					he (the monk) is totally unbound right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
