					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said, "Monks, suppose there were a river, flowing down from the mountains, going far, its current swift, carrying everything with it, and — holding on to both banks — kāsa grasses, kusa grasses, reeds, vīraṇā grasses, &amp; trees were growing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man swept away by the current would grab hold of the kāsa grasses, but they would tear away, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would grab hold of the kusa grasses... the reeds... the vīraṇā grasses... the trees, but they would tear away, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, there is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">That form tears away from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">That feeling tears away from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">That perception tears away from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes fabrications to be the self, or the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self as in fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those fabrications tear away from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">That consciousness tears away from him, and so from that cause he would come to disaster.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, what do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is perception constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle, common or sublime; far or near: Every form is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any feeling whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">Any perception whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">Any fabrications whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle, common or sublime; far or near: Every consciousness is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
