					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One exclaimed this exclamation:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'It should not be, it should not occur to me [should not be mine]; it will not be, it will not occur to me [will not be mine]':</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk set on this would break the (five) lower fetters."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "In what way would a monk set on this — 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me' — break the (five) lower fetters?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, monk, where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">He assumes fabrications to be the self, or the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self as in fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, inconstant form as 'inconstant form.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, inconstant feeling as 'inconstant feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant perception as 'inconstant perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant consciousness as 'inconstant consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, stressful form as 'stressful form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful perception as 'stressful perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful consciousness as 'stressful consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, not-self form as 'not-self form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self feeling as 'not-self feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self perception as 'not-self perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self fabrications as 'not-self fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self consciousness as 'not-self consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, fabricated form as 'fabricated form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated perception as 'fabricated perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't discern, as it has come to be, that 'form will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'feeling will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'perception will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'fabrications will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'consciousness will not become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma — doesn't assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't assume feeling to be the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">... doesn't assume perception to be the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">... doesn't assume fabrications to be the self.</p>

					<p class="f4">He doesn't assume consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns, as it has come to be, inconstant form as 'inconstant form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant feeling as 'inconstant feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant perception as 'inconstant perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant fabrications as 'inconstant fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... inconstant consciousness as 'inconstant consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns, as it has come to be, stressful form as 'stressful form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful feeling as 'stressful feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful perception as 'stressful perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful fabrications as 'stressful fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... stressful consciousness as 'stressful consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns, as it has come to be, not-self form as 'not-self form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self feeling as 'not-self feeling' ... not-self perception as 'not-self perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self fabrications as 'not-self fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... not-self consciousness as 'not-self consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns, as it has come to be, fabricated form as 'fabricated form'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated feeling as 'fabricated feeling'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated perception as 'fabricated perception'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated fabrications as 'fabricated fabrications'</p>

					<p class="f4">... fabricated consciousness as 'fabricated consciousness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'form will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'feeling will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'perception will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'fabrications will not become'</p>

					<p class="f4">... 'consciousness will not become.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the non-becoming of form, from the non-becoming of feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">of perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">of fabrications...</p>

					<p class="f4">of consciousness, a monk set on this — 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me' — would break the (five) lower fetters."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, a monk set on this would break the (five) lower fetters. But for one knowing in what way, seeing in what way, is there the immediate ending of effluents?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person... falls into fear over what is not grounds for fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is fear for an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person (who thinks), 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But an instructed disciple of the noble ones does not fall into fear over what is not grounds for fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is no fear for an instructed disciple of the noble ones (who thinks), 'It should not be, it should not occur to me; it will not be, it will not occur to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to form, supported by form (as its object), landing on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to feeling, supported by feeling (as its object), landing on feeling, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to perception, supported by perception (as its object), landing on perception, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to fabrications, supported by fabrications (as its object), landing on fabrications, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an arising, a growth, an increase, or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness, then owing to the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no landing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, thus not having landed, not increasing, not concocting, is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to release, it is steady.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to steadiness, it is contented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to contentment, it is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"For one knowing in this way, seeing in this way, monk, there is the immediate ending of effluents."</p>
