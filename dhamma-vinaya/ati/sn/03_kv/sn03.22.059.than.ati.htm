					<p class="f4">There he addressed the group of five monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Form, monks, is not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If form were the self, this form would not lend itself to dis-ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be possible (to say) with regard to form, 'Let my form be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my form not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But precisely because form is not self, this form lends itself to dis-ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is not possible (to say) with regard to form, 'Let my form be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my form not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Feeling is not self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Perception is not self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Fabrications are not self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Consciousness is not self.</p>

					<p class="f4">If consciousness were the self, this consciousness would not lend itself to dis-ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be possible (to say) with regard to consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my consciousness not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But precisely because consciousness is not self, consciousness lends itself to dis-ease.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is not possible (to say) with regard to consciousness, 'Let my consciousness be thus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let my consciousness not be thus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">Every<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> form is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any feeling whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any perception whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any fabrications whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">Every<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> consciousness is to be seen with right discernment as it has come to be:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the group of five monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while this explanation was being given, the minds of the group of five monks, through lack of clinging/sustenance, were released from effluents.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The word "every" here and in all parallel passages is <i>sabba,</i> which is the same as the word for "all." On the range of meaning covered by the word "all," see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_35_salayatanasamyutta.htm#p23">SN 35:23</a>. <a href="../../../../">DN 11</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p15">DN 15</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p49">MN 49</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p81">AN 10:81</a> indicate that there is a type of consciousness that lies outside the range of "all," and so would not fall under the aggregate of consciousness.
