					<p class="f4">Then the householder Nakulapitar [Nakula's father] went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, I am a feeble old man, aged, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am afflicted in body and ailing with every moment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it's only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One and the monks who nourish the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One teach me, may the Blessed One instruct me, for my long-term benefit and happiness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is afflicted, weak, and encumbered.</p>

					<p class="f4">For who, looking after this body, would claim even a moment of true health, except through sheer foolishness?</p>

					<p class="f4">So you should train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even though I may be afflicted in body, my mind will be unafflicted.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you should train yourself."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the householder Nakulapitar, delighting in and approving of the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat and — bowing down to the Blessed One and circumambulating him, keeping him to his right — went to Ven. Sāriputta and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Sāriputta said to him, "Your faculties are clear and calm, householder, your complexion pure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have you had the opportunity of listening to a Dhamma talk in the presence of the Blessed One today?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"How could it be otherwise, venerable sir?</p>

					<p class="f4">I have just now been sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how were you sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now I went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I was sitting there I said to him, 'Lord, I am a feeble old man, aged, advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am afflicted in body and ailing with every moment.</p>

					<p class="f4">And it is only rarely that I get to see the Blessed One and the monks who nourish the heart.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One teach me, may the Blessed One instruct me, for my long-term benefit and happiness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When this was said, the Blessed One said to me, 'So it is, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it is.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body is afflicted, weak, and encumbered.</p>

					<p class="f4">For who, looking after this body, would claim even a moment of true health, except through sheer foolishness?</p>

					<p class="f4">So you should train yourself:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even though I may be afflicted in body, my mind will be unafflicted."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you should train yourself.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how I was sprinkled by the Blessed One with the deathless ambrosia of a Dhamma talk."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But why didn't it occur to you to question the Blessed One further:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In what way is one afflicted in body and afflicted in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">And in what way is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"I would come from a long way away to hear the explication of these words in Ven. Sāriputta's presence.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if Ven. Sāriputta himself would enlighten me as to their meaning."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then in that case, householder, listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, venerable sir," the householder Nakulapitar responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, how is one afflicted in body and afflicted in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where an uninstructed, run-of-the-mill person — who has no regard for noble ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no regard for people of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma — assumes form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is seized with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is seized with these ideas, that form changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in his form, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes feeling to be the self, or the self as possessing feeling, or feeling as in the self, or the self as in feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is seized with the idea that 'I am feeling' or 'Feeling is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is seized with these ideas, that feeling changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the feeling, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes perception to be the self, or the self as possessing perception, or perception as in the self, or the self as in perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is seized with the idea that 'I am perception' or 'Perception is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is seized with these ideas, that perception changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the perception, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes fabrications to be the self, or the self as possessing fabrications, or fabrications as in the self, or the self as in fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is seized with the idea that 'I am fabrications' or 'Fabrications are mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is seized with these ideas, those fabrications change and alter.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the fabrications, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He assumes consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is seized with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is seized with these ideas, that consciousness changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the consciousness, there arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, householder, is how one is afflicted in body and afflicted in mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — who has regard for noble ones, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma; who has regard for people of integrity, is well-versed and disciplined in their Dhamma — doesn't assume form to be the self, or the self as possessing form, or form as in the self, or the self as in form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not seized with the idea that 'I am form' or 'Form is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is not seized with these ideas, that form changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the form, there do not arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't assume feeling to be the self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't assume perception to be the self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't assume fabrications to be the self....</p>

					<p class="f4">"He doesn't assume consciousness to be the self, or the self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in the self, or the self as in consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He is not seized with the idea that 'I am consciousness' or 'Consciousness is mine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is not seized with these ideas, that consciousness changes and alters.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the change and alteration in the consciousness, there do not arise in him sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, householder, is how one is afflicted in body but unafflicted in mind."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what Ven. Sāriputta said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the householder Nakulapitar delighted in Ven. Sāriputta's words.</p>
