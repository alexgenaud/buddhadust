					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, are the five aggregates?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the form aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any feeling whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the perception aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any fabrications whatsoever that are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">Those are called the fabrication aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the consciousness aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are called the five aggregates.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the five clinging-aggregates?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any form whatsoever — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — that is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with effluents:</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the form clinging-aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any feeling whatsoever — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — that is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with effluents:</p>
