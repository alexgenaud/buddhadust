					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you the five aggregates and the five clinging-aggregates. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, are the five aggregates?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever form is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever feeling is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever perception is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever (mental) fabrications are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: those are called the aggregate of fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever consciousness is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: that is called the aggregate of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are called the five aggregates.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the five clinging-aggregates?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever form — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental effluent: that is called form as a clinging-aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever feeling — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental effluent: that is called feeling as a clinging-aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever perception — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental effluent: that is called perception as a clinging-aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever (mental) fabrications — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — are clingable, offer sustenance, and are accompanied with mental effluent: those are called fabrications as a clinging-aggregate.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever consciousness — past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near — is clingable, offers sustenance, and is accompanied with mental effluent: that is called consciousness as a clinging-aggregate.</p>
