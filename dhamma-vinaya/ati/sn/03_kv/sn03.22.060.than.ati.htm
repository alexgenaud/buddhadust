					that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Vesali,<br />
					in the Great Wood, at the Hall of the Gabled Pavilion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Mahali the Licchavi<br />
					went to the Blessed One and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />
					sat to one side.<br />
					As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One,</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="purana">Purana Kassapa</a> says this:<br />
					'There is no cause,<br />
					no requisite condition,<br />
					for the defilement of beings.<br />
					Beings are defiled without cause,<br />

					There is no cause,<br />

					Beings are purified without cause,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Mahali, there is cause,<br />
					there is requisite condition,<br />
					for the defilement of beings.<br />
					Beings are defiled with cause,<br />

					There is cause,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Mahali, if form were exclusively stressful<br />
					— followed by stress,<br />
					infused with stress<br />
					and not infused with pleasure —<br />
					beings would not be infatuated with form.</p>

					<p class="f4">But because form is also pleasurable<br />
					— followed by pleasure,<br />
					infused with pleasure<br />
					and not infused with stress —<br />

					<p class="f4">This is the cause,<br />
