<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.57. The Buddha defines one who has mastered Dhamma: He is skilled in knowledge of shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness; he knows what results in their arising, he knows what brings about their ending; he knows their satisfaction, their pain and the way to escape them; and he investigates things in three ways: by way of their elementary data, by way of their relationship to the senses, and by way of that on which they depend for their arising (the paticca samuppada)." />

					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p><i>The term "seven bases" here can also mean the seven notes of the musical scale; and it is possible that the phrase "three modes of investigation" may also be borrowed from musical theory: It may refer to three ways of testing a musical scale once it has been tuned. Thus in this discourse the Buddha seems to be borrowing terms commonly used to describe a consummate musician and applying them to his description of a consummate meditator.</i></p>

					<p><i>The Commentary singles out this discourse as one that entices a serious meditator to practice.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a monk who is skilled in seven bases and has three modes of investigation is fulfilled and fully accomplished in this Dhamma and Vinaya — the ultimate person.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk skilled in seven bases?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk discerns form, the origination of form, the cessation of form, the path of practice leading to the cessation of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns the allure of form, the drawback of form, and the escape from form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns perception....</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns fabrications....</p>

					<p class="f4">"He discerns consciousness, the origination of consciousness, the cessation of consciousness, the path of practice leading to the cessation of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns the allure of consciousness, the drawback of consciousness, and the escape from consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is form?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four great existents [the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property] and the form derived from them: this is called form.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the origination of nutriment comes the origination of form.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of nutriment comes the cessation of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of form, i.e., right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact that pleasure and happiness arise in dependence on form: That is the allure of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fact that form is inconstant, stressful, subject to change: That is the drawback of form.</p>

					<p class="f4">The subduing of desire-passion for form, the abandoning of desire-passion for form: That is the escape from form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"For any contemplatives or brahmans who by directly knowing form in this way, directly knowing the origination of form in this way, directly knowing the cessation of form in this way, directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of form in this way, directly knowing the allure of form in this way, directly knowing the drawback of form in this way, directly knowing the escape from form in this way, are practicing for disenchantment —  dispassion — cessation with regard to form, they are practicing rightly.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who are practicing rightly are firmly based in this Dhamma and Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4">And any contemplatives or brahmans who by directly knowing form in this way, directly knowing the origination of form in this way, directly knowing the cessation of form in this way, directly knowing the path of practice leading to the cessation of form in this way, directly knowing the allure of form in this way, directly knowing the drawback of form in this way, directly knowing the escape from form in this way, are — from disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, lack of clinging/sustenance with regard to form — released, they are well released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who are well released are fully accomplished.</p>

					<p class="f4">And with those who are fully accomplished, there is no cycle for the sake of describing them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">These six bodies of feeling — feeling born of eye-contact, feeling born of ear-contact, feeling born of nose-contact, feeling born of tongue-contact, feeling born of body-contact, feeling born of intellect-contact: This is called feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the origination of contact comes the origination of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">These six bodies of perception — perception of form, perception of sound, perception of smell, perception of taste, perception of tactile sensation, perception of ideas: This is called perception.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are fabrications?</p>

					<p class="f4">These six bodies of intention — intention with regard to form, intention with regard to sound, intention with regard to smell, intention with regard to taste, intention with regard to tactile sensation, intention with regard to ideas: These are called fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the origination of contact comes the origination of fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">And just this noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of fabrications....</p>
