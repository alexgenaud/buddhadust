The Buddha explains that the bhikkhus have entered 'the lowest profession', that of scrap (or 'chunk', or 'glob' or 'mess') hunters, not from want of a livlihood or fears, but because it is in this way that some way out of all the pain in the world may be found." />

					at <a id="Kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a> in the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, after having dismissed the community of monks<br />
					over a particular incident,<br />
					he early in the morning<br />
					put on his robes and,<br />
					carrying his bowl and outer robe,<br />
					went into Kapilavatthu for alms.</p>

					<p class="f4">After having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu,<br />
					after his meal,<br />
					returning from his almsround,<br />
					he went to the Great Forest<br />
					for the day's abiding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Plunging into the Great Forest,<br />
					he sat down<br />
					at the root of a beluva sapling<br />
					as his day's abiding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, as he was alone in seclusion,<br />
					this line of thought arose in his awareness:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have turned away the community of monks.<br />
					But here there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />
					only recently come<br />
					to this Dhamma and discipline.<br />
					If they do not see me,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="calf">Just as when a young calf</a><br />
					does not see its mother,<br />
					there may be alteration in it,<br />
					there may be change;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />
					only recently come<br />
					to this Dhamma and discipline.<br />
					If they do not see me,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="seedling">Just as</a> when young seedlings<br />
					don't get water,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />
					only recently come<br />
					to this Dhamma and discipline.<br />
					If they do not see me,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to aid the community of monks<br />
					as I did before?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <a id="sahampati">Brahma Sahampati</a><br />
					— having known with his own awareness<br />
					the line of thinking in the Blessed One's awareness —<br />
					just as a strong man<br />
					might extend his flexed arm<br />
					or flex his extended arm,<br />
					disappeared from the Brahma-world<br />
					and reappeared in front of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Arranging his upper robe<br />
					over one shoulder,<br />
					he knelt down<br />
					with his right knee on the ground,<br />
					saluted the Blessed One<br />
					with his hands before his heart,<br />
					and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is, O Blessed One!<br />
					So it is, O One Well-gone!<br />
					The Blessed One has turned away<br />
					the community of monks.<br />
					But here there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />
					only recently come to this Dhamma and discipline.<br />
					If they do not see the Blessed One,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when a young calf<br />
					does not see its mother,<br />
					there may be alteration in it,<br />
					there may be change;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />

					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as when young seedlings<br />
					don't get water,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change;<br />
					in the same way,<br />
					there are monks who are new<br />
					— not long gone forth,<br />

					If they do not see me,<br />
					there may be alteration in them,<br />
					there may be change.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let the Blessed One<br />
					delight in the community of monks!<br />
					Let the Blessed One<br />
					welcome the community of monks!<br />
					Let the Blessed One<br />
					aid the community of monks<br />
					as he did before!"</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One acquiesced with silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Brahma Sahampati,<br />
					sensing the Blessed One's acquiescence,<br />
					bowed down to the Blessed One<br />
					and, after circumambulating him,<br />
					disappeared right there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One,<br />
					emerging from seclusion in the evening,<br />
					went to the Banyan Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival he sat down<br />
					on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">After he had sat down<br />
					he worked a psychic feat<br />
					such that the monks<br />
					 went to him contritely,<br />
					in ones and twos.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, they bowed down to him<br />
					and sat to one side.<br />
					As they were sitting there<br />
					the Blessed One said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this is the lowliest form of livelihood,<br />
					that of an almsgoer.<br />
					A term of abuse in the world is,<br />
					'You go about as an almsgoer<br />
					with a bowl in your hand!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And yet sons of good family<br />
					take up [this livelihood] with compelling reason,<br />
					in dependence on a compelling reason<br />
					— not coerced by kings<br />
					nor coerced by thieves<br />
					nor from debt<br />
					nor from fear<br />
					nor to earn a livelihood,<br />
					but [with the thought]:<br />
					'I am oppressed with birth, aging, and death,<br />
					with sorrows, lamentations pains,<br />
					distresses, and despairs.<br />
					I am oppressed with stress,<br />
					overcome with stress.<br />
					Perhaps an ending<br />
					of this entire mass of suffering and stress<br />
					might be found!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And although this son of a good family<br />
					has gone forth in this way,<br />
					he is covetous,<br />
					with strong passion for sensual desires,<br />
					with a mind of ill will,<br />
					of corrupt resolves,<br />
					his mindfulness muddled,<br />
					unalert, unconcentrated,<br />
					his mind distracted,<br />
					loose in his sense faculties.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="log">Just as</a> a log from a funeral pyre,<br />
					burning at both ends,<br />
					smeared with excrement in the middle,<br />
					fills no use as timber<br />
					either in the village<br />
					or in the wilderness:<br />
					I speak of this person<br />
					with this comparison.</p>

					<p class="f4">He has missed out<br />
					on the enjoyments of the householder,<br />
					and yet does not fulfill the goal<br />
					of the contemplative life.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="unskillful3"></a>"Monks, there are these three types of unskillful thinking:<br />
					thinking of sensuality,<br />
					thinking of ill will,<br />
					thinking of harm.</p>

					<p class="f4">These three types of sensual thinking<br />
					cease without remainder<br />
					in one who dwells<br />
					with his mind well established<br />
					in the four frames of reference<br />
					or who develops the themeless concentration.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is reason enough, monks,<br />
					to develop the themeless concentration.<br />
					The themeless concentration,<br />
					when developed and pursued,<br />
					is of great fruit, great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="views2"></a>"Monks, there are these two views:<br />
					the view of becoming<br />
					and the view of non-becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the instructed disciple of the noble ones considers thus:<br />
					'Is there anything in the world<br />
					to which I could cling<br />
					without being blameworthy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns:<br />
					'There is nothing in the world<br />
					to which I could cling<br />
					without being blameworthy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns:<br />
					'In clinging,<br />
					I would be clinging just to form.<br />
					In clinging,<br />
					I would be clinging just to feeling.<br />
					In clinging,<br />
					I would be clinging just to perception.<br />
					In clinging,<br />
					I would be clinging just to fabrications.<br />
					In clinging,<br />
					I would be clinging just to consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From that clinging of mine<br />
					as a requisite condition<br />
					would come becoming.<br />
					From becoming as a requisite condition,<br />
					birth.<br />
					From birth as a requisite condition,<br />
					then aging, illness, and death,<br />
					sorrow, lamentation pain,<br />
					distress, and despair<br />
					would come into play.<br />
					Thus would be the origination<br />
					of this entire mass of suffering and stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks<br />
					— Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it fitting<br />
					to regard what is inconstant,<br />
					stressful,<br />
					subject to change as:<br />
					'This is mine.<br />
					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks<br />
					— Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks<br />
					— Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, monks<br />
					— Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, monks, any form whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every form is to be seen<br />

					<p class="f4">"Any consciousness whatsoever<br />

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus,<br />

					<p class="f4">Through disenchantment,<br />
