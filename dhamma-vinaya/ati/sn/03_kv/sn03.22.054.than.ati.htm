<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.54. The Buddha explains that shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness are, like the five means for the propagation of plants, the five means for the propagation of consciousness. Shapes, sense-experience, perception, and own-making are like the earth. Delight is like water. By eliminating delight in shapes, sense-experience, perception and own-making, consciousness is not propagated and when not propagated it is set free." />

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five means of propagation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Root-propagation, stem-propagation, joint-propagation, cutting-propagation, and seed-propagation as the fifth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if these five means of propagation are not broken, not rotten, not damaged by wind and sun, mature, and well-buried, but there is no earth and no water, would they exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if these five means of propagation are broken, rotten, damaged by wind and sun, immature, and poorly-buried, but there is earth and water, would they exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if these five means of propagation are not broken, not rotten, not damaged by wind and sun, mature, and well-buried, and there is earth and water, would they exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Like the earth property, monks, is how the four standing-spots for consciousness should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the liquid property is how delight and passion should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the five means of propagation is how consciousness together with its nutriment should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to (a physical) form, supported by form (as its object), landing on form, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to feeling, supported by feeling (as its object), landing on feeling, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to perception, supported by perception (as its object), landing on perception, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Should consciousness, when standing, stand attached to fabrications, supported by fabrications (as its object), landing on fabrications, watered with delight, it would exhibit growth, increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Were someone to say, 'I will describe a coming, a going, a passing away, an arising, a growth, an increase, or a proliferation of consciousness apart from form, from feeling, from perception, from fabrications,' that would be impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications....</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness, then owing to the abandonment of passion, the support is cut off, and there is no landing of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness, thus not having landed, not increasing, not concocting, is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its release, it is steady.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its steadiness, it is contented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its contentment, it is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not agitated, he (the monk) is totally unbound right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
