<meta name="description" content="Bhikkhu Thanissaro's translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.22.54. The Buddha explains that shape, sense-experience, perception, own-making and consciousness are, like the five means for the propagation of plants, the five means for the propagation of consciousness. Shapes, sense-experience, perception, and own-making are like the earth. Delight is like water. By eliminating delight in shapes, sense-experience, perception and own-making, consciousness is not propagated and when not propagated it is set free." />

					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One addressed the monks: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these five means of propagation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Root-propagation,||<br />
					stem-propagation,||<br />
					joint-propagation,||<br />
					cutting-propagation,||<br />
					and seed-propagation||<br />
					as the fifth.</p>

					<p class="f4">And if these five means of propagation||<br />
					are not broken,||<br />
					not rotten,||<br />
					not damaged by wind and sun,||<br />
					mature,||<br />
					and well-buried,||<br />
					but there is no earth and no water,||<br />
					would they exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase,||<br />
					and proliferation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if these five means of propagation||<br />
					are broken,||<br />
					rotten,||<br />
					damaged by wind and sun,||<br />
					immature,||<br />
					and poorly-buried,||<br />
					but there is earth and water,||<br />
					would they exhibit growth,||<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if these five means of propagation||<br />

					not rotten,||<br />
					not damaged by wind and sun,||<br />
					mature,||<br />
					and well-buried,||<br />
					and there is earth and water,||<br />
					would they exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase,||<br />
					and proliferation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Like the earth property, monks,||<br />
					is how the four standing-spots for consciousness||<br />
					should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the liquid property||<br />
					is how delight and passion||<br />
					should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Like the five means of propagation||<br />
					is how consciousness||<br />
					together with its nutriment||<br />
					should be seen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness,||<br />
					when taking a stance,||<br />
					stand attached to (a physical) form,||<br />
					supported by form (as its object),||<br />
					established on form,||<br />
					watered with delight,||<br />
					it would exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase,||<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness,||<br />
					when taking a stance,||<br />
					stand attached to feeling,||<br />
					supported by feeling (as its object),||<br />
					established on feeling,||<br />
					watered with delight,||<br />
					it would exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase,||<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness,||<br />
					when taking a stance,||<br />
					stand attached to perception,||<br />
					supported by perception (as its object),||<br />
					established on perception,||<br />
					watered with delight,||<br />
					it would exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase,||<br />
					and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Should consciousness,||<br />
					when taking a stance,||<br />
					stand attached to fabrications,||<br />
					supported by fabrications (as its object),||<br />
					established on fabrications,||<br />
					watered with delight,||<br />
					it would exhibit growth,||<br />
					increase, and proliferation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Were someone to say,</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will describe a coming,||<br />
					a going,||<br />
					a passing away,||<br />
					an arising,||<br />
					a growth,||<br />
					an increase,||<br />
					or a proliferation of consciousness||<br />
					apart from form,||<br />
					from feeling,||<br />
					from perception,||<br />
					from fabrications,'</p>

					<p class="f4">that would be impossible.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of form...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of fabrications...</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk abandons passion for the property of consciousness,||<br />
					then owing to the abandonment of passion,||<br />
					the support is cut off,||<br />
					and there is no base for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Consciousness,||<br />
					thus unestablished,||<br />
					not proliferating,||<br />
					not performing any function,||<br />
					is released.|| ||</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its release,||<br />
					it is steady.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its steadiness,||<br />
					it is contented.</p>

					<p class="f4">Owing to its contentment,||<br />
					it is not agitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not agitated,||<br />
					he (the monk) is totally unbound right within.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Birth is ended,||<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,||<br />
					the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>
