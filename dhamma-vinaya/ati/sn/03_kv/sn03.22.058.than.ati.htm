					<p><i>Some schools of Buddhism teach that there is a qualitative difference between the liberation of a Buddha and that of an arahant disciple. This sutta, however, shows that the Buddha saw the distinction in different terms.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, and their arbitrator.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One himself would elaborate on the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, monks, listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "The Tathāgata — the worthy one, the rightly self-awakened one — is the one who gives rise to the path (previously) unarisen, who engenders the path (previously) unengendered, who points out the path (previously) not pointed out.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knows the path, is expert in the path, is adept at the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">And his disciples now keep following the path and afterward become endowed with the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the difference, this the distinction, this the distinguishing factor between one rightly self-awakened and a monk discernment-released."</p>
