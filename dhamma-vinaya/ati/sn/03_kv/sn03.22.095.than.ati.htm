					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, suppose that a large glob of foam were floating down this Ganges River, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, and appropriately examine it.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a glob of foam?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk sees, observes, and appropriately examines any form that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in form?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now suppose that in the autumn — when it's raining in fat, heavy drops — a water bubble were to appear and disappear on the water, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, and appropriately examine it.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a water bubble?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk sees, observes, and appropriately examines any feeling that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in feeling?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now suppose that in the last month of the hot season a mirage were shimmering, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, and appropriately examine it.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a mirage?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk sees, observes, and appropriately examines any perception that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in perception?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now suppose that a man desiring heartwood, in quest of heartwood, seeking heartwood, were to go into a forest carrying a sharp ax.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he would see a large banana tree: straight, young, of enormous height.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would cut it at the root and, having cut it at the root, would chop off the top.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having chopped off the top, he would peel away the outer skin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Peeling away the outer skin, he wouldn't even find sapwood, to say nothing of heartwood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a man with good eyesight would see it, observe it, and appropriately examine it.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a banana tree?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk sees, observes, and appropriately examines any fabrications that are past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing them, observing them, and appropriately examining them — they would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in fabrications?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now suppose that a magician or magician's apprentice were to display a magic trick at a major intersection, and a man with good eyesight were to see it, observe it, and appropriately examine it.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in a magic trick?</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, a monk sees, observes, and appropriately examines any consciousness that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near.</p>

					<p class="f4">To him — seeing it, observing it, and appropriately examining it — it would appear empty, void, without substance: for what substance would there be in consciousness?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">Having said that, the One Well-Gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">"Form is like a glob of foam;<br />
							feeling, a bubble;<br />
							perception, a mirage;<br />
							fabrications, a banana tree;<br />
							consciousness, a magic trick —<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this has been taught<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the Kinsman of the Sun.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">However you observe them,<br />
							appropriately examine them,<br />
							they're empty, void<br />
							to whoever sees them<br />
							appropriately.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Beginning with the body<br />
							as taught by the One<br />
							with profound discernment:<br />
							When abandoned by three things<br />
							— life, warmth, and consciousness —<br />
							form is rejected, cast aside.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">When bereft of these<br />
							it lies thrown away,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;senseless,<br />
							a meal for others.<br />
							That's the way it goes:<br />
							It's a magic trick,<br />
							an idiot's babbling.<br />
							It's said to be<br />
							a murderer.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span><br />
							No substance here<br />
							is found.</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">Thus a monk, persistence aroused,<br />
							should view the aggregates<br />
							by day and by night,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mindful,<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert;<br />
							should discard all fetters;<br />
							should make himself<br />
							his own refuge;<br />
							should live as if<br />
							his head were on fire —<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in hopes of the state<br />
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with no falling away."</p>
