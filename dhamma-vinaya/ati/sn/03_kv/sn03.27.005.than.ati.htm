<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya 3.27.5. The Buddha teaches that desire and lust for sense-experience born of eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact is a slime over the heart but where this desire and lust have been put away, the heart becomes maliable and fit for seeing the higher knowledge of the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, any desire and passion with regard to feeling born of contact at the eye is a defilement of the mind. Any desire and passion with regard to feeling born of contact at the ear... feeling born of contact at the nose... feeling born of contact at the tongue... feeling born of contact at the body... feeling born of contact at the intellect is a defilement of the mind. When, with regard to these six bases, the defilements of awareness are abandoned, then the mind is inclined to renunciation. The mind fostered by renunciation feels malleable for the direct knowing of those qualities worth realizing."</p>
