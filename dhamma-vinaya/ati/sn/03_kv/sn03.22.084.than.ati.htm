					<p class="f4">On that occasion Ven. Tissa, the Blessed One's paternal cousin, told a large number of monks, "Friends, it's as if my body is drugged. I've lost my bearings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Things aren't clear to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">I lead the holy life dissatisfied.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have uncertainty about the teachings."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they told him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Ven. Tissa, the Blessed One's paternal cousin, has told a large number of monks, 'Friends, it's as if my body is drugged. I've lost my bearings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Things aren't clear to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">I lead the holy life dissatisfied.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have uncertainty about the teachings.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One told a certain monk, "Come, monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">In my name, call Tissa, saying, 'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monk answered and, having gone to Ven. Tissa, on arrival he said, "The Teacher calls you, my friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, my friend," Ven. Tissa replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Is it true, Tissa, that you have told a large number of monks, 'Friends, it's as if my body is drugged.</p>

					<p class="f4">I've lost my bearings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Things aren't clear to me.</p>

					<p class="f4">My mind keeps being overwhelmed with sloth and torpor.</p>

					<p class="f4">I lead the holy life dissatisfied.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have uncertainty about the teachings'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is not without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for form, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is not without passion for form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is not without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">fabrications, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his fabrications?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is not without passion for fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is not without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for consciousness, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is not without passion for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for form, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is without passion for form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for feeling...</p>

					<p class="f4">perception...</p>

					<p class="f4">fabrications, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his fabrications?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is without passion for fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who is without passion, desire, love, thirst, fever, and craving for consciousness, does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair from change and alteration in his consciousness?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how it is for one who is without passion for consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is feeling constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Is perception constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"... Are fabrications constant or inconstant?" —</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord." ...</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is it fitting to regard what is inconstant, stressful, subject to change as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is what I am'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Tissa, any form whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: Every form is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any feeling whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any perception whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any fabrications whatsoever....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any consciousness whatsoever that is past, future, or present; internal or external; blatant or subtle; common or sublime; far or near: Every consciousness is to be seen as it has come to be with right discernment as:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is not mine.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not my self.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is not what I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with form, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tissa, it's as if there were two men, one not skilled in the path, the other skilled in the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">In that case the man not skilled in the path would ask the man skilled in the path about the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">The second man would say, 'Come, my good man, this is the path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go along it a little further and you will see a fork in the road.</p>

					<p class="f4">Avoiding the left fork, take the right.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go along a little further and you will see an intense forest grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go along a little further and you will see a large marshy swamp.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go along a little further and you will see a deep drop-off.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go along a little further and you will see a delightful stretch of level ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made this comparison, Tissa, to convey a meaning.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meaning is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">The man unskilled in the path stands for a run-of-the-mill person.</p>

					<p class="f4">The man skilled in the path stands for the Tathāgata, worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fork in the road stands for uncertainty.</p>

					<p class="f4">The left fork stands for the eightfold wrong path — i.e., wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right fork stands for the noble eightfold path — i.e., right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intense forest grove stands for ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The large marshy swamp stands for sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">The deep drop-off stands for anger and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">The delightful stretch of level ground stands for unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rejoice, Tissa! Rejoice!</p>

					<p class="f4">I am here to exhort you, I am here to aid you, I am here to instruct you!"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, Ven. Tissa delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
