					<p class="f4">On that occasion Ven. Tissa,<br />
					the Blessed One's paternal cousin,<br />
					told a large number of monks,<br />
					"Friends, it's as if my body is drugged.<br />
					I've lost my bearings.<br />
					Things aren't clear to me.<br />
					My mind keeps being overwhelmed<br />
					with sloth and torpor.<br />
					I lead the holy life dissatisfied.<br />
					I have uncertainty about the teachings."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks<br />
					went to the Blessed One<br />
					and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />
					sat to one side.<br />
					As they were sitting there,<br />
					they told him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Ven. Tissa,<br />
					the Blessed One's paternal cousin,<br />
					has told a large number of monks,<br />
					'Friends, it's as if my body is drugged.<br />
					I've lost my bearings.<br />
					Things aren't clear to me.<br />
					My mind keeps being overwhelmed<br />
					with sloth and torpor.<br />
					I lead the holy life dissatisfied.<br />
					I have uncertainty about the teachings.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One told a certain monk,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Come, monk.<br />
					In my name, call Tissa, saying,<br />
					'The Teacher calls you, my friend.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord,"<br />
					the monk answered<br />
					and, having gone to Ven. Tissa,<br />
					on arrival he said,<br />
					"The Teacher calls you, my friend."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, my friend,"<br />
					Ven. Tissa replied.<br />
					Then he went to the Blessed One<br />
					and, on arrival,<br />
					having bowed down to him,<br />
					sat to one side.<br />
					As he was sitting there,<br />
					the Blessed One said to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is it true, Tissa,<br />
					that you have told a large number of monks,<br />
					'Friends, it's as if my body is drugged.<br />
					I've lost my bearings.<br />
					Things aren't clear to me.<br />
					My mind keeps being overwhelmed<br />
					with sloth and torpor.<br />
					I lead the holy life dissatisfied.<br />
					I have uncertainty about the teachings'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa:<br />
					In one who is not without passion,<br />
					desire, love, thirst,<br />
					fever, and craving for form,<br />
					does there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain,<br />
					distress, and despair<br />
					from change and alteration in his form?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />
					That's how it is for one<br />
					who is not without passion for form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa:<br />
					In one who is not without passion,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />
					That's how it is for one<br />

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa:<br />
					In one who is not without passion,<br />

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think, Tissa:<br />
					In one who is without passion,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />
					That's how it is for one<br />

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think, Tissa:<br />
					In one who is without passion,<br />

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Tissa, good.<br />
					That's how it is for one<br />

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa<br />
					— Is form constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />
					what is inconstant,<br />
					stressful,<br />
					subject to change as:<br />
					"This is mine.<br />
					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa<br />
					— Is feeling constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />
					what is inconstant,<br />

					subject to change as:<br />
					"This is mine.<br />
					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa<br />
					— Is perception constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />

					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa<br />
					— Are fabrications constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />
					what is inconstant,<br />
					stressful,<br />
					subject to change as:<br />
					"This is mine.<br />
					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, Tissa<br />
					— Is consciousness constant or inconstant?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Inconstant, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And is that which is inconstant<br />
					easeful or stressful?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Stressful, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'And is it fitting to regard<br />

					"This is mine.<br />
					This is my self.<br />
					This is what I am"?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus, Tissa, any form whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every form is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any feeling whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every feeling is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any perception whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every perception is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any fabrications whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every fabrication is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Any consciousness whatsoever<br />
					that is past, future, or present;<br />
					internal or external;<br />
					blatant or subtle;<br />
					common or sublime;<br />
					far or near:<br />
					every consciousness is to be seen<br />
					as it has come to be<br />
					with right discernment as:<br />
					"This is not mine.<br />
					This is not my self.<br />
					This is not what I am."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus,<br />
					the instructed disciple of the noble ones<br />
					grows disenchanted with form,<br />
					disenchanted with feeling,<br />
					disenchanted with perception,<br />
					disenchanted with fabrications,<br />
					disenchanted with consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through disenchantment,<br />
					he becomes dispassionate.<br />
					Through dispassion,<br />
					he is fully released.<br />
					With full release,<br />
					there is the knowledge,<br />
					'Fully released.'<br />
					He discerns that<br />
					'Birth is ended,<br />
					the holy life fulfilled,<br />
					the task done.<br />
					There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="teaching"></a>"Tissa, it's as if there were two men,<br />
					one not skilled in the path,<br />
					the other skilled in the path.<br />
					In that case<br />
					the man not skilled in the path<br />
					would ask the man skilled in the path<br />
					about the path.<br />
					The second man would say,<br />
					'Come, my good man,<br />
					this is the path.<br />
					Go along it a little further<br />
					and you will see a fork in the road.<br />
					Avoiding the left fork,<br />
					take the right.<br />
					Go along a little further<br />
					and you will see an intense forest grove.<br />
					Go along a little further<br />
					and you will see a large marshy swamp.<br />
					Go along a little further<br />
					and you will see a deep drop-off.<br />
					Go along a little further<br />
					and you will see a delightful stretch of level ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have made this comparison, Tissa,<br />
					to convey a meaning.<br />
					The meaning is this:</p>

					<p class="f4">The man unskilled in the path<br />
					stands for a run-of-the-mill person.</p>

					<p class="f4">The man skilled in the path<br />
					stands for the Tathāgata,<br />
					worthy and rightly self-awakened.</p>

					<p class="f4">The fork in the road<br />
					stands for uncertainty.</p>

					<p class="f4">The left fork<br />
					stands for the eightfold wrong path<br />
					— i.e., wrong view,<br />
					wrong resolve,<br />
					wrong speech,<br />
					wrong action,<br />
					wrong livelihood,<br />
					wrong effort,<br />
					wrong mindfulness,<br />
					wrong concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The right fork<br />
					stands for the noble eightfold path<br />
					— i.e., right view,<br />
					right resolve,<br />
					right speech,<br />
					right action,<br />
					right livelihood,<br />
					right effort,<br />
					right mindfulness,<br />
					right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intense forest grove<br />
					stands for ignorance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The large marshy swamp<br />
					stands for sensual desires.</p>

					<p class="f4">The deep drop-off<br />
					stands for anger and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">The delightful stretch of level ground<br />
					stands for Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rejoice, Tissa! Rejoice!<br />
					I am here to exhort you,<br />
					I am here to aid you,<br />
					I am here to instruct you!"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.<br />
					Gratified, Ven. Tissa delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
