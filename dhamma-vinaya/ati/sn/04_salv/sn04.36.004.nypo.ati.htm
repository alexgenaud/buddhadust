					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Comy. (paraphrased): According to popular belief, there is in the ocean a very deep abyss hollowed out by the force of the water, which is the abode of aquatic animals as well as dragon deities (naga), etc. Hence, for these beings, this abyss provides a basis for their existence, a comfortable abode. Therefore, to call it a <i>bottomless</i> pit is unrealistic and not factual, because it gives an inadequate and non-evident meaning to the word. It is rather bodily pain, inseparable from bodily existence, which deserves to be called a "bottomless pit" of suffering, being a part of unfathomable Samsara.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Comy.: In this Discourse, by the words "noble disciple," it is, in the first place, a Stream-winner <i>(sotapanna)</i> that is meant. But also a meditator with strong insight and keen intellect is capable of withstanding feelings that arise without being carried away by them. He, too, ought to be included here (because he penetrates the feelings to some extent; Sub-comy.).</p>
