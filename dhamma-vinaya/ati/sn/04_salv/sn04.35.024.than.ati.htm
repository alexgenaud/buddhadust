					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "And which All is a phenomenon for abandoning?  to be abandoned? The eye is to be abandoned.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> Forms are to be abandoned. Consciousness at the eye is to be abandoned. Contact at the eye is to be abandoned. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the eye — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is to be abandoned.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear is to be abandoned. Sounds are to be abandoned...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The nose is to be abandoned. Aromas are to be abandoned...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The tongue is to be abandoned. Flavors are to be abandoned...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The body is to be abandoned. Tactile sensations are to be abandoned...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The intellect is to be abandoned. Ideas are to be abandoned. Consciousness at the intellect is to be abandoned. Contact at the intellect is to be abandoned. And whatever there is that arises in dependence on contact at the intellect — experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain — that too is to be abandoned.</p>
