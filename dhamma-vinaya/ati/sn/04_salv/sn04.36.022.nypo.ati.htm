					<p class="f4">"In one way, O monks, I have spoken of two kinds of feelings, and in other ways of three, five, six, eighteen, thirty six and one hundred and eight feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p2">two feelings</a>? Bodily and mental feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p3">three feelings</a>? Pleasant, painful and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p5">five feelings</a>? The faculties of pleasure, pain, gladness, sadness and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p6">six feelings</a>? The feelings born of sense-impression through eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p18">eighteen feelings</a>? There are the (above) six feelings by which there is an approach (to the objects) in gladness; and there are six approaches in sadness and there are six approaches in equanimity.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p36">thirty six feelings</a>? There are six feelings of gladness based on the household life and six based on renunciation; six feelings of sadness based on the household life and six based on renunciation; six feelings of equanimity based on the household life and six based on renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">"What are the <a id="p108">hundred and eight feelings</a>? There are the (above) thirty six feelings of the past; there are thirty six of the future and there are thirty six of the present.</p>
					<p class="f4">"These, O monks, are called the hundred and eight feelings; and this is the way of the Dhamma presentation by which there are one hundred and eight feelings."</p>
