					<p class="f4">Its sharp-bladed grasses would pierce his feet; its thorns would scratch his festering sores.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so, from that cause, he would experience an even greater measure of pain and unhappiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, there is the case where a certain monk, having gone to a village or to the wilderness, meets up with someone who upbraids him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This venerable one, acting in this way, undertaking practices in this way, is a thorn of impurity in this village.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowing this person to be a thorn, one should understand restraint and lack of restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is lack of restraint?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is set on pleasing forms, is repelled by unpleasing forms, and remains with body-mindfulness unestablished, with limited awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where any evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hearing a sound with the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Smelling an aroma with the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tasting a flavor with the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Touching a tactile sensation with the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cognizing an idea with the intellect, he is set on pleasing ideas, is repelled by unpleasing ideas, and remains with body-mindfulness unestablished, with limited awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He does not discern, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where any evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as if a person, catching six animals of different ranges, of different habitats, were to bind them with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Catching a snake, he would bind it with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Catching a crocodile... a bird... a dog... a hyena... a monkey, he would bind it with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Binding them all with a strong rope, and tying a knot in the middle, he would set chase to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then those six animals, of different ranges, of different habitats, would each pull toward its own range and habitat.</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the anthill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The crocodile would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the water.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The bird would pull, thinking, 'I'll fly up into the air.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The dog would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the village.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The hyena would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the charnel ground.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The monkey would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when these six animals became internally exhausted, they would submit, they would surrender, they would come under the sway of whichever among them was the strongest.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, in any monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is undeveloped and unpursued, the eye pulls toward pleasing forms, while unpleasing forms are repellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear pulls toward pleasing sounds...</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose pulls toward pleasing aromas...</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue pulls toward pleasing flavors...</p>

					<p class="f4">The body pulls toward pleasing tactile sensations...</p>

					<p class="f4">The intellect pulls toward pleasing ideas, while unpleasing ideas are repellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is lack of restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is restraint?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, seeing a form with the eye, is not set on pleasing forms, is not repelled by unpleasing forms, and remains with body-mindfulness established, with immeasurable awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where all evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Hearing a sound with the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Smelling an aroma with the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Tasting a flavor with the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Touching a tactile sensation with the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cognizing an idea with the intellect, he is not set on pleasing ideas, is not repelled by unpleasing ideas, and remains with body-mindfulness established, with immeasurable awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, as it has come to be, the awareness-release, the discernment-release, where all evil, unskillful mental qualities that have arisen utterly cease without remainder.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as if a person, catching six animals of different ranges, of different habitats, were to bind them with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Catching a snake, he would bind it with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Catching a crocodile... a bird... a dog... a hyena... a monkey, he would bind it with a strong rope.</p>

					<p class="f4">Binding them all with a strong rope, he would tether them to a strong post or stake.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then those six animals, of different ranges, of different habitats, would each pull toward its own range and habitat.</p>

					<p class="f4">The snake would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the anthill.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The crocodile would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the water.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The bird would pull, thinking, 'I'll fly up into the air.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The dog would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the village.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The hyena would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the charnel ground.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The monkey would pull, thinking, 'I'll go into the forest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when these six animals became internally exhausted, they would stand, sit, or lie down right there next to the post or stake.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, in any monk whose mindfulness immersed in the body is developed and pursued, the eye does not pull toward pleasing forms, and unpleasing forms are not repellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">The ear does not pull toward pleasing sounds...</p>

					<p class="f4">The nose does not pull toward pleasing aromas...</p>

					<p class="f4">The tongue does not pull toward pleasing flavors...</p>

					<p class="f4">The body does not pull toward pleasing tactile sensations...</p>

					<p class="f4">The intellect does not pull toward pleasing ideas, and unpleasing ideas are not repellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is restraint.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The 'strong post or stake' is a synonym for mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Thus you should train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will develop mindfulness immersed in the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will pursue it, give it a means of transport, give it a grounding.</p>

					<p class="f4">We will steady it, consolidate it, and set about it properly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how you should train yourselves."</p>
