As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "What, lord, is feeling? What is the origination of feeling? What is the path of practice leading to the origination of feeling? What is the cessation of feeling? What is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling? What is the allure of feeling, what is its drawback, what is the escape from it?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monk, there are three feelings: a feeling of pleasure, a feeling of pain, a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain. These are called feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Contact is the origination of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Craving is the path of practice leading to feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the cessation of contact is the cessation of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This very noble eightfold path is the path of practice leading to the cessation of feeling. In other words, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whatever pleasure and happiness arise in dependence on feeling: That is the allure of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The fact that feeling is inconstant, stressful, subject to change: That is the drawback of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The subduing of desire-passion for feeling, the abandoning of desire-passion for feeling: That is the escape from feeling."</p>
