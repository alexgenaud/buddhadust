<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 10. The Wanderer of the Vaccha Clan asks Gotama about whether or not there is a self and receives no reply. When asked by Ānanda for the reason he did not reply he explains that answering in the affirmative he would be stating the eternalists view, answering in the negative he would be stating the annihilationists view, answering in the affirmative he would be answering contrary to his knowledge of all things as changing, answering in the negative poor bewildered Vacchagotta would have been even more bewilded than before." />

After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "Now then, Venerable Gotama, is there a self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then is there no self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time, the Blessed One was silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left, <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a> said to the Blessed One, "Why, lord, did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self -- were to answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism [the view that there is an eternal, unchanging soul]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, that would be conforming with those priests and contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If I -- being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self -- were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'"</p>
