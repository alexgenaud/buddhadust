					<p class="f4">Listen and pay careful attention, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one dwell in heedlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye, the mind is stained with forms cognizable via the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is stained, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When pained, the mind does not become centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered, phenomena don’t become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren’t manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk dwells without restraint over the ear... nose... tongue... body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the intellect, the mind is stained with ideas cognizable via the intellect.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is stained, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When pained, the mind does not become centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered, phenomena don’t become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren’t manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how one dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one dwell in heedfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk dwells with restraint over the faculty of the eye, the mind is not stained with forms cognizable via the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is not stained, joy is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who has joy, rapture is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body of one enraptured at heart grows calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the body is calm, one feels pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling pleasure, the mind becomes centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is centered, phenomena become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena are manifest, he is reckoned as one who dwells in heedfulness.</p>
