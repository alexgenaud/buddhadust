					<p class="f4">Listen and pay careful attention, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one dwell in heedlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the eye,<br />
					the mind is stained with forms cognizable via the eye.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is stained,<br />
					there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy,<br />
					there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture,<br />
					there is no serenity.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no serenity,<br />
					he dwells in suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">The mind of one who suffers<br />
					does not become centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered,<br />
					phenomena (dhammas) don't become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren't manifest,<br />
					one is classed simply as<br />
					one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk dwells without restraint over the ear... nose... tongue... body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk dwells without restraint over the faculty of the intellect, the mind is stained with ideas cognizable via the intellect. When the mind is stained, there is no joy. There being no joy, there is no rapture. There being no rapture, there is no serenity. There being no serenity, he dwells in suffering. The mind of one who suffers does not become centered. When the mind is uncentered, phenomena (dhammas) don't become manifest. When phenomena aren't manifest, one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how one dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does one dwell in heedfulness? When a monk dwells with restraint over the faculty of the eye, the mind is not stained with forms cognizable via the eye. When the mind is not stained, there is joy. There being joy, there is rapture. There being rapture, there is serenity. There being serenity, he dwells in ease. The mind of one at ease becomes centered. When the mind is centered, phenomena (dhammas) become manifest. When phenomena are manifest, one is classed simply as one who dwells in heedfulness.</p>
