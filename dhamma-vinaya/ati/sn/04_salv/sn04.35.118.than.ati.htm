Sakka, king of the devas, asks the Buddha why it is that some people attain Nibbāna in this life while others do not. He is told that it is dependent on whether or not a person does those things which support sense-consciousness." />

					<p class="f4">As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed One, "What is the cause, lord, what is the reason why some beings don't totally unbind in the here and now?</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the cause, what is the reason why some beings do totally unbind in the here and now?"</p>
