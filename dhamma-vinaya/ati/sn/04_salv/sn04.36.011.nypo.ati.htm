					<p class="f4">Seated thus, he spoke to the Blessed One as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">"When I went into seclusion, while I was in solitude, this thought occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Three feelings have been taught by the Blessed One: pleasant, painful and neutral feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One has also said that whatever is felt is within suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, with reference to what was it stated by the Blessed One that whatever is felt is within suffering?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well spoken, monk, well spoken!</p>

					<p class="f4">While three feelings have been taught by me, the pleasant, the painful and the neutral, yet I have also said that whatever is felt is within suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, however, was stated by me with reference to the impermanence of (all) conditioned phenomena <i>(sankhara).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">I have said it because conditioned phenomena are liable to destruction, to evanescence, to fading away, to cessation and to change.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is with reference to this that I have stated:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatever is felt is within suffering.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have further taught, monk, the gradual cessation of conditioned phenomena.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who has attained the first meditative absorption <i>(jhāna),</i> speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the second absorption, thought-conception and discursive thinking has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the third absorption, joy has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the fourth absorption, inhalation and exhalation have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the sphere of the infinity of space, perception of form (matter) has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the sphere of the infinity of consciousness, the perception of the sphere of the infinity of space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the sphere of no-thingness, the perception of the sphere of infinity of consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, the perception of the sphere of no-thingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a taint-free monk greed has ceased, hatred has ceased, delusion has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I have further taught, monk the gradual stilling of conditioned phenomena <i>(sankhara).</i></p>

					<p class="f4">In him who has attained the first meditative absorption, speech has been stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the second absorption, thought-conception and discursive thinking have been stilled...</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[To be continued as above, up to:]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a taint-free monk greed has been stilled, hatred has been stilled, delusion has been stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are, monk, these six quietenings.</p>

					<p class="f4">In him who has attained the first absorption, speech is quietened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the second absorption, thought-conception and discursive thinking are quietened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the third absorption, rapture is quietened.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the fourth absorption, inhalation and exhalation is quietened.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Having attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling are quietened.</p>

					<p class="f4">In a taint-free monk greed is quietened, hatred is quietened, delusion is quietened."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> In the section on "being quietened" <i>(patipassaddha),</i> the four immaterial absorptions <i>(arupajjhāna)</i> are not mentioned. According to Comy. they are implied in the "cessation of perception and feelings" (for the attainment of which they are a condition).</p>
