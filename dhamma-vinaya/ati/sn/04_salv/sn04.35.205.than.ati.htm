					<p class="f4">"Suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedless.</p>

					<p class="f4">A corn-eating ox, invading the corn to eat it, would intoxicate itself as much as it liked.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person, not exercising restraint with regard to the six media of sensory contact, intoxicates himself with the five strings of sensuality as much as he likes.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now suppose that corn had ripened and the watchman was heedful.</p>

					<p class="f4">The corn-eating ox would invade the corn to eat it, but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle, he would pin it down by the forehead.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having pinned it down by the forehead, he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having given it a sound thrashing with a stick, he would let it go.</p>

					<p class="f4">"A second time...</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time, the corn-eating ox would invade the corn to eat it, but then the watchman would grab it firmly by the muzzle.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having grabbed it firmly by the muzzle, he would pin it down by the forehead.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having pinned it down by the forehead, he would give it a sound thrashing with a stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having given it a sound thrashing with a stick, he would let it go.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As a result, the corn-eating ox — regardless of whether it went to the village or to the wilds, was standing still or lying down — wouldn't invade the corn again, because it would recall the earlier taste it got of the stick.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, when a monk's mind is held back, thoroughly held back, from the six media of sensory contact, his mind settles inwardly, grows steady, unified, and concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose there were a king or king's minister who had never heard the sound of a lute before.</p>

					<p class="f4">He might hear the sound of a lute and say, 'What, my good men, is that sound — so delightful, so tantalizing, so intoxicating, so ravishing, so enthralling?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They would say, 'That, sire, is called a lute, whose sound is so delightful, so tantalizing, so intoxicating, so ravishing, so enthralling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would say, 'Go and fetch me that lute.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They would fetch the lute and say, 'Here, sire, is the lute whose sound is so delightful, so tantalizing, so intoxicating, so ravishing, so enthralling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He would say, 'Enough of your lute.</p>

					<p class="f4">Fetch me just the sound.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they would say, 'This lute, sire, is made of numerous components, a great many components.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's through the activity of numerous components that it sounds: that is, in dependence on the body, the skin, the neck, the frame, the strings, the bridge, and the appropriate human effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus it is that this lute — made of numerous components, a great many components — sounds through the activity of numerous components.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the king would split the lute into ten pieces, a hundred pieces.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having split the lute into ten pieces, a hundred pieces, he would shave it to splinters.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having shaved it to splinters, he would burn it in a fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having burned it in a fire, he would reduce it to ashes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having reduced it to ashes, he would winnow it before a high wind or let it be washed away by a swift-flowing stream.</p>

					<p class="f4">He would then say, 'A sorry thing, this lute — whatever a lute may be — by which people have been so thoroughly tricked and deceived.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, a monk investigates form, however far form may go.</p>

					<p class="f4">He investigates feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, however far consciousness may go.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he is investigating form... feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness, however far consciousness may go, any thoughts of 'me' or 'mine' or 'I am' do not occur to him."</p>
