<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya 4: Salayatana Vagga; Book 44, Sutta 6. The Venerable Sāriputta explains to the Venerable Kotthika other reasons that the Buddhas has not made asertions sense of compunctioning the existence of one who has attained the goal is that these questions do not arise for one who has abandoned delight in body, sense-experience, own-making and consciousness; or for one who has abandoned delight in becoming; or for one who has abandoned delight in thirst. He then aserts that there is no reason more encompassing for not making such asertions than that such do not occur for one who has abandoned thirst." />

Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita were staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita and exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita, "Now then, friend Koṭṭhita, does the Tathāgata exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, friend, has not been declared by the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata exists after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, friend Koṭṭhita, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Friend, that too has not been declared by the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That has not been declared by the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That too has not been declared by the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, friend Koṭṭhita, when asked if the Tathāgata exists after death, you say, 'That has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathāgata exists after death."'</p>

					<p class="f4">When asked if the Tathāgata does not exist after death... both exists and does not exist after death... neither exists nor does not exist after death, you say, 'That too has not been declared by the Blessed One: "The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, what is the cause, what is the reason, why that has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For one who loves form, who is fond of form, who cherishes form, who does not know or see, as it has come to be, the cessation of form, there occurs the thought, 'The Tathāgata exists after death' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"But for one who doesn't love form, who isn't fond of form, who doesn't cherish form, who knows and sees, as it has come to be, the cessation of form, the thought, 'The Tathāgata exists after death' or 'The Tathāgata does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death' or 'The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death' doesn't occur.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has been freed from the classification of craving, there exists no cycle for describing him."</p>
