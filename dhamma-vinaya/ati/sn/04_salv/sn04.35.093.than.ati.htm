The Buddha explains that it is a consequence of the meeting of a sense organ and a sense object that sense-consciousness, sense-contact, sense-experience, feeling, and self-awareness appear and that each of these individual elements being changeable, the resulting consciousness is changeable." />

And how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pair? In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness. The eye is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Forms are inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Thus this pair is both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Eye-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Whatever is the cause, the requisite condition, for the arising of eye-consciousness, that is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor, how could eye-consciousness be constant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"The coming together, the meeting, the convergence of these three phenomena is eye-contact. Whatever is the cause, the requisite condition, for the arising of eye-contact, that is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor, how could eye-contact be constant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Contacted, one feels. Contacted, one intends. Contacted, one perceives. These phenomena are both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. This is how it's in dependence on a pair that eye-consciousness comes into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness...</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the nose and aromas there arises nose-consciousness...</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the tongue and flavors there arises tongue-consciousness...</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the body and tactile sensations there arises body-consciousness...</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the intellect and ideas there arises intellect-consciousness. The intellect is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Ideas are inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise. Thus this pair is both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Intellect-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.
