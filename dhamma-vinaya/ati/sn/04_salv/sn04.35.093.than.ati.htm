The Buddha explains that it is a consequence of the meeting of a sense organ and a sense object that sense-consciousness, sense-contact, sense-experience, feeling, and self-awareness appear and that each of these individual elements being changeable, the resulting consciousness is changeable." />

					<p class="f4">And how does consciousness come into play in dependence on a pair?</p>

					<p class="f4">In dependence on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms are inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this pair is both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Eye-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the cause, the requisite condition, for the arising of eye-consciousness, that is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor, how could eye-consciousness be constant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"The coming together, the meeting, the convergence of these three phenomena is eye-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the cause, the requisite condition, for the arising of eye-contact, that is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having arisen in dependence on an inconstant factor, how could eye-contact be constant?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Contacted, one feels.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contacted, one intends.</p>

					<p class="f4">Contacted, one perceives.</p>

					<p class="f4">These phenomena are both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how it's in dependence on a pair that eye-consciousness comes into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness....</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the nose and aromas there arises nose-consciousness....</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the tongue and flavors there arises tongue-consciousness....</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the body and tactile sensations there arises body-consciousness....</p>

					<p class="f4">"In dependence on the intellect and ideas there arises intellect-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The intellect is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ideas are inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus this pair is both wavering and fluctuating — inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Intellect-consciousness is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the cause, the requisite condition, for the arising of intellect-consciousness, that is inconstant, changeable, of a nature to become otherwise.</p>
