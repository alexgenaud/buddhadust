					<p class="f4">Then a large number of garden deities, forest deities, tree deities, and deities inhabiting herbs, grasses, and forest giants assembled and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Make a wish, householder:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the future, may I become a king, a wheel-turning monarch!'"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Citta the householder said to the garden deities, forest deities, tree deities, and deities inhabiting herbs, grasses, and forest giants:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even that is inconstant; even that is impermanent; one must abandon even that when one passes on."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Citta the householder's friends and companions, relatives and kinsmen, said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Steady your mindfulness, master.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't ramble."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What did I say that you say to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Steady your mindfulness, master. Don't ramble'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"You said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even that is inconstant; even that is impermanent; one must abandon even that when one passes on.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"That was because garden deities, forest deities, tree deities, and deities inhabiting herbs, grasses, and forest giants have assembled and said to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Make a wish, householder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the future, may I become a king, a wheel-turning monarch!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even that is inconstant; even that is impermanent; one must abandon even that when one passes on.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But what compelling reason do those garden deities, forest deities, tree deities, and deities inhabiting herbs, grasses, and forest giants see, master, that they say to you, 'Make a wish, householder: "In the future, may I become a king, a wheel-turning monarch!"'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It occurs to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Citta the householder is virtuous, of admirable character. If he should wish:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the future, may I become a king, a wheel-turning monarch!" — then, as he is virtuous, this wish of his would succeed because of the purity of his virtue.</p>

					<p class="f4">A righteous one, he will wield righteous power.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Seeing this compelling reason, they assembled and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Make a wish, householder:</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the future, may I become a king, a wheel-turning monarch!"'</p>

					<p class="f4">And I said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even that is inconstant; even that is impermanent; one must abandon even that when one passes on.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then, master, instruct us, too."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then you should train yourselves:</p>

					<p class="f4">'We will be endowed with verified confidence in the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, the Blessed One [the Buddha] is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'We will be endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'We will be possessed of verified confidence in the Saṇgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...who have practiced straight-forwardly...who have practiced methodically...who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types (of noble disciples) when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples: deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'Whatever there may be in our family that can be given away, all that will be shared unstintingly with virtuous ones who are of admirable character.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how you should train yourselves."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, having enjoined his friends and colleagues, his relatives and kinsmen, to place confidence in the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṇgha; having exhorted them to undertake generosity, Citta the householder passed away.</p>
