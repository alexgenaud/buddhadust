					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p>This sutta is based on a play on words. In everyday Pali, the term "consummate in faculties" is used to describe a person whose beauty and health are inspiring. Here the Buddha gives a different meaning to the term.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, 'Consummate in faculties, consummate in faculties,' it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent is one consummate in faculties?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a monk, while keeping track of arising and passing away with regard to the eye-faculty, becomes disenchanted with the eye-faculty; if, while keeping track of arising and passing away with regard to the ear-faculty... the nose-faculty... the tongue-faculty... the body faculty... the intellect-faculty, he becomes disenchanted with the intellect-faculty; and, disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate; through dispassion, he is released; with release, there is the knowledge, 'Released'; he discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world,' it is to this extent that one is consummate in faculties."</p>
