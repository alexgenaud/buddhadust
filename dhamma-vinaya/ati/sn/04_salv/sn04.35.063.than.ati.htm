					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Migajāla went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"'A person who is living alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person who is living alone,' thus it is said.</p>

					<p class="f4">To what extent, lord, is one a person who is living alone, and to what extent is one a person who is living with a companion?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Migajāla, there are forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire — and a monk relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them, delight arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being delight, he is impassioned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being impassioned, he is fettered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk joined with the fetter of delight is said to be a person who is living with a companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are sounds cognizable via the ear... aromas cognizable via the nose... flavors cognizable via the tongue... tactile sensations cognizable via the body... ideas cognizable via the intellect — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire — and a monk relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them, delight arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being delight, he is impassioned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being impassioned, he is fettered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk joined with the fetter of delight is said to be a person who is living with a companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"A person living in this way — even if he frequents isolated forest and wilderness dwellings, with an unpopulated atmosphere, lying far from humanity, appropriate for seclusion — is still said to be living with a companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the craving that is his companion has not been abandoned by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is said to be a person who is living with a companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, there are forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire — and a monk does not relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he doesn't relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them, delight ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no delight, he is not impassioned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being not impassioned, he is not fettered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk disjoined from the fetter of delight is said to be a person who is living alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are sounds cognizable via the ear... aromas cognizable via the nose... flavors cognizable via the tongue... tactile sensations cognizable via the body... ideas cognizable via the intellect — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire — and a monk does not relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he doesn't relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them, delight ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no delight, he is not impassioned.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being not impassioned, he is not fettered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A monk disjoined from the fetter of delight is said to be a person who is living alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">"A person living in this way — even if he lives near a village, associating with monks and nuns, with male and female lay followers, with kings and royal ministers, with sectarians and their disciples — is still said to be living alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">A person living alone is said to be a monk.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">Because the craving that is his companion has been abandoned by him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he is said to be a person who is living alone."</p>
