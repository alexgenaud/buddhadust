					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhakaputta the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The brahmans of the Western lands, lord — those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, and worship fire — can take (the spirit of) a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, and send it to heaven.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Blessed One, worthy and rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, a heavenly world."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, and holds to wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'Rise up, O boulder!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come floating up, O boulder!</p>

					<p class="f4">Come float to the shore, O boulder!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that boulder — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, and holds to wrong views.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even though a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart — (saying,) 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world!' — still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life, from stealing, and from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter; he is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, and holds to right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that man — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the shards and jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart (saying,) 'Sink, O ghee/oil!</p>

					<p class="f4">Submerge, O ghee/oil!</p>

					<p class="f4">Go down, O ghee/oil!'</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, and from indulging in illicit sex; refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter; is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, and holds to right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even though a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart — (saying,) 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell!' — still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, a heavenly world."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṇgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
