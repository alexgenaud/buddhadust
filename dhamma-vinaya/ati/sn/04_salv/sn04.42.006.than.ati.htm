					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p1" href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/sn/04_salv/sn04.42.006.pali.bd.htm#p1">1</a>][<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/sn/04_salv/sn04.42.006.wood.pts.htm#p1">pts</a>]</span> On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a id="nalanda">Nalanda</a> in the <a id="pavarika">Pavarika Mango Grove</a>. Then <a id="asi">Asibandhakaputta</a> the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "The brahmans of the Western lands, lord — those who carry water pots, wear garlands of water plants, purify with water, and worship fire — can take [the spirit of] a dead person, lift it out, instruct it, and send it to heaven. But the Blessed One, worthy and rightly self-awakened, can arrange it so that all the world, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Very well, then, headman, I will question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think: There is the case where a man is one who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, and holds to wrong views. Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' What do you think: would that man — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="boulder">Suppose</a> a man were to throw a large boulder into a deep lake of water, and a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Rise up, O boulder! Come floating up, O boulder! Come float to the shore, O boulder!' What do you think: would that boulder — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — rise up, come floating up, or come float to the shore?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is with any man who takes life, steals, indulges in illicit sex; is a liar, one who speaks divisive speech, harsh speech, and idle chatter; is greedy, bears thoughts of ill-will, and holds to wrong views. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart — [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world!' — still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now what do you think: There is the case where a man is one who refrains from taking life, from stealing, and from indulging in illicit sex; he refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter; he is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, and holds to right view. Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' What do you think: would that man — because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people — at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="jar">Suppose</a> a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break. There the shards and jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would come up. Then a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart [saying,] 'Sink, O ghee/oil! Submerge, O ghee/oil! Go down, O ghee/oil!' What do you think: would that ghee/oil, because of the prayers, praise, and circumambulation of that great crowd of people sink, submerge, or go down?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is with any man who refrains from taking life, from stealing, and from indulging in illicit sex; refrains from lying, from speaking divisive speech, from harsh speech, and from idle chatter; is not greedy, bears no thoughts of ill-will, and holds to right view. Even though a great crowd of people, gathering and congregating, would pray, praise, and circumambulate with their hands palm-to-palm over the heart — [saying,] 'May this man, at the break-up of the body, after death, reappear in a destitution, a bad destination, the lower realms, hell!' — still, at the break-up of the body, after death, he would reappear in a good destination, the heavenly world."</p>
					<p class="f4">When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: "<a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to point out the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the community of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
