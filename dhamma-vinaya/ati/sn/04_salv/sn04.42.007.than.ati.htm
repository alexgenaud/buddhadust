Then <a id="asi">Asibandhakaputta</a> the headman went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Lord, doesn't the Blessed One dwell with sympathy for the benefit of all beings?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, headman, the Tathāgata dwells with sympathy for the benefit of all beings."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then why is it that the Blessed One teaches the Dhamma with full attentiveness to some, and not with full attentiveness to others?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Very well then, headman, I will cross-question you on this matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think? There is the case where a farming householder has three fields: one excellent field, one middling, and one poor—sandy, salty, with bad soil. What do you think? If that farming householder wanted to sow seed, where would he sow the seed first: in the excellent field, in the middling field, or in the poor field—sandy, salty, with bad soil?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If that farming householder wanted to sow seed, lord, he would sow the seed first in the excellent field. Having sown it there, he would sow it in the middling field. Having sown it there, he might sow it in the poor field—sandy, salty, with bad soil—or he might not. Why is that? It would at least go toward cattle fodder."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In the same way, headman, like the excellent field are the monks &amp; nuns to me. I teach them the Dhamma that is admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end. I expound to them the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its meaning, entirely complete, surpassingly pure. Why is that? Because they live with me as their island, with me as their cave, with me as their shelter, with me as their refuge.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Like the middling field are the male &amp; female lay followers to me. I teach them the Dhamma that is admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end. I expound to them the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its meaning, entirely complete, surpassingly pure. Why is that? Because they live with me as their island, with me as their cave, with me as their shelter, with me as their refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Like the poor field—sandy, salty, with bad soil—are the followers of other sects to me: contemplatives, brahmans, &amp; wanderers. I teach them the Dhamma that is admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end. I expound to them the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its meaning, entirely complete, surpassingly pure. Why is that? (I think,) 'Perhaps they might understand even one sentence. That will be for their long-term benefit &amp; happiness.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Suppose, headman, that a man had three waterpots: one uncracked that doesn't let water seep out, one uncracked that lets water seep out, and one cracked that lets water seep out. What do you think? If that man wanted to store water, in which pot would he store it first: the uncracked one that doesn't let water seep out, the uncracked one that lets water seep out, or the cracked one that lets water seep out?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If that man wanted to store water, lord, he would store it first in the uncracked waterpot that doesn't let water seep out. Having stored it there, he would store it in the uncracked waterpot that lets water seep out. Having stored it there, he might store it in the cracked waterpot that lets water seep out, or he might not. Why is that? At least it could go toward washing dishes."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In the same way, headman, like the uncracked waterpot that doesn't let water seep out are the monks &amp; nuns to me. I teach them the Dhamma that is admirable in the beginning, admirable in the middle, admirable in the end. I expound to them the holy life both in its particulars &amp; in its meaning, entirely complete, surpassingly pure. Why is that? Because they live with me as their island, with me as their cave, with me as their shelter, with me as their refuge.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, lord! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear. I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, &amp; to the Saŋgha of monks. May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
