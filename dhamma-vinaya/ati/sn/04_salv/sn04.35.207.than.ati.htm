<meta name="description" content="The bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV: §35: Salayatana-samyutta, Sutta 207. The Buddha likens sense experience to a shief of wheat being beaten by six farmers, then he likens the desire for rebirth to that same shief of wheat being beaten again by a seventh farmer. He then instructs the bhikkhus that any notion of things being the self or belonging to the self, any theories sense of compunctioning such are vain, prideful assumptions with shaky unstable foundations." />

They would thrash the sheaf of barley with their six flails. Thus the sheaf of barley would be thoroughly thrashed with the six flails. Then a seventh man would come along with a flail in his hand. He would thrash the sheaf of barley with a seventh flail. Thus the sheaf of barley would be even more thoroughly thrashed with the seventh flail.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, the uninstructed run-of-the-mill person is thrashed in the eye by charming and pleasurable forms... thrashed in the ear by charming and pleasurable sounds... thrashed in the nose by charming and pleasurable aromas... thrashed in the tongue by charming and pleasurable flavors... thrashed in the body by charming and pleasurable tactile sensations... thrashed in the intellect by charming and pleasurable ideas. And if that uninstructed run-of-the-mill person forms intentions for the sake of further becoming in the future, then he — that foolish person — is even more thoroughly thrashed, just like the sheaf of barley thrashed with the seventh flail.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Once, monks, the devas and asuras were arrayed for battle. Then <a id="vepacitti">Vepacitti</a>, the lord of the asuras, addressed the asuras: 'If, dear sirs, in the battle of the devas arrayed against the asuras, the asuras win and the devas are defeated, bind Sakka, the lord of the devas, neck, hand, and foot and bring him before me in the city of the asuras.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"As for <a id="sakka">Sakka</a>, lord of the devas, he addressed the devas of the Thirty-three: 'If dear sirs, in the battle of the devas arrayed against the asuras, the devas win and the asuras are defeated, bind Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, neck, hand, and foot and bring him before me in the righteous assembly of the devas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, in that battle the devas won. So the devas of the Thirty-three bound Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, neck, hand, and foot and brought him before Sakka in the righteous assembly of the devas.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So there was Vepacitti, the lord of the asuras, bound neck, hand, and foot. When the thought occurred to him, 'The devas are in the right and the asuras are in the wrong. I'm now going over to the city of the devas,' then he viewed himself as freed from that fivefold bond. He was fully provided with the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality. But when the thought occurred to him, 'The asuras are in the right and the devas are in the wrong. I will go over to the city of the asuras,' then he viewed himself as bound with that fivefold bond, deprived of the fivefold strings of heavenly sensuality. That's how subtle the bonds of Vepacitti were. But the bonds of <a id="mara">Mara</a> are even more subtle. Anyone who construes is bound by Mara. Anyone who doesn't construe is freed from the Evil One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am' is a construing. 'I am this' is a construing. 'I shall be' is a construing. 'I shall not be'...'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is a construing. Construing is a disease, construing is a cancer, construing is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness free of construings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am' is a perturbation. 'I am this' is a perturbation. 'I shall be' is a perturbation. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is a perturbation. Perturbation is a disease, perturbation is a cancer, perturbation is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness free of perturbations.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am' is a wavering. 'I am this' is a wavering. 'I shall be' is a wavering. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is a wavering. Wavering is a disease, wavering is a cancer, wavering is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness free of waverings.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am' is a complication. 'I am this' is a complication. 'I shall be' is a complication. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is a complication. Complication is a disease, complication is a cancer, complication is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness free of complications.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'I am' is an act of conceit. 'I am this' is an act of conceit. 'I shall be' is an act of conceit. 'I shall not be'... 'I shall be possessed of form'... 'I shall not be possessed of form'... 'I shall be percipient'... 'I shall not be percipient'... 'I shall be neither percipient nor non-percipient' is an act of conceit. An act of conceit is a disease, an act of conceit is a cancer, an act of conceit is an arrow. Therefore, monks, you should train yourselves: 'We will dwell with an awareness free of acts of conceit.'"</p>
