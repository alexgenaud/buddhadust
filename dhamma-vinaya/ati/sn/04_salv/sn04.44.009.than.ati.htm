					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, a few days ago a large number of contemplatives, brahmans, and wanderers of various sects were sitting together in the Debating Hall when this conversation arose among them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Pūraṇa Kassapa — the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people — describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, Pūraṇa Kassapa describes him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"'This Makkhali Gosāla...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Sañjaya Velaṭṭhaputta...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Pakudha Kaccāna...</p>

					<p class="f4">This Ajita Kesakambala — the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people — describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">Even when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, Ajita Kesakambala describes him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"This contemplative Gotama — the leader of a community, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, honored and famous, esteemed as holy by the mass of people — describes a disciple who has died and passed on in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">But when the disciple is an ultimate person, a foremost person, attained to the foremost attainment, the contemplative Gotama does not describe him, when he has died and passed on, in terms of places of rebirth:</p>

					<p class="f4">"That one is reborn there; that one is reborn there."</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, he describes him thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"He has cut through craving, severed the fetter, and by rightly breaking through conceit has made an end of suffering and stress."'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So I was simply befuddled.</p>

					<p class="f4">I was uncertain:</p>

					<p class="f4">How is the teaching of Gotama the contemplative to be understood?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Of course you are befuddled, Vaccha. Of course you are uncertain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When there is a reason for befuddlement in you, uncertainty arises.</p>

					<p class="f4">I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance, Vaccha, and not of one without sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a fire burns with sustenance and not without sustenance, even so I designate the rebirth of one who has sustenance and not of one without sustenance."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Master Gotama, at the moment a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance, what do you designate as its sustenance then?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vaccha, when a flame is being swept on by the wind and goes a far distance, I designate it as wind-sustained, for the wind is its sustenance at that time."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And at the moment when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body, what do you designate as its sustenance then?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Vaccha, when a being sets this body aside and is not yet reborn in another body, I designate it as craving-sustained, for craving is its sustenance at that time."</p>
