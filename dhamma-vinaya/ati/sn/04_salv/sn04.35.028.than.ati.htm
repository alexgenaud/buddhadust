					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the All is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which All is aflame?</p>

					<p class="f4">The eye is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms are aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye-consciousness is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Eye-contact is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever there is that arises in dependence on eye-contact—experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame with what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame, I tell you, with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds are aflame...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The nose is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aromas are aflame...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The tongue is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Flavors are aflame...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The body is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Tactile sensations are aflame...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The intellect is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ideas are aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intellect-consciousness is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Intellect-contact is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever there is that arises in dependence on intellect-contact—experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain—that too is aflame.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame with what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame with the fire of passion, the fire of aversion, the fire of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">Aflame, I say, with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Seeing thus, the instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever there is that arises in dependence on eye-contact, experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows disenchanted.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He grows disenchanted with the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He grows disenchanted with the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He grows disenchanted with the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He grows disenchanted with the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He grows disenchanted with the intellect, disenchanted with ideas, disenchanted with intellect-consciousness, disenchanted with intellect-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">And whatever there is that arises in dependence on intellect-contact, experienced as pleasure, pain or neither-pleasure-nor-pain: With that, too, he grows disenchanted.</p>

					<p class="f4">Disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Through dispassion, he is released.</p>

					<p class="f4">With release, there is the knowledge, 'Released.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for this world.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while this explanation was being given, the minds of the 1,000 monks, through lack of clinging/sustenance, were released from effluents.</p>
