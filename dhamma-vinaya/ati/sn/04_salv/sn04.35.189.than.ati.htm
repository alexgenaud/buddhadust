					<p class="f4">Which six?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are forms, monks, cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has swallowed <a id="mara"></a>Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune and disaster. The Evil One can do with him as he will.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are sounds cognizable via the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are aromas cognizable via the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are flavors cognizable via the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are tactile sensations cognizable via the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">"There are ideas cognizable via the intellect — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk relishes them, welcomes them, and remains fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has swallowed Mara's hook, who has fallen into misfortune and disaster. The Evil One can do with him as he will.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now, there are forms cognizable via the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing. If a monk does not relish them, welcome them, or remain fastened to them, he is said to be a monk who has not swallowed Mara's hook, who has snapped the hook, who has broken the hook, who has not fallen into misfortune and disaster. The Evil One cannot do with him as he will.</p>
