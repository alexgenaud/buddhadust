					<h4>Translator's note</h4>

					<p>Although the Jains, like the Buddhists, teach a doctrine of the moral consequences of actions, the teachings of the two traditions differ in many important details. This discourse points out two of the major points where the Buddhist teaching is distinctive: its understanding of the complexity of the kammic process, and its application of that understanding to the psychology of teaching. The Buddha shows that a simplistic, fatalistic view of the kammic process is logically inconsistent, and also leads to unfortunate results for any person who, with a background of bad kamma, believes in it. The actual complexity of kamma, however, allows for a way in which past evil deeds can be overcome: through refraining from evil now and into the future, and through developing expansive mind-states of goodwill, compassion, empathetic joy, and equanimity. In such an expansive mind state, the unavoidable consequences of past evil actions count for next to nothing. The Buddha also shows how his method of teaching is better than that of the Jains in that it actually can help free the mind from debilitating feelings of guilt and remorse, and lead to the overcoming of past kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Asibandhakaputta the headman, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there the Blessed One said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Headman, how does Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta teach the Dhamma to his disciples?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples in this way, lord:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All those who take life are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who steal...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who indulge in illicit sex...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who tell lies are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led (to a state of rebirth).'</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta teaches the Dhamma to his disciples."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led (to a state of rebirth),' then no one is destined for a plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man is one who takes life, then taking into consideration time spent doing and not doing, whether by day or by night, which time is more: the time he spends taking life or the time he spends not taking life?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a man is one who takes life, lord, then taking into consideration time spent doing and not doing, whether by day or by night, then the time he spends taking life is less, and the time he spends not taking life is certainly more.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led (to a state of rebirth),' then no one is destined for a plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta's words."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What do you think, headman?</p>

					<p class="f4">If a man is one who steals... indulges in illicit sex... tells lies, then taking into consideration time spent doing and not doing, whether by day or by night, which time is more: the time he spends telling lies or the time he spends not telling lies?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If a man is one who tells lies, lord, then taking into consideration time spent doing and not doing, whether by day or by night, then the time he spends telling lies is less, and the time he spends not telling lies is certainly more.</p>

					<p class="f4">If it's true that 'Whatever one keeps doing frequently, by that is one led (to a state of rebirth),' then no one is destined for a plane of deprivation or destined to hell in line with Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta's words."</p>

					<p class="f4">"There's the case, headman, where a certain teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All those who take life are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who steal...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who indulge in illicit sex...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who tell lies are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A disciple has faith in that teacher, and the thought occurs to him, 'Our teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">"All those who take life are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell."</p>

					<p class="f4">There are living beings that I have killed.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, am destined for a plane of deprivation, am destined for hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He fastens onto that view.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he doesn't abandon that doctrine, doesn't abandon that state of mind, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus be placed in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"(The thought occurs to him,)</p>

					<p class="f4">'Our teacher holds this doctrine, holds this view:</p>

					<p class="f4">'All those who steal...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who indulge in illicit sex...</p>

					<p class="f4">All those who tell lies are destined for a plane of deprivation, are destined for hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">There are lies that I have told.</p>

					<p class="f4">I, too, am destined for a plane of deprivation, am destined for hell.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He fastens onto that view.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he doesn't abandon that doctrine, doesn't abandon that state of mind, doesn't relinquish that view, then as if he were to be carried off, he would thus be placed in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, headman, where a Tathāgata appears in the world, worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.</p>

					<p class="f4">He, in various ways, criticizes and censures the taking of life, and says, 'Abstain from taking life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He criticizes and censures stealing, and says, 'Abstain from stealing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He criticizes and censures indulging in illicit sex, and says, 'Abstain from indulging in illicit sex.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He criticizes and censures the telling of lies, and says, 'Abstain from the telling of lies.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"A disciple has faith in that teacher and reflects:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes and censures the taking of life, and says, "Abstain from taking life."</p>

					<p class="f4">There are living beings that I have killed, to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was not right.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was not good.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if I become remorseful for that reason, that evil deed of mine will not be undone.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, reflecting thus, he abandons right then the taking of life, and in the future refrains from taking life.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"(He reflects:)</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One in a variety of ways criticizes and censures stealing... indulging in illicit sex... the telling of lies, and says, "Abstain from the telling of lies."</p>

					<p class="f4">There are lies that I have told, to a greater or lesser extent.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was not right.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was not good.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if I become remorseful for that reason, that evil deed of mine will not be undone.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So, reflecting thus, he abandons right then the telling of lies, and in the future refrains from telling lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there comes to be the abandoning of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how there comes to be the transcending of that evil deed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having abandoned the taking of life, he refrains from taking life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned stealing, he refrains from stealing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned illicit sex, he refrains from illicit sex.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned lies, he refrains from lies.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned divisive speech, he refrains from divisive speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned harsh speech, he refrains from harsh speech.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned idle chatter, he refrains from idle chatter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned covetousness, he becomes uncovetous.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned ill will and anger, he becomes one with a mind of no ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having abandoned wrong views, he becomes one who has right views.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That disciple of the noble ones, headman — thus devoid of covetousness, devoid of ill will, unbewildered, alert, mindful — keeps pervading the first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with goodwill, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with goodwill — abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a strong conch-trumpet blower can notify the four directions without any difficulty, in the same way, when the awareness-release through goodwill is thus developed, thus pursued, any deed done to a limited extent no longer remains there, no longer stays there.</p>

					<p class="f4">"That disciple of the noble ones — thus devoid of covetousness, devoid of ill will, unbewildered, alert, mindful — keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion... empathetic joy... equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Asibandhakaputta the headman, the disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, lord!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṇgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
