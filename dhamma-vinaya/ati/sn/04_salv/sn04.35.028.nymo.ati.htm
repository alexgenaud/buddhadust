					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Gaya, at Gayasisa, together with a thousand bhikkhus. There he addressed the bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, all is burning. And what is the all that is burning?</p>

					<p class="f4">"The eye is burning, forms are burning, eye-consciousness is burning, eye-contact is burning, also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact for its indispensable condition, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion. I say it is burning with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with griefs, with despairs.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ear is burning, sounds are burning...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The nose is burning, odors are burning...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The tongue is burning, flavors are burning...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The body is burning, tangibles are burning...</p>

					<p class="f4">"The mind is burning, ideas are burning, mind-consciousness is burning, mind-contact is burning, also whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with mind-contact for its indispensable condition, that too is burning. Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion. I say it is burning with birth, aging and death, with sorrows, with lamentations, with pains, with griefs, with despairs.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, when a noble follower who has heard (the truth) sees thus, he finds estrangement in the eye, finds estrangement in forms, finds estrangement in eye-consciousness, finds estrangement in eye-contact, and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful- nor-pleasant that arises with eye-contact for its indispensable condition, in that too he finds estrangement.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He finds estrangement in the ear... in sounds...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He finds estrangement in the nose... in odors...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He finds estrangement in the tongue... in flavors...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He finds estrangement in the body... in tangibles...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He finds estrangement in the mind, finds estrangement in ideas, finds estrangement in mind-consciousness, finds estrangement in mind-contact, and whatever is felt as pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant that arises with mind-contact for its indispensable condition, in that too he finds estrangement.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When he finds estrangement, passion fades out. With the fading of passion, he is liberated. When liberated, there is knowledge that he is liberated. He understands: 'Birth is exhausted, the holy life has been lived out, what can be done is done, of this there is no more beyond.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were glad, and they approved his words.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now during his utterance, the hearts of those thousand bhikkhus were liberated from taints through clinging no more.</p>
