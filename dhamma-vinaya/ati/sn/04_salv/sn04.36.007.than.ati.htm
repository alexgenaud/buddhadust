					<p class="f4">Then, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, he went to the sick ward.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down, he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A monk should approach the time of death mindful and alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you all.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk mindful?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves... mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is mindful.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is a monk alert?</p>

					<p class="f4">When going forward and returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward and looking away... when bending and extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe, and his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, and savoring... when urinating and defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk is alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So a monk should approach the time of death mindful and alert.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is our instruction to you all.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As a monk is dwelling thus mindful and alert — heedful, ardent, and resolute — a feeling of pleasure arises in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'A feeling of pleasure has arisen in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on this body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, and dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of pleasure that has arisen be constant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body and to the feeling of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he remains focused on inconstancy... dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of pleasure, he abandons any passion-obsession for the body and the feeling of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he is dwelling thus mindful and alert — heedful, ardent, and resolute — a feeling of pain arises in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'A feeling of pain has arisen in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on this body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, and dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of pain that has arisen be constant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body and to the feeling of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he remains focused on inconstancy... dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of pain, he abandons any resistance-obsession for the body and the feeling of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"As he is dwelling thus mindful and alert — heedful, ardent, and resolute — a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain arises in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'A feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain has arisen in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is dependent on a requisite condition, not independent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on this body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, this body is inconstant, fabricated, dependently co-arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">Being dependent on a body that is inconstant, fabricated, and dependently co-arisen, how can this feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain that has arisen be constant?'</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on inconstancy with regard to the body and to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he remains focused on inconstancy... dissolution... dispassion... cessation... relinquishment with regard to the body and to the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he abandons any ignorance-obsession for the body and the feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sensing a feeling of pleasure, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a feeling of pain...</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he discerns that it is inconstant, not grasped at, not relished.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a feeling of pleasure, he senses it disjoined from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a feeling of pain...</p>

					<p class="f4">Sensing a feeling of neither-pleasure-nor-pain, he senses it disjoined from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is experienced, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just as an oil lamp burns in dependence on oil and wick; and from the termination of the oil and wick — and from not being provided any other sustenance — it goes out unnourished; in the same way, when sensing a feeling limited to the body, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to the body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When sensing a feeling limited to life, he discerns that 'I am sensing a feeling limited to life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns that 'With the break-up of the body, after the termination of life, all that is sensed, not being relished, will grow cold right here.'"</p>
