Godatta was staying near Macchikāsaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Citta the householder went to him and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Godatta said to him, "Householder, the immeasurable awareness-release, the nothingness awareness-release, the emptiness awareness-release, the themeless awareness-release: Are these phenomena different in meaning and different in name, or are they one in meaning and different only in name?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, there is a line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name, and there is a line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the line of reasoning by which they are different in meaning and different in name?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk keeps pervading the first direction [the east] with an awareness imbued with goodwill, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with goodwill—abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps pervading the first direction with an awareness imbued with compassion... empathetic joy... equanimity, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus above, below, and all around, everywhere, in its entirety, he keeps pervading the all-encompassing cosmos with an awareness imbued with equanimity—abundant, enlarged, immeasurable, without hostility, without ill will.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the immeasurable awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the nothingness awareness-release?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, with the complete transcending of the dimension of the infinitude of consciousness, thinking, 'There is nothing,' enters and remains in the dimension of nothingness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the nothingness awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the emptiness awareness-release?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, having gone into the wilderness, to the root of a tree, or into an empty dwelling, considers this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is empty of self or of anything pertaining to self.'<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the emptiness awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the themeless awareness-release?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, not attending to any theme (object of awareness) enters and remains in the themeless concentration of awareness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">This is called the themeless awareness-release.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are different in meaning and different in name.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which they are one in meaning and different only in name?</p>

					<p class="f4">Passion, venerable sir, is a making of measurement, aversion a making of measurement, delusion a making of measurement.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a monk whose effluents are ended these have been abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the extent that there are immeasurable awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is declared supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, empty of aversion, empty of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Passion is a something, aversion a something, delusion a something.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a monk whose effluents are ended these have been abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the extent that there are nothingness awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is declared supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, empty of aversion, empty of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Passion is a making of themes, aversion a making of themes, delusion a making of themes.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a monk whose effluents are ended these have been abandoned, their root destroyed, made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">To the extent that there are themeless awareness-releases, the unprovokable awareness-release is declared supreme.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that unprovokable awareness-release is empty of passion, empty of aversion, empty of delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This, venerable sir, is the line of reasoning by which these phenomena are one in meaning and different only in name."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's a gain for you, householder, a great gain: what your eye of discernment plumbs in the deep word of the Buddha."</p>
