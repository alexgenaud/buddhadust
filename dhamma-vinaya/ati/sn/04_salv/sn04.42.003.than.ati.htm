					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors that 'When a professional warrior strives and; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down and; slay him while he is striving and; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the Blessed One have to say about that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Enough, headman, put that aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't ask me that."</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time...</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Yodhājīva the headman said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir, I have heard that it has been passed down by the ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors that 'When a professional warrior strives and; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down and; slay him while he is striving and; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">What does the Blessed One have to say about that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Apparently, headman, I haven't been able to get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't ask me that.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So I will simply answer you.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a professional warrior strives and; exerts himself in battle, his mind is already seized, debased, and; misdirected by the thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May these beings be struck down or slaughtered or annihilated or destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">May they not exist.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If others then strike him down and; slay him while he is thus striving and; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the hell called the realm of those slain in battle.</p>

					<p class="f4">But if he holds such a view as this:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When a professional warrior strives and; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down and; slay him while he is striving and; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle,' that is his wrong view.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, there are two destinations for a person with wrong view, I tell you: either hell or the animal womb."</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Yodhājīva the headman sobbed and; burst into tears.</p>

					<p class="f4">(The Blessed One said:)</p>

					<p class="f4">"That is what I couldn't get past you by saying, 'Enough, headman, put that aside.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't ask me that.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I'm not crying, venerable sir, because of what the Blessed One said to me, but simply because I have been deceived, cheated, and; fooled for a long time by that ancient teaching lineage of professional warriors who said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When a professional warrior strives and; exerts himself in battle, if others then strike him down and; slay him while he is striving and; exerting himself in battle, then with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the company of devas slain in battle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, venerable sir!</p>

					<p class="f4">Magnificent!</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has the Blessed One — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṇgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May the Blessed One remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."</p>
