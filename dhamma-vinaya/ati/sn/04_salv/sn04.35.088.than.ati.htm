					<p class="f4"><i>When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "Here is where I am ill at ease, lord, for I don't discern, as they have come to be, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawback, and the escape from the six media of contact."</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>"Then what do you think, monk?</i></p>

					<p class="f4"><i>It is not what I am,' then the first medium of contact will be abandoned by you for the sake of no further becoming in the future.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Puṇṇa.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now that I have instructed you with a brief instruction, in which country are you going to live?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, there is a country called Sunāparanta.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am going to live there."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Puṇṇa, the Sunāparanta people are fierce.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are rough.</p>

					<p class="f4">If they insult and ridicule you, what will you think?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If they insult and ridicule me, I will think, 'These Sunāparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with their hands.'</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I will think, O Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I will think, O One Well-Gone."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if they hit you with their hands, what will you think?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...I will think, 'These Sunāparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a clod'..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if they hit you with a clod...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...I will think, 'These Sunāparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a stick'..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if they hit you with a stick...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...I will think, 'These Sunāparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't hit me with a knife'..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if they hit you with a knife...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"...I will think, 'These Sunāparanta people are civilized, very civilized, in that they don't take my life with a sharp knife'..."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But if they take your life with a sharp knife...?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"If they take my life with a sharp knife, I will think, 'There are disciples of the Blessed One who — horrified, humiliated, and disgusted by the body and by life — have sought for an assassin, but here I have met my assassin<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> without searching for him.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I will think, O Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what I will think, O One Well-Gone."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, Puṇṇa, very good.</p>

					<p class="f4">Possessing such calm and self-control you are fit to dwell among the Sunāparantans.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is time to do as you see fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Puṇṇa, delighting and rejoicing in the Blessed One's words, rising from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One and left, keeping him on his right side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Setting his dwelling in order and taking his robes and bowl, he set out for the Sunāparanta country and, after wandering stage by stage, he arrived there.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he lived.</p>

					<p class="f4">During that Rains retreat he established 500 male and 500 female lay followers in the practice, while he realized the three knowledges and then attained total [final] unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then a large number of monks went to the Blessed One and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As they were sitting there, they said to him, "Lord, the clansman named Puṇṇa, whom the Blessed One instructed with a brief instruction, has died.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his destination?</p>

					<p class="f4">What is his future state?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, the clansman Puṇṇa was wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">He practiced the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma and did not pester me with issues related to the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">The clansman Puṇṇa is totally unbound."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> <i>Satthahāraka.</i> Some scholars have objected that this word could not mean "assassin," on the grounds that it is a neuter noun, and Pali does not use neuter nouns to describe people, but that is not true. For example, <i>kaṇṭaka,</i> "thorn," another neuter noun, means "a subversive" — suggesting that neuter nouns were used to describe people as a way of showing disrespect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Even more to the point, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p12">MN 12</a> contains references to people who are <i>"hārakas"</i> — a <i>tiṇa-hārakaṁ,</i> or grass-carrier, and a <i>kaṭṭha-hārakaṁ,</i> or firewood carrier — showing that the suffix <i>–harakaṁ</i> can easily be used to indicate a person.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> In <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_54_anapanasamyutta.htm#p9">SN 54:9</a> and in the origin story to Pārājika 3, a group of monks search for an assassin after becoming disgusted with their bodies when taking the unattractiveness of the body as their meditation theme. The Buddha, on learning of this, convenes the remaining monks and recommends that if they find such unskillful, aversive attitudes arising in their meditation, they should switch to the breath as their theme. Thus — contrary to some interpretations of this discourse — it seems unlikely that Puṇṇa is here extolling the act of searching for an assassin as a skillful approach toward death. Instead, the gist of his statement is that if he died under the circumstances described here, death would have found him without his having sought for it through aversion. This would parallel the attitude toward death that the Theragāthā frequently attributes to arahants:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">I don't delight in death,<br />
							don't delight in living.<br />
							I await my time<br />
							like a worker his wage.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">I don't delight in death,<br />
							don't delight in living.<br />
							I await my time<br />
							mindful, alert.</p>

							<p class="f1 in2">— <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/thag/idx_thag.htm#p244">Thag 14:1</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt">This may not be life affirming in the American sense of the word, but it does affirm that the arahants have awakened to a release that transcends life and death. And that is the whole point of Dhamma practice. If there were nothing more important than life, then life itself would be pointless.</p>
