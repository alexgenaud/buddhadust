Although a Wheel-Turning King conquers the world and after death his immediate rebirth is in the Heaven of the Three and Thirty Gods, he has not escaped rebirth as an animal, deamon or in hell, whereas a disciple of the Buddha, if he have faith in the Buddha, Dhamma and Saŋgha and is of virtuous character has escaped for all time these low rebirths." />

There the Blessed One said, "Monks, even though a wheel-turning emperor, having exercised sovereign lordship over the four continents, on the break-up of the body, after death, reappears in the good destination, the heavenly world, in the company of the devas of the Thirty-three, and enjoys himself there in the <a id="nandana">Nandana grove</a>, surrounded by a consort of nymphs, supplied and endowed with the five strings of heavenly sensual pleasure, still — because he is not endowed with four qualities — he is not freed from [the possibility of going to] hell, not freed from the animal womb, not freed from the realm of hungry shades, not freed from the plane of deprivation, the bad destinations, the lower realms.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what are the four? There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>
