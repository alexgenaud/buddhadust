					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, remaining focused on the body in and of itself, the body is comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the comprehension of the body, the deathless is realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, remaining focused on feelings in and of themselves, feelings are comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the comprehension of feelings, the deathless is realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on the mind in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, remaining focused on the mind in and of itself, the mind is comprehended.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the comprehension of the mind, the deathless is realized.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, remaining focused on mental qualities in and of themselves, mental qualities are comprehended.</p>
