					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "I will teach and analyze for you the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Now what, monks, is the noble eightfold path?</p>

					<p class="f4">Right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right view?</p>

					<p class="f4">Knowledge with regard to [or: in terms of] stress, knowledge with regard to the origination of stress, knowledge with regard to the stopping of stress, knowledge with regard to the way of practice leading to the stopping of stress:</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right view.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right resolve?</p>

					<p class="f4">Resolve for renunciation, resolve for non-ill will, resolve for harmlessness:</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right resolve.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right speech?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from lying, abstaining from divisive speech, abstaining from harsh speech, abstaining from idle chatter:</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right speech.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right action?</p>

					<p class="f4">Abstaining from taking life, abstaining from stealing, abstaining from sexual intercourse<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right action.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right livelihood?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones, having abandoned dishonest livelihood, keeps his life going with right livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right effort?</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) He generates desire, endeavors, activates persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right effort.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right mindfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) He remains focused on the mind in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) He remains focused on mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right mindfulness.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"And what, monks, is right concentration?</p>

					<p class="f4">(i) There is the case where a monk — quite secluded from sensuality,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> secluded from unskillful qualities<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> — enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.</p>

					<p class="f4">(ii) With the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, he enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance.</p>

					<p class="f4">(iii) With the fading of rapture, he remains equanimous, mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">He enters and remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, he has a pleasant abiding.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(iv) With the abandoning of pleasure and pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, monks, is called right concentration."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
