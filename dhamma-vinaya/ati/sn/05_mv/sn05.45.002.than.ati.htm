<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya V: Maha Vagga; Chapter 45: Magga Samyutta, Sutta 2.  Ānanda, probably speaking of friendship with other beggars, declares that it is 'half of the Brahma life' to be associated with the lovely. Gotama corrects him saying it is the whole of the Brahma life, but he is speaking of a close association and companionship with the Dhamma." />

					<p class="f4">Now there is a Sakyan town named Sakkara.</p>

					<p class="f4">There Ven. Ānanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Ānanda said to the Blessed One, "This is half of the holy life, lord: having admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues."<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"Don't say that, Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">Don't say that.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, he can be expected to develop and pursue the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, develop and pursue the noble eightfold path?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk develops right view dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops right resolve... right speech... right action... right livelihood... right effort... right mindfulness... right concentration dependent on seclusion, dependent on dispassion, dependent on cessation, resulting in relinquishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk who has admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues, develops and pursues the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And through this line of reasoning one may know how having admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is in dependence on me as an admirable friend that beings subject to birth have gained release from birth, that beings subject to aging have gained release from aging, that beings subject to death have gained release from death, that beings subject to sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair have gained release from sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is through this line of reasoning that one may know how having admirable people as friends, companions, and colleagues is actually the whole of the holy life."</p>
