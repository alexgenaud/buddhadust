					<p class="f4">Then the quail, as it was being carried off by the hawk, lamented, 'O, just my bad luck and lack of merit that I was wandering out of my proper range and into the territory of others!</p>

					<p class="f4">If only I had kept to my proper range today, to my own ancestral territory, this hawk would have been no match for me in battle.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'But what is your proper range?' the hawk asked.</p>

					<p class="f4">'What is your own ancestral territory?'</p>

					<p class="f4">"'A newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So the hawk, without bragging about its own strength, without mentioning its own strength, let go of the quail.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Go, quail, but even when you have gone there you won't escape me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Then the quail, having gone to a newly plowed field with clumps of earth all turned up and climbing up on top of a large clump of earth, stood taunting the hawk, 'Now come and get me, you hawk!</p>

					<p class="f4">Now come and get me, you hawk!'</p>

					<p class="f4">"So the hawk, without bragging about its own strength, without mentioning its own strength, folded its two wings and suddenly swooped down toward the quail.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the quail knew, 'The hawk is coming at me full speed,' it slipped behind the clump of earth, and right there the hawk shattered its own breast.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"For this reason, you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others, Māra gains an opening, Māra gains a foothold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, for a monk, is not his proper range and is the territory of others?</p>

					<p class="f4">The five strings of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable by the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognizable by the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">Aromas cognizable by the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">Flavors cognizable by the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">Tactile sensations cognizable by the body — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, for a monk, are not his proper range and are the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wander, monks, in what is your proper range, your own ancestral territory.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who wanders in what is his proper range, his own ancestral territory, Māra gains no opening, Māra gains no foothold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral territory?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves... mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral territory."</p>
