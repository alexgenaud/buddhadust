					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, is there a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner,'<br />
					and whereby a monk who is an adept,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, and their arbitrator.<br />
					It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement.<br />
					Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, monks, listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said,</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner,'<br />
					and whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner'?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is a learner.<br />
					He discerns, as it has come to be, that<br />
					'This is stress...<br />
					This is the origination of stress...<br />
					This is the cessation of stress...<br />
					This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is a learner reflects,<br />
					'Is there outside of this [doctrine and discipline] any priest or contemplative who teaches the true, genuine, and accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns,</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, there is no priest or contemplative outside of this doctrine and discipline who teaches the true, genuine, and accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties:<br />
					the faculty of conviction...<br />
					persistence...<br />
					mindfulness...<br />
					concentration...<br />
					discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees clear through with discernment their destiny, excellence, rewards, and consummation, but he does not touch them with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept'?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties:<br />
					the faculty of conviction...<br />
					persistence...<br />
					mindfulness...<br />
					concentration...<br />
					discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their destiny, excellence, rewards, and consummation are.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties:<br />
					the faculty of the eye...<br />
					ear...<br />
					nose...<br />
					tongue...<br />
					body...<br />
					intellect.<br />
					He discerns,<br />
					'These six sense faculties will disband entirely, everywhere, and in every way without remainder,<br />
					and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'"</p>
