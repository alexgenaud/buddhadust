					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks, is there a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner [i.e., a person who has attained at least stream-entry, but has not yet reached arahantship], standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner,' and whereby a monk who is an adept [i.e., an arahant], standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept'?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, and their arbitrator.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, monks, listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "There is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner,' and whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner'?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk is a learner.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the origination of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the cessation of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is a learner reflects, 'Is there outside of this (Dhamma and Vinaya) any contemplative or brahman who teaches the true, genuine, and accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he discerns, 'No, there is no contemplative or brahman outside of this who teaches the true, genuine, and accurate Dhamma like the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is a learner discerns the five faculties: the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He sees clear through with discernment their destiny, excellence, rewards, and consummation, but he does not touch them with his body.</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is a learner, standing at the level of a learner, can discern that 'I am a learner.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept'?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk who is an adept discerns the five faculties: the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">He touches with his body and sees clear through with discernment what their destiny, excellence, rewards, and consummation are.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the monk who is an adept discerns the six sense faculties: the faculty of the eye... ear... nose...tongue... body... intellect.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns, 'These six sense faculties will disband entirely, everywhere, and in every way without remainder, and no other set of six sense faculties will arise anywhere or in any way.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This too is a manner of reckoning whereby a monk who is an adept, standing at the level of an adept, can discern that 'I am an adept.'"</p>
