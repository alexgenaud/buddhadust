					<p class="f4">"Is it the case that whoever sees stress also sees the origination of stress, the cessation of stress, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Gavampati the Elder said, "Face to face with the Blessed One did I hear this, friends, face to face did I receive it:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Monks, whoever sees stress also sees the origination of stress, the cessation of stress, and the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>
