					<p class="f4">When this was said, one of the monks said to the Blessed One, "Wow, what a great darkness! What a really great darkness! Is there any darkness greater and more frightening than that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is, monk, a darkness greater and more frightening than that."</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which darkness, lord, is greater and more frightening than that?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any priests or contemplatives who do not know, as it has come to be, that 'This is stress';<br />

					Reveling in fabrications leading to birth... aging... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair,<br />

					<p class="f4">Fabricating fabrications leading to birth... aging... death... sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair,<br />

					They are not totally released from birth, aging, death, sorrows, lamentations, pains, distresses, and despairs.<br />
					They are not totally released, I tell you, from suffering and stress.</p>
