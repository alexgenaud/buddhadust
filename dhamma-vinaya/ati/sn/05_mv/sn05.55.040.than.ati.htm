					<p class="f4">Then Nandiya the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, the disciple of the noble ones in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether and in every way lacking: Is he called a disciple of the noble ones who lives heedlessly?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Nandiya, the person in whom the factors of stream entry are altogether and in every way lacking I call an outsider, one who stands in the faction of the run-of-the-mill.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to how a disciple of the noble ones dwells in heedlessness and dwells in heedfulness, listen well and pay attention, I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Nandiya the Sakyan responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones dwell in heedlessness?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Content with that verified confidence in the Awakened One, he doesn't exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, dwelling thus heedlessly, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When pained, the mind doesn't become concentrated.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is unconcentrated, phenomena don't become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren't manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Content with that verified confidence in the Dhamma, he doesn't exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, dwelling thus heedlessly, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When pained, the mind doesn't become centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered, phenomena don't become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren't manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the 'The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples: deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Content with that verified confidence in the Saṅgha, he doesn't exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, dwelling thus heedlessly, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When pained, the mind doesn't become centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered, phenomena don't become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren't manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Content with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones, he doesn't exert himself further in solitude by day or seclusion by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, dwelling thus heedlessly, there is no joy.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no joy, there is no rapture.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no rapture, there is no calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">There being no calm, he dwells in pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is uncentered, phenomena don't become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena aren't manifest, he is reckoned simply as one who dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how a disciple of the noble ones dwells in heedlessness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how, Nandiya, does a disciple of the noble ones dwell in heedfulness?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One....</p>

					<p class="f4">Not content with that verified confidence in the Awakened One, he exerts himself further in solitude by day and seclusion by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">For him, dwelling thus heedfully, joy is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who has joy, rapture is born.</p>

					<p class="f4">The body of one enraptured at heart grows calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the body is calm, one feels pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling pleasure, the mind becomes centered.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the mind is centered, phenomena become manifest.</p>

					<p class="f4">When phenomena are manifest, he is reckoned as one who dwells in heedfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma.... verified confidence in the Saṅgha... virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not content with those virtues pleasing to the noble ones, he exerts himself further in solitude by day and seclusion by night.</p>
