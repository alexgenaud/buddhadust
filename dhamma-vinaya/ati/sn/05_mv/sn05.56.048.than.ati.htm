A wind from the east would push it west, a wind from the west would push it east. A wind from the north would push it south, a wind from the south would push it north. And suppose a blind sea-turtle were there. It would come to the surface once every one hundred years. Now what do you think: would that blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It would be a sheer coincidence, lord, that the blind sea-turtle, coming to the surface once every one hundred years, would stick his neck into the yoke with a single hole."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It's likewise a sheer coincidence that one obtains the human state. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a Tathāgata, worthy and rightly self-awakened, arises in the world. It's likewise a sheer coincidence that a doctrine and discipline expounded by a Tathāgata appears in the world. Now, this human state has been obtained. A Tathāgata, worthy and rightly self-awakened, has arisen in the world. A doctrine and discipline expounded by a Tathāgata appears in the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore your duty is the contemplation: 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"</p>
