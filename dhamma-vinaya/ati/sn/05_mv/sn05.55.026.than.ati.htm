					<p class="f4">Now, on that occasion Anāthapiṇḍika the householder was diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he said to one of his men, "Come, my good man.</p>

					<p class="f4">Go to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, pay homage to his feet with your head in my name and say 'Venerable sir, Anāthapiṇḍika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to your feet.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then say:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It would be good if Ven. Sāriputta would visit Anāthapiṇḍika's home, out of sympathy for him.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">Responding, "As you say, lord," to Anāthapiṇḍika the householder, the man went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said, "Venerable sir, Anāthapiṇḍika the householder is diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">He pays homage with his head to your feet."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he said, "It would be good if Ven. Sāriputta would visit Anāthapiṇḍika's home, out of sympathy for him."</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta acquiesced with silence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then early in the morning, Ven. Sāriputta — having adjusted his under robe and carrying his bowl and outer robe — went to Anāthapiṇḍika's home with Ven. Ānanda as his companion.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Seated, he said to Anāthapiṇḍika:</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope you are getting better, householder.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not getting better, venerable sir.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of suspicion<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> of the Buddha endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have verified confidence in the Buddha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As you see that verified confidence in the Buddha in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of suspicion of the Dhamma endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As you see that verified confidence in the Dhamma in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of suspicion of the Saṅgha endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have verified confidence in the Saṅgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> — they are the Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">As you see that verified confidence in the Saṅgha in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of poor virtue endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have virtues appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">As you see those virtues appealing to the noble ones in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of wrong view endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have right view.</p>

					<p class="f4">As you see that right view in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Householder, you don't have the type of wrong resolve... wrong speech... wrong action... wrong livelihood... wrong effort... wrong mindfulness... wrong concentration... wrong knowledge... wrong release endowed with which an uninstructed run-of-the-mill person — with the breakup of the body, after death — re-appears in a plane of deprivation, a bad destination, a lower realm, hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">You have right release.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">As you see that right release in yourself, your pains may immediately grow calm."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anāthapiṇḍika's pains immediately grew calm.</p>

					<p class="f4">So he served Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Ānanda from his very own dish.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when Ven. Sāriputta had finished his meal and had rinsed his bowl and hands, Anāthapiṇḍika the householder, taking a low seat, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, Ven. Sāriputta gave his approval with these verses:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">One whose conviction in the Tathāgata<br />
							is well-established, unshakable;<br />
							whose virtue is admirable,<br />
							appealing to the noble ones, praised;<br />
							who has confidence in the Saṅgha,<br />
							and vision made straight:<br />
							"Not poor," they say of him.<br />
							Not in vain his life.<br />
							So conviction and virtue,<br />
							confidence and Dhamma-vision<br />
							should be cultivated by the intelligent,<br />
							remembering the Buddhas' teachings.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, having given his approval to Anāthapiṇḍika the householder, got up from his seat and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Ānanda went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "Well, now, Ānanda, where are you coming from in the middle of the day?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, Anāthapiṇḍika the householder was instructed by Ven. Sāriputta with this and this instruction."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta is wise, Ānanda, and greatly discerning, in that he analyzes the four factors of stream entry into ten implications."</p>
