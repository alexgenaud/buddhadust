					<p class="f4">Now on that occasion the Blessed One,<br />
					with many lines of reasoning,<br />
					was giving the monks a talk on the unattractiveness [of the body],<br />
					was speaking in praise of [the perception of] unattractiveness,<br />
					was speaking in praise of the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, I wish to go into seclusion for half a month.<br />
					I am not to be approached by anyone at all<br />
					except for the one who brings almsfood."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord,"<br />
					the monks responded to him.<br />
					And no one approached the Blessed One<br />
					except for the one who brought almsfood.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the monks &mdash; [thinking,]</p>

					<p class="f4">"The Blessed One,<br />
					with many lines of reasoning,<br />
					has given a talk on the unattractiveness [of the body],<br />
					has spoken in praise of [the perception of] unattractiveness,<br />
					has spoken in praise of the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness" &mdash;<br />
					remained committed to the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness in many modes and manners.</p>

					<p class="f4">They<br />
					&mdash; ashamed, repelled, and disgusted with this body &mdash;<br />
					sought for an assassin.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one day, ten monks took the knife.<br />
					In one day, twenty monks took the knife.<br />
					In one day, thirty monks took the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion after half a month's time, said to <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a>,</p>

					<p class="f4">"Ānanda, why does the community of monks seem so depleted?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Because, lord, the Blessed One,<br />
					with many lines of reasoning,<br />
					gave the monks a talk on the unattractiveness [of the body],<br />
					spoke in praise of [the perception of] unattractiveness,<br />
					spoke in praise of the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The monks &mdash; [thinking,]</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Blessed One, with many lines of reasoning,<br />
					has given a talk on the unattractiveness [of the body],<br />
					has spoken in praise of [the perception of] unattractiveness,<br />
					has spoken in praise of the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness'<br />
					&mdash; remained committed to the development of [the perception of] unattractiveness in many modes and manners.</p>

					<p class="f4">They<br />
					&mdash; ashamed, repelled, and disgusted with this body &mdash;<br />
					sought for an assassin.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one day, ten monks took the knife.<br />
					In one day, twenty monks took the knife.<br />
					In one day, thirty monks took the knife.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would explain another method so that this community of monks might be established in gnosis."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Ānanda, gather in the assembly hall all the monks who live in dependence on Vesali."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Ānanda responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had gathered in the assembly hall all the monks who lived in dependence on Vesali,<br />
					he went to the Blessed One and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"The community of monks is gathered, lord.<br />
					Now is the time to do as the Blessed One sees fit."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One went to the assembly hall and sat down on a seat made ready.<br />
					As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, this concentration through mindfulness of in-and-out breathing,<br />
					when developed and pursued,<br />
					is both peaceful and exquisite,<br />
					a refreshing and pleasant abiding<br />
					that immediately disperses and allays<br />
					any evil, unskillful [mental] qualities<br />
					that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="raincloud">Just as</a> when, in the last month of the hot season,<br />
					a great rain-cloud out of season<br />
					immediately disperses and allays<br />
					the dust and dirt that have been stirred up,<br />
					in the same way<br />
					this concentration through mindfulness of in-and-out breathing,<br />
					when developed and pursued,<br />
					is both peaceful and exquisite,<br />
					a refreshing and pleasant abiding<br />
					that immediately disperses and allays<br />
					any evil, unskillful [mental] qualities that have arisen.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is concentration through mindfulness of in-and-out breathing<br />
					developed and pursued so as to be both peaceful and exquisite,<br />
					a refreshing and pleasant abiding that immediately disperses and allays<br />
					any evil, unskillful [mental] qualities that have arisen?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk,<br />
					having gone to the wilderness,<br />
					to the shade of a tree,<br />
					or to an empty building,<br />
					sits down folding his legs crosswise,<br />
					holding his body erect,<br />
					and setting mindfulness to the fore.<br />
					Always mindful, he breathes in;<br />
					mindful he breathes out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"[1] Breathing in long, he discerns,<br />
					'I am breathing in long';<br />
					or breathing out long, he discerns,<br />
					'I am breathing out long.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[2] Or breathing in short, he discerns,<br />
					'I am breathing in short';<br />
					or breathing out short, he discerns,<br />
					'I am breathing out short.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[3] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[4] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication [in-and-out breathing].'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />

					'I will breathe out sensitive to mental fabrication.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[8] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in calming mental fabrication.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out calming mental fabrication.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"[9] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in sensitive to the mind.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out sensitive to the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[10] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in gladdening the mind.'<br />
					He trains himself, 'I will breathe out gladdening the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[11] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in steadying the mind.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out steadying the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">[12] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in releasing the mind.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out releasing the mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"[13] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in focusing on inconstancy.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out focusing on inconstancy.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[14] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in focusing on dispassion <i>[literally,</i> fading].'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out focusing on dispassion.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[15] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in focusing on cessation.'<br />
					He trains himself, 'I will breathe out focusing on cessation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">[16] He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe in focusing on relinquishment.'<br />
					He trains himself,<br />
					'I will breathe out focusing on relinquishment.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how concentration through mindfulness of in-and-out breathing is developed and pursued so as to be both peaceful and exquisite,<br />
					a refreshing and pleasant abiding<br />
					that immediately disperses and allays<br />
					any evil, unskillful [mental] qualities that have arisen."</p>
