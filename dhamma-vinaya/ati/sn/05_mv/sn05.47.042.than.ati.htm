There he addressed the monks, saying, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "I will teach and analyze for you the origination and subsiding of the four establishings of mindfulness. Listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "And what, monks, is the origination of the body?<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">From the origination of nutriment is the origination of the body. From the cessation of nutriment is the subsiding of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the origination of contact is the origination of feeling. From the cessation of contact is the subsiding of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the origination of name-and-form is the origination of the mind. From the cessation of name-and-form is the cessation of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"From the origination of attention is the origination of mental qualities.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> From the cessation of attention is the subsiding of mental qualities."</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> This discourse is unusual in that it identifies the word <i>satipatthana</i>, not with the standard formula of the process of establishing mindfulness, but with the objects that form the frame of reference for that process. For example, instead of identifying the first satipatthana as, "There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world," it identifies it simply as "body."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Mental qualities = <i>dhammas.</i> <a href='sn05.46.051.than.ati.htm'>SN 46.51</a> discusses the ways in which inappropriate attention feeds such unskillful qualities as the hindrances, whereas appropriate attention feeds such skillful qualities as the factors for awakening.<br />
					<i>Dhammas</i> can also mean "phenomena," "events," or "actions." It is apparently in connection with these three meanings that <a href='../../an/10_tens/an10.058.than.ati.htm'>AN 10.58</a> lists three factors underlying the appearance of dhammas:<br />
					"All phenomena are rooted in desire.<br />
					"All phenomena come into play through attention.<br />
					"All phenomena have contact as their origination."</p>
