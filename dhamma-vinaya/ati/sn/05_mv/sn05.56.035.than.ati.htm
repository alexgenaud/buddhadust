The Buddha aserts that even if a man were to be pierced with 300 spears every day for a hundred years, it would be worth it to endure it, to even consider it a pleasure, were it to happen that at the end of that hundred years one were to awaken to the Four Aristocratic Truths." />

					<p class="f4">Someone would say to him,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Look here, fellow.</p>

					<p class="f4">They will stab you at dawn with 100 spears, at noon with 100 spears, and again at evening with 100 spears.</p>

					<p class="f4">You, thus stabbed day after day with 300 spears, will have a lifespan of 100 years, will live to be 100, and at the end of 100 years you will realize the four noble truths that you have never realized before.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, a person who desired his own true benefit would do well to take up (the offer).</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not evident for the (pain of) blows from spears, swords, and axes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Even if this (offer) were to occur, I tell you that the realization of the four noble truths would not be accompanied by pain and distress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Instead, I tell you, the realization of the four noble truths would be accompanied by pleasure and happiness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">The noble truth of stress, the noble truth of the origination of stress, the noble truth of the cessation of stress, and the noble truth of the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Therefore your duty is the contemplation,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the origination of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the cessation of stress...</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the path of practice leading to the cessation of stress.'"</p>
