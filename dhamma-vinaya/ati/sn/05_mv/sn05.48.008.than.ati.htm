					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Pali for "stream-entry factor," <i>sotāpattiyaṇga,</i> can be read either as factor <i>for</i> stream-entry or factor <i>of</i> stream-entry. Adopting the first reading, this passage could be referring to the four factors leading to stream-entry listed in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_55_sotapattisamyutta.htm#p5">SN 55:5</a>: "Association with good people is a factor for stream-entry. Listening to the true Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry. Appropriate attention is a factor for stream-entry. Practice of the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma is a factor for stream-entry."</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">Adopting the second reading, the passage could be referring to the four factors with which, according to <a href="../../../../">AN 10:92</a>, a stream-winner is endowed:</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"Now with which four factors of stream-entry is the disciple of the noble ones endowed? There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.'</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"He is endowed with verified confidence in the Saṇgha: 'The Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"He is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> "There are these four right exertions. Which four? There is the case where a monk generates desire, endeavors, arouses persistence, upholds and exerts his intent for the sake of the non-arising of evil, unskillful qualities that have not yet arisen... for the sake of the abandoning of evil, unskillful qualities that have arisen... for the sake of the arising of skillful qualities that have not yet arisen... (and) for the maintenance, non-confusion, increase, plenitude, development, and culmination of skillful qualities that have arisen. These are the four right exertions."  —  <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_49_sammappadhanasamyutta.htm#p1">SN 49:1</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Now, what is the establishing of mindfulness? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. This is called the establishing of mindfulness."  —  <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_47_satipatthanasamyutta.htm#p40">SN 47:40</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> "Quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities — one enters and remains in the first jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought and evaluation. With the stilling of directed thoughts and evaluations, one enters and remains in the second jhāna: rapture and pleasure born of concentration, unification of awareness free from directed thought and evaluation — internal assurance. With the fading of rapture, one remains equanimous, mindful, and alert, and senses pleasure with the body. One enters and remains in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one has a pleasant abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure and pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation and distress — one enters and remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity and mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain."  —  <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_48_indriyasamyutta.htm#p10">SN 48:10</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> "Now this, monks, is the noble truth of stress: Birth is stressful, aging is stressful, death is stressful; sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair are stressful; association with the unbeloved is stressful; separation from the loved is stressful; not getting what is wanted is stressful. In short, the five clinging-aggregates are stressful.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And this, monks, is the noble truth of the origination of stress: the craving that makes for further becoming — accompanied by passion and delight, relishing now here and now there — i.e., craving for sensuality, craving for becoming, craving for non-becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And this, monks, is the noble truth of the cessation of stress: the remainderless fading and cessation, renunciation, relinquishment, release, and letting go of that very craving.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And this, monks, is the noble truth of the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress: precisely this noble eightfold path — right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration."</p>
