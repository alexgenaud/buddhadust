Understanding the five forces (indriana), their advantages, their disadvantages and the escape from them and having become free without more to be done, one is called an Arahant, has destroyed the corrupting influences, has lived the godly life, done one's duty, won one's best interests, laid down the load, worn out the yokes to rebirth, become one released by the highest knowing." />

					<p class="f4">When — having discerned, as they have come to be, the origination, the passing away, the allure, the drawbacks, and the escape from these five faculties — a monk is released from lack of clinging/sustenance, he is called an arahant whose effluents are ended, who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, laid to waste the fetter of becoming, and who is released through right gnosis."</p>
