					at <a id="ghosita">Ghosita</a>'s Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the <a id="unnabha">Brahman Unnabha</a> went to where Ven. Ānanda was staying<br />
					and on arrival greeted him courteously.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies,<br />
					he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there,<br />
					he said to Ven. Ānanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Master Ānanda, what is the aim of this holy life<br />
					lived under the contemplative Gotama?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, the holy life is lived under the Blessed One<br />
					with the aim of abandoning desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Is there a path,<br />
					is there a practice,<br />
					for the abandoning of that desire?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, there is a path,<br />
					there is a practice,<br />
					for the abandoning of that desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"What is the path,<br />
					the practice,<br />
					for the abandoning of that desire?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Brahman, there is the case where a monk develops<br />
					the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire and the fabrications of exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence and the fabrications of exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on intent and the fabrications of exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination and the fabrications of exertion.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, Brahman, is the path,<br />
					this is the practice<br />
					for the abandoning of that desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"If that's so, Master Ānanda,<br />
					then it's an endless path,<br />
					and not one with an end,<br />
					for it's impossible<br />
					that one could abandon desire<br />
					by means of desire."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, brahman,<br />
					let me question you on this matter.</p>

					<p class="f4">Answer as you see fit.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think:</p>

					<p class="f4">Didn't you first have desire,<br />
					thinking, 'I'll go to the park,'<br />
					and then when you reached the park,<br />
					wasn't that particular desire allayed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Didn't you first have persistence,<br />
					thinking, 'I'll go to the park,'<br />
					and then when you reached the park,<br />
					wasn't that particular persistence allayed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Didn't you first have the intent,<br />
					thinking, 'I'll go to the park,'<br />
					and then when you reached the park,<br />
					wasn't that particular intent allayed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Didn't you first have [an act of] discrimination,<br />
					thinking, 'I'll go to the park,'<br />
					and then when you reached the park,<br />
					wasn't that particular act of discrimination allayed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, sir."</p>

					<p class="f4">"So it is with an Arahant<br />
					whose mental effluents are ended,<br />
					who has reached fulfillment,<br />
					done the task,<br />
					laid down the burden,<br />
					attained the true goal,<br />
					totally destroyed the fetter of becoming,<br />
					and who is released<br />
					through right gnosis.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever desire he first had<br />
					for the attainment of Arahantship,<br />
					on attaining Arahantship<br />
					that particular desire is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever persistence he first had<br />
					for the attainment of Arahantship,<br />
					on attaining Arahantship<br />
					that particular persistence is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever intent he first had<br />
					for the attainment of Arahantship,<br />
					on attaining Arahantship<br />
					that particular intent is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever discrimination he first had<br />
					for the attainment of Arahantship,<br />
					on attaining Arahantship<br />
					that particular discrimination is allayed.</p>

					<p class="f4">So what do you think, brahman?</p>

					<p class="f4">Is this an endless path,<br />
					or one with an end?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"You're right, Master Ānanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is a path with an end,<br />
					and not an endless one.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="magnif">Magnificent</a>, Master Ānanda!<br />
					Magnificent!<br />
					Just as if he were to place upright<br />
					what was overturned,<br />
					to reveal what was hidden,<br />
					to show the way<br />
					to one who was lost,<br />
					or to carry a lamp into the dark<br />
					so that those with eyes could see forms,<br />
					in the same way has Master Ānanda —<br />
					through many lines of reasoning —<br />
					made the Dhamma clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">I go to Master Gotama for refuge,<br />
					to the Dhamma,<br />
					and to the Saŋgha of monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">May Master Ānanda remember me<br />
					as a lay follower who has gone for refuge,<br />
					from this day forward, for life."</p>
