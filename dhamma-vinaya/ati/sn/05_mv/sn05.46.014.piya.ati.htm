					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living near Rājagaha, in the bamboo grove, in the Squirrels' feeding ground.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Venerable Maha Kassapa who was living in the Pipphali Cave, was afflicted with a disease, was suffering therefrom, and was gravely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One arising from his solitude at eventide visited the Venerable Maha Kassapa and sat down on a seat made ready (for him).</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus seated the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Maha Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well Kassapa, how is it with you?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are you bearing up, are you enduring (your suffering)?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do your pains decrease or increase?</p>

					<p class="f4">Are there signs of your pains decreasing and not of increasing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Ven. Sir, I am not bearing up, I am not enduring, the pain is very great.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a sign not of pains decreasing but of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kassapa, these seven factors of enlightenment are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization (of the four Noble Truths) and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">What are the seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">i. "Mindfulness, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">ii. "Investigation of the Dhamma, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">iii. "Persevering effort, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">iv. "Rapture, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">v. "Calm, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">vi. "Concentration, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">vii. "Equanimity, the factor of enlightenment, Kassapa, is well expounded by me, and is cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">It conduces to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These seven factors of enlightenment, Kassapa, are well expounded by me and are cultivated and fully developed by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">They conduce to perfect understanding, to full realization and to Nibbāna."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Most assuredly, O Blessed One, they are factor of enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="f4">Most assuredly, O Welcome Being (Sugata), they are factors of enlightenment."</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus said the Buddha, and the Venerable Maha Kassapa glad at heart approved the utterances of the Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thereupon the Venerable Kassapa recovered from that affliction, and that affliction, of the Venerable Kassapa disappeared.</p>
