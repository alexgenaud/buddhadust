					when developed and pursued,<br />
					are of great fruit and great benefit.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how are the four bases of power developed and pursued<br />
					so as to be of great fruit and great benefit?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where a monk<br />
					develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire and the fabrications of exertion,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This desire of mine<br />
					will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active,<br />
					neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps perceiving what is in front and behind<br />
					so that what is in front is the same as what is behind,<br />
					what is behind is the same as what is in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is below is the same as what is above,<br />
					what is above is the same as what is below.</p>

					<p class="f4">Night is the same as day,<br />
					day is the same as night.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of an awareness thus open and unhampered,<br />
					he develops a brightened mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on persistence...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on intent...</p>

					<p class="f4">"He develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on discrimination and the fabrications of exertion,<br />
					thinking,</p>

					<p class="f4">'This discrimination of mine<br />
					will be neither overly sluggish nor overly active,<br />
					neither inwardly restricted nor outwardly scattered.'</p>

					<p class="f4">He keeps perceiving what is in front and behind<br />
					so that what is in front is the same as what is behind,<br />
					what is behind is the same as what is in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">What is below is the same as what is above,<br />
					what is above is the same as what is below.</p>

					<p class="f4">[He dwells] by night as by day,<br />
					and by day as by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of an awareness thus open and unhampered,<br />
					he develops a brightened mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is desire overly sluggish?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever desire is accompanied by laziness,<br />
					conjoined with laziness,<br />
					that is called overly sluggish desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is desire overly active?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever desire is accompanied by restlessness,<br />
					conjoined with restlessness,<br />
					that is called overly active desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is desire inwardly restricted?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever desire is accompanied by sloth and drowsiness,<br />
					conjoined with sloth and drowsiness,<br />
					that is called inwardly restricted desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is desire outwardly scattered?</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever desire is stirred up by the five strings of sensuality,<br />
					outwardly dispersed and dissipated,<br />
					that is called outwardly scattered desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk dwell<br />
					perceiving what is in front and behind<br />
					so that what is in front is the same as what is behind,<br />
					and what is behind is the same as what is in front?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where a monk's perception of what is in front and behind<br />
					is well in hand,<br />
					well-attended to,<br />
					well-considered,<br />
					well-tuned ('penetrated') by means of discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk keeps perceiving what is in front and behind<br />
					so that what is in front is the same as what is behind,<br />
					and what is behind is the same as what is in front.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk dwell<br />
					so that what is below is the same as what is above,<br />
					and what is above is the same as what is below?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where a monk reflects on this very body,<br />
					from the soles of the feet on up,<br />
					from the crown of the head on down,<br />
					surrounded by skin,<br />
					and full of various kinds of unclean things:</p>

					<p class="f4">'In this body there are head hairs,<br />
					body hairs,<br />
					nails,<br />
					teeth,<br />
					skin,<br />
					flesh,<br />
					tendons,<br />
					bones,<br />
					bone marrow,<br />
					kidneys,<br />
					heart,<br />
					liver,<br />
					pleura,<br />
					spleen,<br />
					lungs,<br />
					large intestines,<br />
					small intestines,<br />
					gorge,<br />
					feces,<br />
					bile,<br />
					phlegm,<br />
					pus,<br />
					blood,<br />
					sweat,<br />
					fat,<br />
					tears,<br />
					skin-oil,<br />
					saliva,<br />
					mucus,<br />
					fluid in the joints,<br />
					urine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk dwells<br />
					so that what is below is the same as what is above,<br />
					and what is above is the same as what is below.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk dwell by night as by day,<br />
					and by day as by night?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where a monk at night<br />
					develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire and the fabrications of exertion<br />
					by means of the same modes (permutations) and signs and themes<br />
					that he uses by day,<br />
					and by day<br />
					he develops the base of power endowed with concentration founded on desire and the fabrications of exertion<br />
					by means of the same modes and signs and themes<br />
					that he uses by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk dwells by night as by day,<br />
					and by day as by night.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how does a monk<br />
					— by means of an awareness open and unhampered —<br />
					develop a brightened mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case<br />
					where a monk has the perception of light,<br />
					the perception of daytime <i>[at any hour of the day]</i><br />
					well in hand and well-established.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how a monk<br />
					— by means of an awareness open and unhampered —<br />
					develops a brightened mind.</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>(The above discussion is then repeated for persistence, intent, and discrimination.)</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"When a monk has thus developed and pursued the four bases of power, he experiences manifold supranormal powers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having been one he becomes many; having been many he becomes one.</p>

					<p class="f4">He appears.</p>

					<p class="f4">He vanishes.</p>

					<p class="f4">He goes unimpeded through walls,<br />
					ramparts,<br />
					and mountains as if through space.</p>

					<p class="f4">He dives in and out of the earth<br />
					as if it were water.</p>

					<p class="f4">He walks on water without sinking<br />
					as if it were dry land.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sitting cross-legged<br />
					he flies through the air<br />
					like a winged bird.</p>

					<p class="f4">With his hand he touches and strokes<br />
					even the sun and moon,<br />
					so mighty and powerful.</p>

					<p class="f4">He exercises influence with his body<br />
					even as far as the Brahma worlds.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He hears<br />
					— by means of the divine ear-element,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					both kinds of sounds:<br />
					divine and human,<br />
					whether near or far.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He knows the awareness of other beings,<br />
					other individuals,<br />
					having encompassed it with his own awareness.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with passion as a mind with passion,<br />
					and a mind without passion as a mind without passion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with aversion as a mind with aversion,<br />
					and a mind without aversion as a mind without aversion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a mind with delusion as a mind with delusion,<br />
					and a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a restricted mind as a restricted mind,<br />
					and a scattered mind as a scattered mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns an enlarged mind as an enlarged mind,<br />
					and an unenlarged mind as an unenlarged mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns an excelled mind<br />
					<i>[one that is not at the most excellent level]</i><br />
					as an excelled mind,<br />
					and an unexcelled mind as an unexcelled mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a concentrated mind as a concentrated mind,<br />
					and an unconcentrated mind as an unconcentrated mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">He discerns a released mind as a released mind,<br />
					and an unreleased mind as an unreleased mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He recollects his manifold past lives <i>(lit: previous homes),</i> i.e.,<br />
					one birth,<br />
					two births,<br />
					three births,<br />
					four, five, ten,<br />
					twenty, thirty, forty, fifty,<br />
					one hundred,<br />
					one thousand,<br />
					one hundred thousand,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic contraction,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic expansion,<br />
					many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion,<br />
					<i>[recollecting],</i> 'There I had such a name,<br />
					belonged to such a clan,<br />
					had such an appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					such the end of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />
					I re-arose there.</p>

					<p class="f4">There too I had such a name,<br />
					belonged to such a clan,<br />
					had such an appearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such was my food,<br />
					such my experience of pleasure and pain,<br />
					such the end of my life.</p>

					<p class="f4">Passing away from that state,<br />
					I re-arose here.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus he remembers his manifold past lives<br />
					in their modes and details.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He sees<br />
					— by means of the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are<br />
					inferior and superior,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These beings<br />
					— who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who reviled the noble ones,<br />
					held wrong views<br />
					and undertook actions<br />
					under the influence of wrong views —<br />
					with the break-up of the body,<br />
					after death,<br />
					have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation,<br />
					the bad destination,<br />
					the lower realms,<br />
					in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">But these beings<br />
					— who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, and mind,<br />
					who did not revile the noble ones,<br />
					who held right views<br />
					and undertook actions<br />
					under the influence of right views —<br />
					with the break-up of the body,<br />
					after death,<br />
					have re-appeared in the good destinations,<br />
					in the heavenly world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus — by means of the divine eye,<br />
					purified and surpassing the human —<br />
					he sees beings passing away and re-appearing,<br />
					and he discerns how they are<br />
					inferior and superior,<br />
					beautiful and ugly,<br />
					fortunate and unfortunate<br />
					in accordance with their kamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Through the ending of the mental effluents,<br />
					he remains in the effluent-free awareness-release<br />
					and discernment-release,<br />
					having known and made them manifest for himself<br />
					right in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how these four bases of power,<br />
					when developed and pursued,<br />
					are of great fruit and great benefit."</p>
