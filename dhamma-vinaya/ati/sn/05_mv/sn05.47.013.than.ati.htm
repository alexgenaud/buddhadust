Now at that time <a id="sariputta">Ven. Sāriputta</a> was staying among the <a id="magadhans">Magadhans</a> in <a id="nalaka">Nalaka</a> village — diseased, in pain, severely ill. <a id="Cunda">Cunda</a> the novice was his attendant. Then, because of that illness, <a id="dies">Ven. Sāriputta</a> attained total Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Cunda the novice, taking Ven. Sāriputta's bowl and robes, went to <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a> in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery, near Sāvatthi, and on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Ānanda: "Venerable sir, Ven. Sāriputta has attained total Unbinding. Here are his bowl and robes."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Cunda, my friend, this news is reason for seeing the Blessed One. Come, let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, venerable sir," Cunda the novice replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">So Ven. Ānanda and Cunda the novice went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side. As they were sitting there, Ven. Ānanda said to him, "Lord, just now Cunda the novice said to me, 'Venerable sir, Ven. Sāriputta has attained total Unbinding. Here are his bowl and robes.' It was as if my body were drugged, I lost my bearings, things weren't clear to me, on hearing that Ven. Sāriputta had attained total Unbinding."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Ānanda, when he attained total Unbinding, did Sāriputta take the aggregate of virtue along with him? Did he take the aggregate of concentration... discernment... release... the aggregate of knowledge and vision of release along with him?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, lord, when he attained total Unbinding, Ven. Sāriputta didn't take the aggregate of virtue... concentration... discernment... release... the aggregate of knowledge and vision of release along with him. It's just that he was my instructor and counselor, one who exhorted, urged, roused, and encouraged me. He was tireless in teaching the Dhamma, a help to his companions in the holy life. We miss the nourishment of his Dhamma, the wealth of his Dhamma, his help in the Dhamma."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But, Ānanda, haven't I already taught you the state of growing different with regard to all things dear and appealing, the state of becoming separate, the state of becoming otherwise? What else is there to expect? It's impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, and subject to disintegration from disintegrating.</p>

					<p class="f4">"<a id="limb">Just as</a> if the largest limb were to fall off of a great tree composed of heartwood, standing firm; in the same way, Sāriputta has attained total Unbinding from this great community of monks composed of heartwood, standing firm. What else is there to expect? It's impossible that one could forbid anything born, existent, fabricated, and subject to disintegration from disintegrating.</p>
					<p class="f4">"Therefore, Ānanda, each of you should remain with your self as an <a id="island">island</a>, your self as your refuge, without anything else as a refuge. Remain with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as your refuge, without anything else as a refuge. And how does a monk remain with his self as an island, his self as his refuge, without anything else as a refuge? How does he remain with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as his refuge, without anything else as a refuge? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings... mind... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. This is how a monk remains with his self as an island, his self as his refuge, without anything else as a refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as his refuge, without anything else as a refuge. For those who — now or after I am gone — remain with their self as an island, their self as their refuge, without anything else as a refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, the Dhamma as their refuge, without anything else as a refuge, they will be the highest of the monks who desire training."</p>
