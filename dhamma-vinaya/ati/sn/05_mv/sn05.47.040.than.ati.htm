					<p class="f4">"Now, <a id="frames">what are the frames</a> of reference? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world. He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves... mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the development of the frames of reference? There is the case where a monk remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the body — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to feelings, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to feelings, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to feelings — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"He remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the mind, remains focused on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the mind, remains focused on the phenomenon of origination and passing away with regard to the mind — ardent, alert, and mindful — putting aside greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>
