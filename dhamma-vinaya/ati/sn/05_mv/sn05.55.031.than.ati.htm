					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Awakened One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in clear-knowing and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the cosmos, unexcelled trainer of people fit to be tamed, teacher of devas and human beings, awakened, blessed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the first bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Dhamma:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be experienced by the observant for themselves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the second bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with verified confidence in the Saṇgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well... who have practiced straight-forwardly... who have practiced methodically... who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types — they are the Saṇgha of the Blessed One's disciples: deserving of gifts, deserving of hospitality, deserving of offerings, deserving of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the third bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the observant, ungrasped at, leading to concentration.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the fourth bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, nourishments of bliss."</p>
