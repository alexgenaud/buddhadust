Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case where the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Awakened One: 'Indeed, the Blessed One is worthy and rightly self-awakened, consummate in knowledge and conduct, well-gone, an expert with regard to the world, unexcelled as a trainer for those people fit to be tamed, the Teacher of divine and human beings, awakened, blessed.' This is the first bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Dhamma: 'The Dhamma is well-expounded by the Blessed One, to be seen here and now, timeless, inviting verification, pertinent, to be realized by the wise for themselves.' This is the second bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with unwavering confidence in the Saŋgha: 'The Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples who have practiced well...who have practiced straight-forwardly...who have practiced methodically...who have practiced masterfully — in other words, the four types of noble disciples when taken as pairs, the eight when taken as individual types -- they are the Saŋgha of the Blessed One's disciples: worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of respect, the incomparable field of merit for the world.' This is the third bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And further, the disciple of the noble ones is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration. This is the fourth bonanza of merit, bonanza of skillfulness, nourishment of bliss.</p>

					<p class="f4">"These are four bonanzas of merit, bonanzas of skillfulness, nourishments of bliss."</p>
