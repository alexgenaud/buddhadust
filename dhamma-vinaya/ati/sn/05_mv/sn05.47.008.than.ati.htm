The Buddha explains that in the same way as an incompetant cook who does not note the needs and responses of those he cooks for gets no gains, fame or favors, in the same way the bhikkhu who does not live developing the four settings-up of the memory gets no advancement in this Dhamma and Discipline." />

					<p class="f4">Because the foolish, incompetent, unskillful monk doesn't take note of his own mind.</p>
