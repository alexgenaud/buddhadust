					<p><i>Although the Buddha had many lay disciples who were non-returners and so had mastered the <i>jhānas</i> — see, for example, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/dn/idx_digha_nikaya.htm#p16">DN 16</a>, <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_07_sattakanipata.htm#p50">AN 7:50</a>, and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_08_atthakanipata.htm#p22">AN 8:22</a> — there are very few discourses depicting how lay people were taught advanced meditation techniques. This discourse is one of the few.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"And by the following sequence it may also be known how a Tathāgata's dwelling is one thing, and the dwelling of one in training is something else.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"There was one time, friend Mahānāma when the Blessed One was staying in Icchānaṇgala in the Icchānaṇgala forest grove.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Monks, I wish to go into seclusion for three months.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I am not to be approached by anyone at all except for the one who brings almsfood.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"'As you say, lord,' the monks responded to him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And no one approached the Blessed One except for the one who brought almsfood.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Then the Blessed One, having emerged from seclusion after the passing of three months, addressed the monks:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Monks, if wanderers of other sects ask you,</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"By means of what dwelling, friends, did Gotama the contemplative mostly dwell during the rains residence?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">You, thus asked, should answer them in this way:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Following the Thai edition. The other editions call him Ven. Lomavaṇgīsa, and title the sutta, Kaṇkheyya, "Perplexity."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> This word can be an epithet specifically of the Buddha or of any arahant. As the following discussion shows, it has the second meaning here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Whereas, in the normal formula for breath meditation, the meditator is described as "always mindful <i>(sato'va),"</i> the Buddha simply describes himself as mindful. This, apparently, is a reference to the fact that he is already always mindful, so he doesn't have to emphasize the point.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Whereas, in the normal formula for breath meditation, the verb in this step and the remaining ones is "he trains himself <i>(sikkhati),"</i> when the Buddha talks of his own practice, he simply says, "I discern <i>(pajānāmi)."</i> He has no further need to train.</p>
