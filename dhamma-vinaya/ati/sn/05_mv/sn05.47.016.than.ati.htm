					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Uttiya went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "It would be good, lord, if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, Uttiya, purify the very basis with regard to skillful qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the basis of skillful qualities?</p>

					<p class="f4">Well-purified virtue and views made straight.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, when your virtue is well purified and your views made straight, in dependence on virtue, established in virtue, you should develop the four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself—ardent, alert, and mindful—subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves...</p>

					<p class="f4">mind in and of itself...</p>

					<p class="f4">mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, in dependence on virtue, established in virtue, you develop these four establishings of mindfulness in this way, you will go beyond Māra’s realm."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Uttiya, delighting in and approving of the Blessed One’s words, got up from his seat, bowed down to the Blessed One, circled around him, keeping the Blessed One to his right side, and left.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, dwelling alone, secluded, heedful, ardent, and resolute, he in no long time entered and remained in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, directly knowing and realizing it for himself in the here and now.</p>

					<p class="f4">He knew:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is nothing further for the sake of this world."</p>

					<p class="f4">And thus Ven. Uttiya became another one of the arahants.</p>
