<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya, V: Maha Vagga 48: Indriya Samyuttam: Sutta 44. In a lesson clearly directed at teaching the bhikkhus the distinction between faith and knowledge, the Buddha questions Sāriputta as to whether or not he believes that the five forces lead to Nibbāna. Sāriputta states that he does not go by faith in this matter but by has realized it for himself." />

					<p class="f4">There he addressed Ven. Sāriputta:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Sāriputta, do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation?</p>

					<p class="f4">Do you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Lord, it’s not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation.</p>

					<p class="f4">And as for me, I have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment.</p>

					<p class="f4">I have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, Sāriputta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, gains a footing in the deathless, has the deathless as its final end and consummation."</p>
