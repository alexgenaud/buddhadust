Anuruddha and Ven. Sāriputta were staying near Vesālī in Ambapālīs forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, arising from his seclusion in the late afternoon, went to Ven. Anuruddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Anuruddha, "Bright are your faculties, friend Anuruddha; pure your complexion, and clear.</p>

					<p class="f4">By means of what dwelling do you now often dwell?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"I now often dwell, friend, with a mind well-established in the four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where I remain focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">I remain focused on feelings in and of themselves... the mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"I now often dwell, friend, with a mind well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Any monk whose effluents are ended — who has reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, laid to waste the fetter of becoming, and who is released through right gnosis — often dwells with a mind well-established in these four establishings of mindfulness."</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is a gain for us, my friend, a great gain for us, that we were right in Ven. Anuruddha’s presence when he said this bull-like statement!"</p>
