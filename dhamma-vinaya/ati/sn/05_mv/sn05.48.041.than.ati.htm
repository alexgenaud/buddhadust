Now on that occasion the Blessed One, on emerging from seclusion in the late afternoon, sat warming his back in the western sun. Then <a id="ananda">Ven. Ānanda</a> went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to the Blessed One, massaged the Blessed One's limbs with his hand and said, "<a id="Buddha">It's amazing</a>, lord. It's astounding, how the Blessed One's complexion is no longer so clear and bright; his limbs are flabby and wrinkled; his back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in his faculties — the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That's the way it is, Ānanda. When young, one is subject to aging; when healthy, subject to illness; when alive, subject to death. The complexion is no longer so clear and bright; the limbs are flabby and wrinkled; the back, bent forward; there's a discernible change in the faculties — the faculty of the eye, the faculty of the ear, the faculty of the nose, the faculty of the tongue, the faculty of the body."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>

					<p class="f4 in2"><a id="spit">I spit</a> on you, old age — <br />
					old age that makes for ugliness.<br />
					The bodily image, so charming,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is trampled by old age.<br />
					Even those who live to a hundred<br />
					are headed — all — to an end in death,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which spares no one,<br />
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which tramples all.</p>
