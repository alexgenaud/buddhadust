							<p class="f2">This is a matter of orientation. For me the term "Awakening" is here 'the process of awakening,' not the accomplished state, and has various dimensions. Even so, what is Ven. Sāriputta, an arahant, an awakened being, doing if not inhabiting dimensions of the awakened state?</p>

					<p><i>This sutta and the following one make the point that the factors for awakening are not factors </i>of<i> awakening. In other words, they lead to the experience of awakening, but they do not constitute the features of the awakened state. In this sutta, Ven. Sāriputta, an arahant, notes that he can observe the factors for awakening arising and passing away within him. If they were features of the awakened state, they would not pass away, as the awakened state is deathless. In the next sutta, the Buddha clearly states that the factors for awakening — or, in the Pali formulation, awakening-factors — are called that because they </i>lead<i> to awakening. Nowhere does he say that they constitute the features of the awakened state.</i></p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Friend monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, friend," the monks responded to him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Sāriputta said, "Friends, there are these seven factors for awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">Mindfulness as a factor for awakening, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, concentration as a factor for awakening, and equanimity as a factor for awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the seven factors for awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Whichever factor for awakening among these seven factors for awakening I want to dwell in during the morning, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the middle of the day, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the middle of the day.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the late afternoon, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the late afternoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">"If the thought occurs to me, 'mindfulness as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>[Similarly with analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, persistence as a factor for awakening, rapture as a factor for awakening, calm as a factor for awakening, and concentration as a factor for awakening.]</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"If the thought occurs to me, 'equanimity as a factor for awakening,' the thought occurs to me, 'It is immeasurable'; the thought occurs to me, 'It is well-mastered.'</p>

					<p class="f4">While it remains, I discern, 'It remains.'</p>

					<p class="f4">If it falls away from me, I discern, 'It has fallen away from me because of this condition.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose, friends, that a king or king's minister had a wardrobe full of many-colored clothes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whichever set of clothes he might want to wear during the morning, he would wear that set of clothes during the morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whichever set of clothes he might want to wear during the late afternoon, he would wear that set of clothes during the late afternoon.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, whichever factor for awakening among these seven factors for awakening I want to dwell in during the morning, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the morning.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whichever factor for awakening I want to dwell in during the middle of the day, I dwell in that factor for awakening during the middle of the day.</p>
