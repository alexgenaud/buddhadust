					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Ven. Mahā Kassapa was staying in the Pepper Tree Cave: diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to Ven. Mahā Kassapa and, on arrival, sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having sat down, he said to Ven. Mahā Kassapa, "I hope you are getting better, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not getting better, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kassapa, these seven factors for awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, lead to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindfulness as a factor for awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Persistence as a factor for awakening....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rapture as a factor for awakening....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Calm as a factor for awakening....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Concentration as a factor for awakening....</p>

					<p class="f4">"Equanimity as a factor for awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kassapa, these are the seven factors for awakening rightly taught by me that—when developed and pursued—lead to direct knowledge, to self-awakening, to unbinding."</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are indeed factors for awakening, O Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are indeed factors for awakening, O One Well-Gone."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, Ven. Mahā Kassapa delighted in the Blessed One’s words.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Ven. Mahā Kassapa recovered from his disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was how Ven. Mahā Kassapa’s disease was abandoned.</p>
