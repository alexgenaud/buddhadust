					<p class="f4">And on that occasion <a id="kassapa">Ven. Maha Kassapa</a> was staying in the Pepper Tree Cave, diseased, in pain, severely ill.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, in the late afternoon, left his seclusion and went to where Ven. Maha Kassapa was staying.</p>

					<p class="f4">On arrival, he sat down on a prepared seat and said to Ven. Maha Kassapa,</p>

					<p class="f4">"I hope you are getting better, Kassapa.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope you are comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that your pains are lessening and not increasing.</p>

					<p class="f4">I hope that there are signs of their lessening, and not of their increasing."</p>

					<p class="f4">"I am not getting better, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">I am not comfortable.</p>

					<p class="f4">My extreme pains are increasing, not lessening.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are signs of their increasing, and not of their lessening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kassapa, <a id="p7fac">these seven</a> factors for Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, lead to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which seven?</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mindfulness as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Analysis of qualities as a factor for Awakening, rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Persistence as a factor for Awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Rapture as a factor for Awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Serenity as a factor for Awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Concentration as a factor for Awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">"Equanimity as a factor for Awakening rightly taught by me, when developed and pursued, leads to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Kassapa, these are the seven factors for Awakening rightly taught by me that — when developed and pursued — lead to direct knowledge, to self-Awakening, to Unbinding."</p>

					<p class="f4">"They are indeed factors for Awakening, O Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">They are indeed factors for Awakening, O One Well-Gone."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, Ven. Maha Kassapa delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Ven. Maha Kassapa recovered from his disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">That was how Ven. Maha Kassapa's disease was abandoned.</p>
