					<h4>Translator's Note:</h4>
					
					<p>In the detailed descriptions of how the seven factors for awakening develop, the mindfulness factor is usually associated with the practice of the four establishings of mindfulness. This discourse is interesting in that it equates mindfulness as a factor for awakening with the recollection of the Dhamma that one has heard from awakened monks. On pondering and analyzing that Dhamma (the second factor), one is inspired to follow it, abandoning unskillful qualities and developing skillful qualities (the third factor). In this way, the mind is brought to concentration, which can then act as a basis for further discernment. This would count as a case in which insight precedes tranquility (see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_04_catukkanipata.htm#p170">AN 4:170</a>).</p>

					<p class="f4">When a monk, remaining secluded in this way, recollects and thinks over that Dhamma, <i>mindfulness</i> as a factor for awakening is aroused in him.</p>
