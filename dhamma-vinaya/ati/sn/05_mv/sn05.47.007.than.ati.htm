					<p class="f4">There are difficult, uneven areas where monkeys wander, but not human beings.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are level stretches of land, delightful, where both monkeys and human beings wander.</p>

					<p class="f4">In such spots hunters set a tar trap in the monkeys' tracks, in order to catch some monkeys.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those monkeys who are not foolish or careless by nature, when they see the tar trap, will keep their distance.</p>

					<p class="f4">But any monkey who is foolish and careless by nature comes up to the tar trap and grabs it with its paw, which then gets stuck there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I'll free my paw,' he grabs it with his other paw.</p>

					<p class="f4">That too gets stuck.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I'll free both of my paws,' he grabs it with his foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">That too gets stuck. Thinking, 'I'll free both of my paws and my foot,' he grabs it with his other foot.</p>

					<p class="f4">That too gets stuck.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thinking, 'I'll free both of my paws and my feet as well,' he grabs it with his mouth.</p>

					<p class="f4">That too gets stuck.</p>

					<p class="f4">So the monkey, snared in five ways, lies there whimpering, having fallen on misfortune, fallen on ruin, a prey to whatever the hunter wants to do with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the hunter, without releasing the monkey, skewers him right there, picks him up, and goes off as he likes.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is what happens to anyone who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"For this reason, you should not wander into what is not your proper range and is the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who wanders into what is not his proper range and is the territory of others, Māra gains an opening, Māra gains a foothold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, for a monk, is not his proper range and is the territory of others?</p>

					<p class="f4">The five strings of sensuality.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">Forms cognizable by the eye — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sounds cognizable by the ear...</p>

					<p class="f4">Aromas cognizable by the nose...</p>

					<p class="f4">Flavors cognizable by the tongue...</p>

					<p class="f4">Tactile sensations cognizable by the body — agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, enticing, linked to sensual desire.</p>

					<p class="f4">These, for a monk, are not his proper range and are the territory of others.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Wander, monks, in what is your proper range, your own ancestral territory.</p>

					<p class="f4">In one who wanders in what is his proper range, his own ancestral territory, Māra gains no opening, Māra gains no foothold.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral territory?</p>

					<p class="f4">The four establishings of mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk remains focused on the body in and of itself — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">He remains focused on feelings in and of themselves... mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — ardent, alert, and mindful — subduing greed and distress with reference to the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, for a monk, is his proper range, his own ancestral territory."</p>
