					<p class="f4">Then, having left his seclusion in the late afternoon, Ven. Sāriputta went to Ven. Upavāṇa and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Upavāṇa, "Friend Upavāṇa, would a monk know for himself that 'Through appropriate attention, the seven factors for awakening, mastered in me in such a way, lead to a pleasant abiding'?"</p>

					my persistence is aroused;<br />
					I attend (to it) in a focused way, not sluggishly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">"When arousing analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">persistence as a factor for awakening... rapture as a factor for awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">calm as a factor for awakening...</p>

					<p class="f4">concentration as a factor for awakening...</p>
