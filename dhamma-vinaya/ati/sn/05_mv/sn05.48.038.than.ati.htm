The Buddha gives detailed definitions of each of the five forces (that of pleasure, that of pain, that of mental ease, that of mental discomfort and that of detachment). He then shows how each of these forces are to be regarded as sense-experiences." />

					<p class="f4">Which five?</p>

					<p class="f4">The pleasure-faculty, the pain-faculty, the happiness-faculty, the distress-faculty, the equanimity-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the pleasure-faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Any physical pleasure, physical comfort born of body-contact to be experienced as pleasure and comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the pleasure-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the pain-faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Any physical pain, physical discomfort born of body-contact to be experienced as pain and discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the pain-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the happiness-faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Any mental pleasure, mental comfort born of intellect-contact to be experienced as pleasure and comfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the happiness -faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the distress-faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Any mental pain, mental discomfort born of intellect-contact to be experienced as pain and discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the distress-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the equanimity-faculty?</p>

					<p class="f4">Anything, physical or mental, to be experienced as neither comfort nor discomfort.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is called the equanimity-faculty.</p>

					<p class="f4">"With regard to this, the pleasure-faculty and happiness-faculty are to be seen as a feeling of pleasure.</p>

					<p class="f4">The pain-faculty and distress-faculty are to be seen as a feeling of pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">The equanimity-faculty is to be seen as a feeling of neither pleasure nor pain.</p>
