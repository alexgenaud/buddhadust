					<p class="f4">Then Mahānāma the Sakyan went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One, "Lord, this Kapilavatthu is rich and prosperous, populous and crowded, its alleys congested.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sometimes, when I enter Kapilavatthu in the evening after visiting with the Blessed One or with the monks who inspire the mind, I meet up with a runaway elephant, a runaway horse, a runaway chariot, a runaway cart, or a runaway person.</p>

					<p class="f4">At times like that my mindfulness with regard to the Blessed One gets muddled, my mindfulness with regard to the Dhamma...</p>

					<p class="f4">the Saṅgha gets muddled.</p>

					<p class="f4">The thought occurs to me, 'If I were to die at this moment, what would be my destination?</p>

					<p class="f4">What would be my future course?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have no fear, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have no fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your death will not be a bad one, your demise will not be bad.</p>

					<p class="f4">If one's mind has long been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with relinquishment, nurtured with discernment, then when the body — endowed with form, composed of the four primary elements, born from mother and father, nourished with rice and porridge, subject to inconstancy, rubbing, pressing, dissolution, and dispersion — is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind — long nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, learning, relinquishment, and discernment — rises upward and separates out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose a man were to throw a jar of ghee or a jar of oil into a deep lake of water, where it would break.</p>

					<p class="f4">There the shards and jar-fragments would go down, while the ghee or oil would rise upward and separate out.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the same way, if one's mind has long been nurtured with conviction, nurtured with virtue, nurtured with learning, nurtured with relinquishment, nurtured with discernment, then when the body...</p>

					<p class="f4">is eaten by crows, vultures, hawks, dogs, hyenas, or all sorts of creatures, nevertheless the mind...</p>

					<p class="f4">rises upward and separates out.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have no fear, Mahānāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Have no fear.</p>

					<p class="f4">Your death will not be a bad one, your demise will not be bad."</p>
