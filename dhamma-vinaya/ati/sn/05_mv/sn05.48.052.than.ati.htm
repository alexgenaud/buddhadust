					<p class="f4">Now, there is a town of the Mallans named Uruvelakappa, and there the Blessed One addressed the monks:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, as long as noble knowledge has not arisen in a disciple of the noble ones, four faculties are not stable, four faculties are not firm; but when noble knowledge has arisen in a disciple of the noble ones, four faculties are stable, four faculties are firm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Just as—as long as the ridge-beam of a house with a ridged roof, is not in place — the rafters are not stable, the rafters are not firm, but when the ridge-beam of the house with a ridged roof is in place, the rafters are stable, the rafters are firm; in the same way, as long as noble knowledge has not arisen in a disciple of the noble ones, four faculties are not stable, four faculties are not firm; but when noble knowledge has arisen in a disciple of the noble ones, four faculties are stable, four faculties are firm.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The faculty of conviction,<br />
					the faculty of persistence,<br />
					the faculty of mindfulness,<br />
					and the faculty of concentration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When a disciple of the noble ones is discerning, the conviction that follows from that is stable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The persistence that follows from that is stable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The mindfulness that follows from that is stable.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The concentration that follows from that is stable."</p>
