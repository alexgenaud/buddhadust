					<p class="f4">They remain focused on feelings in and of themselves... the mind in and of itself... mental qualities in and of themselves — being ardent, alert, unified, clear-minded, concentrated, and single-minded for comprehension of mental qualities.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Monks, even those who are arahants — whose effluents are ended, who have reached fulfillment, done the task, laid down the burden, attained the true goal, totally destroyed the fetter of becoming, and who are released through right gnosis — even they remain focused on the body in and of itself — being ardent, alert, unified, clear-minded, concentrated, and single-minded, disjoined from the body.</p>
