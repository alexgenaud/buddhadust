					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said, "Monks, do you develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing?"</p>

					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Ariṭṭha replied to the Blessed One, <i>"I</i> develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"But how do you develop mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, Ariṭṭha?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Having abandoned sensual desire for past sensual pleasures, lord, having done away with sensual desire for future sensual pleasures, and having thoroughly subdued perceptions of resistance with regard to internal &amp; external events, I breathe in mindfully and breathe out mindfully."<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"There is that mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing, Ariṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4">I don't say that there isn't.</p>

					<p class="f4">But as to how mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing is brought in detail to its culmination, listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," Ven. Ariṭṭha responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "And how, Ariṭṭha, is mindfulness of in-&amp;-out breathing brought in detail to its culmination?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building, sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect, and establishing mindfulness to the fore.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The Commentary reads this statement as indicating that Ariṭṭha has attained the third level of awakening, non-return, but it is also possible to interpret the statement on a more mundane level: Ariṭṭha is simply practicing mindful equanimity — in the present moment, having temporarily subdued desire for past and future sensual pleasures, and having temporarily subdued any thought of resistance with regard to the present.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> To the fore <i>(parimukhaṁ):</i> The Abhidhamma takes an etymological approach to this term, defining it as around <i>(pari-)</i> the mouth<i> (mukhaṁ).</i> In the Vinaya, however, it is used in a context <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/sbe/vp/03.cv/vp.03.cv.05.rdho.sbe.htm#fn233">(Cv.V.27.4)</a> where it undoubtedly means the front of the chest.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There is also the possibility that the term could be used idiomatically as "to the front," which is how I have translated it here.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p>"Body means the breath". What this means is that what body is at it's most fundamental is the breath. The body, as we understand it as humans is an illusion which eminates from the breath. It is the same for 'perception' 'experience', 'own-making' and 'consciousness'. The next term should be read as: 'breath is fabrication of body'.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> The commentaries insist that "body" here means the breath, but this is unlikely in this context, for the next step — without further explanation — refers to the breath as "bodily fabrication." If the Buddha were using two different terms to refer to the breath in such close proximity, he would have been careful to signal that he was redefining his terms (as he does in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p118">MN 118,</a> and <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/05_mv/idx_54_anapanasamyutta.htm#p13">SN 54:13</a>, when explaining that the first four steps in breath meditation correspond to the practice of focusing on the body in &amp; of itself as a frame of reference).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The step of breathing in and out sensitive to the entire body relates to the many similes in the suttas depicting jhāna as a state of whole-body awareness (see <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p119">MN 119</a>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> "In-&amp;-out breaths are bodily; these are things tied up with the body.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">That's why in-&amp;-out breaths are bodily fabrications." <i> — <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">MN 44</a></i></p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"And how is a monk calmed in his bodily fabrication? There is the case where a monk, with the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain — as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress — enters &amp; remains in the fourth jhāna: purity of equanimity &amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain." <i> — <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_10_dasakanipata.htm#p20">AN 10:20</a></i></p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">"When one has attained the fourth jhāna, in-and-out breaths have ceased." <i> — <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/04_salv/idx_36_vedanasamyutta.htm#p11">SN 36:11</a></i> &amp; <i><a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p31">AN 9:31</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> "Perceptions &amp; feelings are mental; these are things tied up with the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's why perceptions &amp; feelings are mental fabrications." <i> — <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p44">MN 44</a></i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/an/idx_09_navakanipata.htm#p34">AN 9:34</a> shows how the mind, step by step, is temporarily released from burdensome mental states of greater and greater refinement as it advances through the stages of jhāna.</p>
