					<p class="f4">Then a certain brahman went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"What now, Master Gotama: Is the one who acts the same one who experiences (the results of the act)?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[The Buddha:] "(To say,) ‘The one who acts is the same one who experiences,’ is one extreme."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[The brahman:] "Then, Master Gotama, is the one who acts someone other than the one who experiences?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[The Buddha:] "(To say,) ‘The one who acts is someone other than the one who experiences,’ is the second extreme.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Avoiding both of these extremes, the Tathāgata teaches the Dhamma via the middle:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease. Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this was said, the brahman said to the Blessed One:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent!</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama—through many lines of reasoning—made the Dhamma clear.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of monks.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life."</p>
