					<p class="f4">"When a fool is obstructed by ignorance and conjoined with craving, this body thus results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there is both this body and external name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, in dependence on this duality, there is contact at the six senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these, or one or another of them, the fool is sensitive to pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"When a wise person is obstructed by ignorance and conjoined with craving, this body thus results.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now there is both this body and external name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">Here, in dependence on this duality, there is contact at the six senses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Touched by these, or one or another of them, the wise person is sensitive to pleasure and pain.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So what difference, what distinction, what distinguishing factor is there between the wise person and the fool?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"For us, lord, the teachings have the Blessed One as their root, their guide, and their arbitrator.</p>

					<p class="f4">It would be good if the Blessed One himself would explicate the meaning of this statement.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having heard it from the Blessed One, the monks will remember it."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In that case, monks, listen and pay close attention. I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "The ignorance with which the fool is obstructed, the craving with which he is conjoined, through which this body results: That ignorance has not been abandoned by the fool; that craving has not been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">The fool has not practiced the holy life for the right ending of stress.</p>

					<p class="f4">Therefore, at the break-up of the body, he is headed for a (new) body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Headed for a body, he is not entirely freed from birth, aging, death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair.</p>

					<p class="f4">I tell you, he is not entirely freed from stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The ignorance with which the wise person is obstructed, the craving with which he is conjoined, through which this body results: That ignorance has been abandoned by the wise person; that craving has been destroyed.</p>
