					<p class="f4">Listen and pay close attention.</p>

					<p class="f4">I will speak."</p>

					<p class="f4">"As you say, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the origination of the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the eye and forms there arises eye-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the origination of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Dependent on the ear and sounds there arises ear-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact....</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the nose and aromas there arises nose-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact....</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the tongue and flavors there arises tongue-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact....</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the body and tactile sensations there arises body-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact....</p>

					<p class="f4">Dependent on the intellect and mental qualities there arises intellect-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the origination of the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is the ending of the world?</p>

					<p class="f4">The meeting of the three is contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, from the remainderless cessation and fading away of that very craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is the ending of the world.</p>
