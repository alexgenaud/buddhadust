					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p class="f4"><i>This discourse describes the link between fabrications and consciousness in dependent co-arising, and shows how intention and underlying obsessions — with ignorance of the four noble truths being the basis for all obsessions — play a role in constituting awareness of the present moment.</i></p>
