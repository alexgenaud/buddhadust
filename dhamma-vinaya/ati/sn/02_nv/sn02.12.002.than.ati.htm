					<p class="f4">"Monks, I will describe and analyze dependent co-arising for you.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And what is dependent co-arising?</p>

					<p class="f4">From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">From name-and-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From birth as a requisite condition,<br />
					then aging and death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					distress,<br />
					and despair come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Now which <i>aging and death?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever aging,<br />
					decrepitude,<br />
					brokenness,<br />
					graying,<br />
					wrinkling,<br />
					decline of life-force,<br />
					weakening of the faculties<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called aging.</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever deceasing,<br />
					passing away,<br />
					breaking up,<br />
					disappearance,<br />
					dying,<br />
					death,<br />
					completion of time,<br />
					break up of the aggregates,<br />
					casting off of the body,<br />
					interruption in the life faculty<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called death.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>birth?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever birth,<br />
					taking birth,<br />
					descent,<br />
					coming-to-be,<br />
					coming-forth,<br />
					appearance of aggregates,<br />
					and acquisition of [sense] media<br />
					of the various beings<br />
					in this or that group of beings,<br />
					that is called birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>becoming?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These three are becomings:<br />
					sensual becoming,<br />
					form becoming,<br />
					and formless becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>clinging/sustenance?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These four are clingings:<br />
					sensuality clinging,<br />
					view clinging,<br />
					precept and practice clinging,<br />
					and doctrine of self clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called clinging.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>craving?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These six are classes of craving:<br />
					craving for forms,<br />
					craving for sounds,<br />
					craving for smells,<br />
					craving for tastes,<br />
					craving for tactile sensations,<br />
					craving for ideas.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>feeling?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These six are classes of feeling:<br />
					feeling born from eye-contact,<br />
					feeling born from ear-contact,<br />
					feeling born from nose-contact,<br />
					feeling born from tongue-contact,<br />
					feeling born from body-contact,<br />
					feeling born from intellect-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>contact?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These six are classes of contact:<br />
					eye-contact,<br />
					ear-contact,<br />
					nose-contact,<br />
					tongue-contact,<br />
					body-contact,<br />
					intellect-contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>the six sense media?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These six are sense media:<br />
					the eye-medium,<br />
					the ear-medium,<br />
					the nose-medium,<br />
					the tongue-medium,<br />
					the body-medium,<br />
					the intellect-medium.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called the six sense media.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>name-and-form?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Feeling,<br />
					perception,<br />
					intention,<br />
					contact,<br />
					and attention:<br />
					This is called name.</p>

					<p class="f4">The four great elements,<br />
					and the form dependent on the four great elements:<br />
					This is called form.</p>

					<p class="f4">This name and this form are called name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>consciousness?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These six are classes of consciousness:<br />
					eye-consciousness,<br />
					ear-consciousness,<br />
					nose-consciousness,<br />
					tongue-consciousness,<br />
					body-consciousness,<br />
					intellect-consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is called consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>fabrications?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">These three are fabrications:<br />
					bodily fabrications,<br />
					verbal fabrications,<br />
					mental fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are called fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And which <i>ignorance?</i></p>

					<p class="f4">Not knowing stress,<br />
					not knowing the origination of stress,<br />
					not knowing the cessation of stress,<br />
					not knowing the way of practice leading to the cessation of stress:<br />
					This is called ignorance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now from the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth,<br />
					then aging and death,<br />
					sorrow,<br />
					lamentation,<br />
					pain,<br />
					distress,<br />
					and despair all cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering."</p>
