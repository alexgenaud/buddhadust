					<p class="f4">"Monks, when one remains focused on the allure of phenomena that offer sustenance for clinging,<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose that there were a great tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">All its roots growing downward and outward would provide it with water and nutriment, so that the great tree — thus nourished, thus sustained — would stand for a long, long time.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, when one remains focused on the allure of phenomena that offer sustenance for clinging, craving grows.</p>

					<p class="f4">From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"But when one remains focused on the drawbacks of phenomena that offer sustenance for clinging, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose there were a great tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">A man would come, bringing a shovel and basket, and would cut down the tree at its root.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having cut it at the root, he would dig it up.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having dug it up, he would pull out the roots, down to the rootlets and root fibers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he would cut the tree into pieces; having cut the pieces, he would split them; having split them, he would make them into slivers.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having made the slivers, he would dry them in the wind and sun.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having dried them in the wind and sun, he would burn them in a fire.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having burned them in a fire, he would reduce them to ashes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having reduced them to ashes, he would winnow them before a high wind or let them be washed away by a swift-flowing stream</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus the great tree, cut at the root, would be made like a palmyra stump, deprived of the conditions of development, not destined for future arising.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, when one remains focused on the drawbacks of phenomena that offer sustenance for clinging, craving ceases.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>

					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of stress and suffering."</p>
