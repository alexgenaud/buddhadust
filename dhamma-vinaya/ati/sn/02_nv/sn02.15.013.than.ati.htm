					<p class="f4">Then thirty monks from Pāva—all wilderness dwellers, all alms-goers, all cast-off rag wearers, all triple-robe wearers, all still with fetters, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One, "These thirty monks from Pāva... are all still with fetters.</p>

					<p class="f4">What if I were to teach them the Dhamma in such a way that in this very sitting their minds, through lack of clinging, would be released from effluents?"</p>

					<p class="f4">So he addressed the monks: "Monks."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is greater, the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time, or the water in the four great oceans?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the blood we have shed from having our heads cut off while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time, not the water in the four great oceans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the greater: the blood you have shed from having your heads cut off while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time, not the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The blood you have shed when, being cows, you had your cow-heads cut off: Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The blood you have shed when, being water buffaloes, you had your water buffalo-heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, being rams, you had your ram-heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, being goats, you had your goat-heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, being deer, you had your deer-heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, being chickens, you had your chicken-heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, being pigs, you had your pig-heads cut off: Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The blood you have shed when, arrested as thieves plundering villages, you had your heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, arrested as highway thieves, you had your heads cut off...</p>

					<p class="f4">when, arrested as adulterers, you had your heads cut off: Long has this been greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries—enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>

					<p class="f4">Gratified, the monks delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>

					<p class="f4">And while this explanation was being given, the minds of the thirty monks from Pāva—through lack of clinging—were released from effluents.</p>
