					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p3">3</a>]</span> Whenever Summoner was split, the Dasarahas inserted another peg in it, until the time came when Summoner's original wooden body had disappeared and only a conglomeration of pegs remained.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p4">4</a>]</span> "In the same way, in the course of the future there will be monks who won't listen when discourses that are words of the Tathāgata — deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness — are being recited. They won't lend ear, won't set their hearts on knowing them, won't regard these teachings as worth grasping or mastering.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p6">6</a>]</span> But they will listen when discourses that are literary works — the works of poets, elegant in sound, elegant in rhetoric, the work of outsiders, words of disciples — are recited. They will lend ear and set their hearts on knowing them. They will regard these teachings as worth grasping and mastering.</p>

					<p class="f4">"In this way the disappearance of the discourses that are words of the Tathāgata — deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness — will come about.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3">[<a id="p7">7</a>]</span> "Thus you should train yourselves: 'We will listen when discourses that are words of the Tathāgata — deep, deep in their meaning, transcendent, connected with emptiness — are being recited. We will lend ear, will set our hearts on knowing them, will regard these teachings as worth grasping and mastering.' That's how you should train yourselves."</p>
