					<p class="f4">And on that occasion Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf, following behind a large number of monks, was going to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">From afar, the Blessed One saw Ven. Bhaddiya the Dwarf coming, following behind a large number of monks: ugly, unsightly, stunted, treated with condescension<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> by most of the monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">On seeing him, the Blessed One addressed the monks, "Monks, do you see that monk coming from afar, following behind a large number of monks: ugly, unsightly, stunted, treated with condescension by most of the monks?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>

					<p class="f4">"That, monks, is a monk of great power, great might.</p>

					<p class="f4">The attainment already attained by that monk is not of a sort easily attained.</p>

					<p class="f4">And by means of it he has entered and remains in the supreme goal of the holy life for which clansmen rightly go forth from home into homelessness, directly knowing and realizing it for himself right in the here and now."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said.</p>
