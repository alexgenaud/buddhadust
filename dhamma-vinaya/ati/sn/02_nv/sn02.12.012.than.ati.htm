After the Buddha has taught the four foods, Moliya Phagguna asks who it is that feeds on the consciousness food. Gotama responds correcting his thinking from 'who feeds?' to 'what results from feeding on?', which leads into the chain of interdependent factors (paticca samuppada)." />

					<p class="f4">"Monks, there are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the second; intellectual intention the third; and consciousness the fourth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When this was said, Ven. Moḷiya Phagguna said to the Blessed One, "Lord, who feeds on the consciousness-nutriment?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Not a valid question," the Blessed One said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I don't say 'feeds.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the valid answer is, 'Consciousness-nutriment for the production of future coming-into-being.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When that has come into being and exists, then the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.'"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Lord, who makes contact?"</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> An alternative translation for this exchange—and one that, in light of the topic of nutriment, might actually be more apt—is:</p>
