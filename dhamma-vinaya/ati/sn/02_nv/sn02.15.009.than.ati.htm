					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Just as a stick thrown up in the air lands sometimes on its base, sometimes on its side, sometimes on its tip; in the same way, beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving, transmigrating and wandering on, sometimes go from this world to another world, sometimes come from another world to this.</p>

					<p>"Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries—enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>
