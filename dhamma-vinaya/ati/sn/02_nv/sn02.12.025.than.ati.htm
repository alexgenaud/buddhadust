<meta name="description" content="The Bhikkhu Thanissaro translation of Samyutta Nikaya Volume 2: (Section 12: Nidana Samyuttam: Chapter 2. Dasabala Vagga), Sutta 25. Sāriputta teaches Venerable Bumija who asks about who causes kammic consequences that it is in all cases contact that results in kammic consequences. This is repeated to the Buddha by Ānanda, and confirmed by Gotama and then Gotama goes on to explain that pleasure and pain corespond to the intent with which deeds of body, speech and mind are done. He further explains that intent can originate with the self or with another and can be done by the self either knowingly or without reflection." />

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Bhūmija, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to Ven. Sāriputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Sāriputta, "Friend Sāriputta, there are some contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There are other contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are other-made.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then there are other contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made and other-made.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And then there are still other contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain, without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In this case, friend Sāriputta, what is the Blessed One’s doctrine?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What does he teach?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Answering in what way will I speak in line with what the Blessed One has said, not misrepresent the Blessed One with what is unfactual, and answer in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma will have grounds for criticism?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"The Blessed One, my friend, has said that pleasure and pain are dependently co-arisen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what the Blessed One has said, would not be misrepresenting the Blessed One with what is unfactual, and would be answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticism.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are other-made, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made and other-made, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain, without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"That any contemplatives and brahmans—teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made—would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact: That isn’t possible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That any contemplatives and brahmans—teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure and pain are other-made...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">self-made and other-made...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">who declare that pleasure and pain, without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen—would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That isn’t possible."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now it so happened that Ven. Ānanda overheard this conversation between Ven. Sāriputta and Ven. Bhūmija.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then he went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he reported the entire conversation to the Blessed One.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">(The Blessed One said:)</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Excellent, Ānanda. Excellent.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One rightly answering would answer as Ven. Sāriputta has done.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"I have said, Ānanda, that pleasure and pain are dependently co-arisen.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dependent on what?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">One speaking in this way would be speaking in line with what I have said, would not be misrepresenting me with what is unfactual, and would be answering in line with the Dhamma so that no one whose thinking is in line with the Dhamma would have grounds for criticism.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Whatever contemplatives and brahmans, teachers of kamma, who declare that pleasure and pain are other-made...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">self-made and other-made...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen, even that is dependent on contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"That any contemplatives and brahmans—teachers of kamma who declare that pleasure and pain are self-made—would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That isn’t possible.</p>

					<p class="f4">self-made and other-made...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">without self-making or other-making, are spontaneously arisen — would be sensitive to pleasure and pain otherwise than through contact:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That isn’t possible.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When there is a body, pleasure and pain arise internally with bodily intention as the cause; or when there is speech, pleasure and pain arise internally with verbal intention as the cause; or when there is intellect, pleasure and pain arise internally with intellectual intention as the cause.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"From ignorance as a requisite condition, then either of one’s own accord one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally, or because of others one fabricates the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Either one fabricates alert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally, or one fabricates unalert the bodily fabrication on account of which that pleasure and pain arise internally.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">[Similarly with verbal and intellectual fabrications.]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now, ignorance is bound up in these things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the remainderless fading and cessation of that very ignorance, there no longer exists (the sense of) the body on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There no longer exists the speech...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">the intellect on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">There no longer exists the field, the site, the dimension, or the issue on account of which that pleasure and pain internally arise."</p>
