					<p class="f4">"Suppose, monks, that there were a pond fifty leagues wide, fifty leagues long, and fifty leagues deep, filled to overflowing with water so that a crow could drink from it, and a man would draw some water out of it with the tip of a blade of grass.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which would be greater: the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass or the water in the pond?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"The water in the pond would be far greater, lord.</p>

					<p class="f4">The water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass would be next to nothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">It wouldn't be a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth — the water drawn out with the tip of the blade of grass — when compared with the water in the pond."</p>

					<p class="f4">"In the same way, monks, for a disciple of the noble ones who is consummate in view, an individual who has broken through [to stream-entry], the suffering and stress that is totally ended and extinguished is far greater.</p>

					<p class="f4">That which remains in the state of having at most seven remaining lifetimes is next to nothing: it's not a hundredth, a thousandth, a one hundred-thousandth, when compared with the previous mass of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how great the benefit is of breaking through to the Dhamma, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">That's how great the benefit is of obtaining the Dhamma eye."</p>
