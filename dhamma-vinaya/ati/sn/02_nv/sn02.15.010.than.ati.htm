					<p class="f4">There he addressed the monks, "Monks!"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord," the monks responded to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said, "Monks, from an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">If a single person were to transmigrate and wander on for an eon, he/she would leave behind a chain of bones, a pile of bones, a heap of bones, as large as this Mount Vepulla, if there were someone to collect them and the collection were not destroyed.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
					
					      <p class="f4 in2">"The accumulation<br />
							of a single person's<br />
							bones for an eon<br />
							would be a heap<br />
							on a par with the mountain,<br />
							so said the Great Seer.<br />
							(He declared this to be<br />
							the great Mount Vepulla<br />
							to the north of Vulture's Peak<br />
							in the mountain-ring<br />
							of the Magadhans.)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span><br />
							But when that person sees<br />
							with right discernment<br />
							the four noble truths — <br />
							stress,<br />
							the cause of stress,<br />
							the transcending of stress,<br />
							and the noble eightfold path,<br />
							the way to the stilling of stress — <br />
							having wandered on<br />
							seven times at most, then,<br />
							with the ending of all fetters,<br />
							he makes an end<br />
							of stress."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Magadha was a kingdom in the time of the Buddha, corresponding roughly to the present day state of Bihar. Its capital city, Rājagaha, was surrounded by a ring of five mountains. Vulture's Peak, a secluded rock outcrop in the middle of the ring, was a spot frequented by the Buddha.</p>
