					<p class="f4">Then a certain monk went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the monk said to the Blessed One, "How long, lord, is an eon?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long, monk, is an eon.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's not easy to count as 'so many years' or 'so many hundreds of years' or 'so many thousands of years' or 'so many hundreds of thousands of years.'"</p>

					<p class="f4">"But is it possible to give an analogy, lord?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"It is, monk," said the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose there were an iron fortress — a league long, a league wide, a league high — full of mustard seeds packed tight, and a man would come along once every hundred years and take from it a single mustard seed.</p>

					<p class="f4">More quickly would that great heap of mustard seed waste away and be consumed by that effort, but not the eon.</p>

					<p class="f4">That’s how long, monk, an eon is.</p>

					<p class="f4">And of eons of such length, not just one eon has been wandered-through, not just one hundred eons have been wandered-through, not just one thousand eons have been wandered-through, not just one hundred-thousand eons have been wandered-through.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries  —  enough to become disenchanted with all fabrications, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>
