					<p class="f4">For one who knows what and sees what is there the ending of effluents?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is feeling, such its origination, such its disappearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is perception, such its origination, such its disappearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such are fabrications, such their origination, such their disappearance.</p>

					<p class="f4">Such is consciousness, such its origination, such its disappearance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The ending of effluents is for one who knows in this way and sees in this way.</p>

					<p class="f4">"The knowledge of ending in the presence of ending has its prerequisite, I tell you.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is not without a prerequisite.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is its prerequisite?</p>
