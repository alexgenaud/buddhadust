Mahā Kassapa and Ven. Sāriputta were staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Sāriputta, emerging from his seclusion in the evening, went to Ven. Mahā Kassapa and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>

					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, he said to Ven. Mahā Kassapa, "It is said, friend Kassapa, that a person without ardency, without compunction,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is incapable of self-awakening, incapable of unbinding, incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now, how is a person without ardency, without compunction, incapable of self-awakening, incapable of unbinding, incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage?</p>

					<p class="f4">And how is a person ardent and compunctious capable of self-awakening, capable of unbinding, capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage?"</p>

					<p class="f4">Ven. Mahā Kassapa:</p>

					<p class="f4">"There is the case, friend, where a monk, (thinking,) 'Unarisen evil, unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' arouses no ardency.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking,) 'Arisen evil, unskillful qualities not being abandoned in me...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unarisen skillful qualities not arising in me ...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arisen skillful qualities ceasing in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' he arouses no ardency.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one is without ardency.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one a person without compunction?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, (thinking,) 'Unarisen evil, unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' feels no compunction.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking,) 'Arisen evil, unskillful qualities not being abandoned in me...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unarisen skillful qualities not arising in me ...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arisen skillful qualities ceasing in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' he feels no compunction. This is how one is without compunction.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how a person without ardency, without compunction, is incapable of self-awakening, incapable of unbinding, incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one ardent?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, (thinking,) 'Unarisen evil, unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' arouses ardency.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking,) 'Arisen evil, unskillful qualities not being abandoned in me...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unarisen skillful qualities not arising in me ...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arisen skillful qualities ceasing in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' he arouses ardency.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one is ardent.</p>

					<p class="f4">"And how is one compunctious?</p>

					<p class="f4">There is the case where a monk, (thinking,) 'Unarisen evil, unskillful qualities arising in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' feels compunction.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking,) 'Arisen evil, unskillful qualities not being abandoned in me...' ...</p>

					<p class="f4">'Unarisen skillful qualities not arising in me ...' ... 'Arisen skillful qualities ceasing in me would lead to what is unbeneficial,' he feels compunction.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is how one is compunctious.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is how a person ardent and compunctious is capable of self-awakening, capable of unbinding, capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There is alliteration in the Pali here: "Without ardency" is <i>anātāpī; "</i>without compunction," <i>anottāpī.</i> Ven. Sāriputta is apparently referring here to the teaching in <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm#p34">Iti 34</a>:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">A person without ardency, without compunction, is incapable of self-awakening, incapable of unbinding, incapable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage. A person ardent and compunctious is capable of self-awakening, capable of unbinding, capable of attaining the unexcelled security from bondage.</p>

							      <p class="f4 in4">Without ardency, without compunction,<br />
									lazy, with low persistence,<br />
									full of sloth and drowsiness,<br />
									shameless, without respect:<br />
									He's incapable, a monk like this,<br />
									of touching superlative self-awakening.<br />
									But whoever is mindful, masterful,<br />
									absorbed in jhāna,<br />
									ardent, compunctious, and heedful,<br />
									cutting the fetter of birth and aging,<br />
									touches right here and now<br />
									a self-awakening unsurpassed.</p>
