					<p class="f4">"There are these four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Which four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Physical food, gross or refined; contact as the second, intellectual intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">These are the four nutriments for the maintenance of beings who have come into being or for the support of those in search of a place to be born.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how is physical food to be regarded? Suppose a couple, husband and wife, taking meager provisions, were to travel through a desert.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">With them would be their only baby son, dear and appealing.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the meager provisions of the couple going through the desert would be used up and depleted while there was still a stretch of the desert yet to be crossed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The thought would occur to them, 'Our meager provisions are used up and depleted while there is still a stretch of this desert yet to be crossed.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">What if we were to kill this only baby son of ours, dear and appealing, and make dried meat and jerky.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That way — chewing on the flesh of our son — at least the two of us would make it through this desert. Otherwise, all three of us would perish.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they would kill their only baby son, loved and endearing, and make dried meat and jerky.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Chewing on the flesh of their son, they would make it through the desert.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">While eating the flesh of their only son, they would beat their breasts, (crying,) 'Where have you gone, our only baby son?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Where have you gone, our only baby son?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now what do you think, monks?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would that couple eat that food playfully or for intoxication, or for putting on bulk, or for beatification?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"No, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Wouldn't they eat that food simply for the sake of making it through that desert?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Yes, lord."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In the same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of physical food to be regarded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When physical food is comprehended, passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When passion for the five strings of sensuality is comprehended, there is no fetter bound by which a disciple of the noble ones would come back again to this world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how is the nutriment of contact to be regarded?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose a flayed cow were to stand leaning against a wall.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">The creatures living in the wall would chew on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it were to stand leaning against a tree, the creatures living in the tree would chew on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it were to stand exposed to water, the creatures living in the water would chew on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If it were to stand exposed to the air, the creatures living in the air would chew on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">For wherever the flayed cow were to stand exposed, the creatures living there would chew on it.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of contact to be regarded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the nutriment of contact is comprehended, the three feelings [pleasure, pain, neither pleasure nor pain] are comprehended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the three feelings are comprehended, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regarded?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose there were a pit of glowing embers, deeper than a man's height, full of embers that were neither flaming nor smoking, and a man were to come along — loving life, hating death, loving pleasure, abhorring pain — and two strong men, having grabbed him by the arms, were to drag him to the pit of embers.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">To get far away would be that man's intention, far away would be his wish, far away would be his aspiration.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Why is that?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Because he would realize, 'If I fall into this pit of glowing embers, I will meet with death from that cause, or with death-like pain.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, I tell you, is the nutriment of intellectual intention to be regarded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the nutriment of intellectual intention is comprehended, the three forms of craving [for sensuality, for becoming, and for non-becoming] are comprehended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the three forms of craving are comprehended, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"And how is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Suppose that, having arrested a thief, a criminal, they were to show him to the king:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'This is a thief, a criminal for you, your majesty.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Impose on him whatever punishment you like.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the king would say, 'Go, men, and stab him in the morning with a hundred spears.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they would stab him in the morning with a hundred spears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the king would say at noon, 'Men, how is that man?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Still alive, your majesty.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the king would say, 'Go, men, and stab him at noon with a hundred spears.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they would stab him at noon with a hundred spears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the king would say in the evening, 'Men, how is that man?'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">'Still alive, your majesty.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So the king would say, 'Go, men, and stab him in the evening with a hundred spears.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">So they would stab him in the evening with a hundred spears.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now what do you think, monks?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Would that man, being stabbed with three hundred spears a day, experience pain and distress from that cause?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Even if he were to be stabbed with only one spear, lord, he would experience pain and distress from that cause, to say nothing of three hundred spears."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"In the same way, I tell you, monks, is the nutriment of consciousness to be regarded.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When the nutriment of consciousness is comprehended, name-and-form is comprehended.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">When name-and-form is comprehended, I tell you, there is nothing further for a disciple of the noble ones to do."</p>
