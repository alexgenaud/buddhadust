					<p class="f4">Then Ven. Nanda, the Blessed One's maternal cousin, wearing robes pressed inside &amp; out, having put mascara on his eyes and carrying a glazed bowl, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down to him, sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, "It's not proper, Nanda, that—as the son of a good family gone forth through conviction from the home life into homelessness—you wear robes pressed inside &amp; out, that you put mascara on your eyes, and that you carry a glazed bowl.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"This would be proper for you as the son of a good family gone forth through conviction from the home life into homelessness: that you become a wilderness dweller, one who goes for alms, who wears cast-off cloth, and that you dwell indifferent to sensuality."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what the Blessed One said. Having said that, the One Well-gone, the Teacher, said further:</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"When will I see Nanda<br />
					a wilderness dweller, wearing cast-off cloth,<br />
					getting by on the alms of strangers,<br />
					indifferent to sensuality?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, at a later time, Ven. Nanda became a wilderness dweller, one who went for alms, who wore cast-off cloth, and he dwelt indifferent to sensuality.</p>
