					<p class="f4">There the Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"From an inconceivable beginning comes the wandering-on.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not discernible, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">What do you think, monks?</p>

					<p class="f4">Which is greater, the tears you have shed while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time — crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — or the water in the four great oceans?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the tears we have shed while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time — crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Excellent, monks.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excellent.</p>

					<p class="f4">It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.</p>

					<p class="f4">"This is the greater: the tears you have shed while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time — crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time — crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — are greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a father...</p>

					<p class="f4">the death of a brother...</p>

					<p class="f4">the death of a sister...</p>

					<p class="f4">the death of a son...</p>

					<p class="f4">the death of a daughter...</p>

					<p class="f4">loss with regard to relatives...</p>

					<p class="f4">loss with regard to wealth...</p>

					<p class="f4">loss with regard to disease.</p>

					<p class="f4">The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating and wandering this long, long time — crying and weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — are greater than the water in the four great oceans.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Why is that?</p>

					<p class="f4">From an inconceivable beginning comes transmigration.</p>

					<p class="f4">A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating and wandering on.</p>

					<p class="f4">Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."</p>
