Sāriputta and Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita were staying near Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park at Isipatana.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then in the evening, emerging from his seclusion, Ven. Mahā Koṭṭhita went to Ven. Sāriputta and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">After an exchange of friendly greetings and courtesies, he sat to one side.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">As he was sitting there he said to Ven. Sāriputta, "Now tell me, Sāriputta my friend: Are aging-and-death self-made or other-made or both self-made and other-made, or — without self-making or other-making — do they arise spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that aging-and-death are self-made, that they are other-made, that they are both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — they arise spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from birth as a requisite condition comes aging-and-death."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now tell me, friend Sāriputta: Is birth....</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is becoming....</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is clinging/sustenance...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is craving....</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is feeling....</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Is contact....</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Are the six sense media self-made or other-made or both self-made and other-made, or — without self-making or other-making — do they arise spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that the six sense media are self-made, that they are other-made, that they are both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — they arise spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from name and form as a requisite condition come the six sense media."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now tell me, friend Sāriputta: Is name-and-form self-made or other-made or both self-made and other-made, or — without self-making or other-making — does it arise spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that name-and-form is self-made, that it is other-made, that it is both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — it arises spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Now tell me, friend Sāriputta: Is consciousness self-made or other-made or both self-made and other-made, or — without self-making or other-making, does it arise spontaneously?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that consciousness is self-made, that it is other-made, that it is both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — it arises spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Just now, I understood Ven. Sāriputta's statement as, 'It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that name-and-form is self-made, that it is other-made, that it is both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — it arises spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">But then I understood your statement as, 'It's not the case, Koṭṭhita my friend, that consciousness is self-made, that it is other-made, that it is both self-made and other-made, or that — without self-making or other-making — it arises spontaneously.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">However, from name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now how is the meaning of these statements to be understood?"</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"Very well then, Koṭṭhita my friend, I will give you an analogy; for there are cases where it is through the use of an analogy that intelligent people can understand the meaning of what is being said.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">It is as if two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, from name-and-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-and-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From name and form as a requisite condition come the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From birth as a requisite condition, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair come into play.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the origination of this entire mass of suffering and stress.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If one were to pull away one of those sheaves of reeds, the other would fall; if one were to pull away the other, the first one would fall.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">In the same way, from the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of consciousness, from the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-and-form.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of name-and-form comes the cessation of the six sense media.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">From the cessation of birth, then aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, and despair all cease.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Such is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering and stress."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"It's amazing, friend Sāriputta. It's astounding, friend Sāriputta, how well that was said by Ven. Sāriputta.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And I rejoice in Ven. Sāriputta's good statements with regard to these 36 topics.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to aging-and-death, he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to aging-and-death, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
					
					<p class="f4">If — through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and lack of clinging/sustenance with regard to aging-and-death — he is released, then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to birth, he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to birth, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">[Similarly with becoming, clinging/sustenance, craving, feeling, contact, the six sense media, name and form, and consciousness.]</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to fabrications, he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to fabrications, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If — through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and lack of clinging/sustenance with regard to fabrications — he is released, then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here and now.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">"If a monk teaches the Dhamma for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to ignorance, he deserves to be called a monk who is a speaker of Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If he practices for the sake of disenchantment, dispassion, and cessation with regard to ignorance, he deserves to be called a monk who practices the Dhamma in accordance with the Dhamma.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">If — through disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, and lack of clinging/sustenance with regard to ignorance — he is released, then he deserves to be called a monk who has attained unbinding in the here and now."</p>
