					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> According to <a href='../../mn/mn.044.than.ati.htm'>MN 44</a>, directed thought and evaluation constitute verbal fabrication, which is why the second jhāna — the level of concentration in which these fabrications are stilled — is called noble silence.</p>
