Then the Blessed One said to the Venerable Vakkali: "Enough, Vakkali, do not try to get up.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> There are these seats made ready. I will sit down there." And he sat down on a seat that was ready. Then he said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Are you feeling better, Vakkali? Are you bearing up? Are your pains getting better and not worse? Are there signs that they are getting better and not worse?"<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord, I do not feel better, I am not bearing up. I have severe pains, and they are getting worse, not better. There is no sign of improvement, only of worsening."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you any doubts, Vakkali? Have you any cause for regret?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Indeed, Lord, I have many doubts. I have much cause for regret."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Have you nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"No, Lord, I have nothing to reproach myself about as regards morals."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Well then, Vakkali, if you have nothing to reproach yourself about as regards morals, you must have some worry or scruple that is troubling you."</p>

					<p class="f4">"For a long time, Lord, I have wanted to come and set eyes on the Blessed One, but I had not the strength in this body to come and see the Blessed One."</p>
