					<h4><a id="intro">Translator's Introduction</a></h4>

					<p>The present work offers a translation of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/iti/idx_iti.htm">Itivuttaka,</a> a collection of 112 short discourses of the Buddha in both prose and verse. The text belongs to the Pali Canon of the Theravada school, being placed between the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm">Udāna</a> and the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/snp/idx_snp.htm">Sutta Nipata</a>. It was previously translated by F.L. Woodward and published together with his translation of the Udāna in <i>Minor Anthologies of the Pali Canon,</i> Vol. II (London, 1935).</p>
					
					<p>According to the commentarial tradition, the suttas or discourses of the Itivuttaka were collected by the woman lay-disciple <a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pts/an/01_ones/an01.258-295.wood.pts.htm#p260">Khujjuttarā</a> from sermons given by the Buddha while he was staying at Kosambī. Khujjuttarā was a servant of Sāmavāti, the consort of King Udena. She had become a stream-enterer after meeting th¢ Buddha and subsequently converted the women of the palace headed by Sāmavāti to the teaching. She used to go regularly to listen to the Buddha and then later repeated what she had heard to the other women. The collection of these sayings became the Itivuttaka. It is said that the emphatic statements at the beginning and end of each of the suttas, reproduced here only in the first and last,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> were made by Khujjuttara to stress that they were the Buddha's words and not her own.</p>
					
					<p>Whether or not this story is true, the Itivuttaka is the only book in the Pali Canon that introduces and concludes its suttas in this fashion, and it is from the opening statement that the title is derived: "This was said <i>(vuttaṃ)</i> by the Lord ... so <i>(iti)</i> I heard" — hence <i>Itivuttaka,</i> "The So-was-said" or "Sayings."</p>
					
					<p>These "Sayings" are grouped into four unequal sections arranged, like the <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sutta_toc.htm#AN"><i>Anguttara Nikaya,</i></a> according to the number of items they contain, from one to four. Besides these four sections — The Ones, The Twos, The Threes, and The Fours — the text is further subdivided into vaggas, groups of roughly ten suttas. But to simplify the presentation, in this translation these sub-groupings have been ignored. Only the four main sections have been retained and the suttas numbered from 1 to 112, as in the PTS edition. A number of the suttas and verses are also found in other parts of the Sutta Pitaka, especially the <i>Anguttara Nikaya,</i> but many are unique to this collection.</p>
					
					<p>In translating the <i>Itivuttaka</i> I have attempted to follow the text as closely as possible and to produce an exact and literal rendition. With the verses, however, while remaining faithful to the meaning, I occasionally found it necessary to depart from the syntax of the Pali. Although I did not attempt to produce a metrical translation, by transposing lines and words and controlling the number of syllables in the line, I aimed at producing a readable and rhythmic English rendering of the original Pali verse.</p>
					
					<p>In this translation of the <i>Itivuttaka,</i> as in my rendering of the <i>Udāna,</i> a few words have been left untranslated. <i>Dhamma</i> is the "real truth," the "essential idea" and the "ideal" of the Buddha's teaching. When this Dhamma is revealed to others, the person who understands it is able to attain the final aim of the teaching: to overcome suffering and realize Nibbāna, the ultimate goal.</p>

						</div>

					<p>The word <i>bhikkhu</i> is often translated as "monk," but at the time of the Buddha it was not used in such a general sense. A bhikkhu can be defined as "one who is dependent upon another's gifts of alms as his means of subsistence" (see Suttas <a href="#p91">91</a> and <a href="#p107">107</a>), but "almsman" or "beggar," the literal meaning, would be quite misleading as it does not imply the honoured status accorded to the bhikkhu. The feminine is <i>bhikkhunī,</i> a Buddhist nun, mentioned only occasionally in the present work. Ordinary people called the Buddha's followers "recluses" <i>(samaṇa),</i> which approximates more to what we understand as a "monk" or celibate. A <i>samaṇa</i> was one who had actually forsaken the confined and circumscribed family life of a householder. But in later times this general term tended to be used less often when the Saṅgha, the monastic community, had become well established, identifiable and settled. In the earliest period the Buddha usually used the word "bhikkhu" when addressing his following of samaṇas, and the same word was used by the monks amongst themselves and by the inner circle of faithful layfollowers who were established in the Dhamma. And it is to these that the <i>Itivuttaka</i> and the other suttas of the Pali Canon were originally directed.</p>
					
					<p>Mention is also made in the <i>Itivuttaka</i> of the <i>devas.</i> These are gods, inhabitants of the heavenly worlds, but they are also mortal beings subject to fall when the good <i>kamma</i> that brought them to that realm is exhausted (see Sutta 83). Above the devas are the <i>brahmās,</i> high divinities still more powerful than the devas but likewise transient. Their chief is Mahā Brahmā, "the Great Brahmā," who sometimes deludedly fancies himself to be an omnipotent creator.</p>
					
					<p>This translation was made from the PTS edition of the <i>Itivuttaka,</i> but other editions of the text, especially the Burmese Chaṭṭhasaṅgāyana edition, were also consulted for alternative readings of doubtful passages and for clearing up mistakes and omissions in the text, fortunately few in number. This is in marked contrast to the PTS edition of the <i>Udāna,</i> which is full of errors. In compiling the notes frequent use was made of the commentary, the <i>Paramatthadīpanī</i> of Ācariya Dhammapāla. To understand a text, in the places where the use of a word or phrase is ambiguous, the commentary is essential for deciding the traditional meaning and significance of these passages.</p>
					
					<p>The titles of the suttas are taken from the Burmese edition of the text. The PTS edition does not include them, though they can be deduced from the summaries found at the end of each vagga. Woodward also does not give them in his translation. The use of initial titles is actually a modern innovation of the printed book. The tradition in Pali literature is either the end-name — often several alternatives are given for important works — or else the summary at the end of the vagga, making use of one or more key words from each of the suttas. The summaries originally served as a device to aid memory in an oral tradition which lacked the benefit of the printed word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> The introductory and concluding words found in each sutta are omitted after this first discourse to avoid unnecessary repetition.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> <i>Atthā:</i> both the meaning (significance and intention) of the Buddha's words, and the aim or goal of the Teaching.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Non-returning <i>(anāgāmitā)</i> is the third stage of the noble path, above stream-entry and once-returning but below arahantship. One who has reached this stage has eradicated the fetters of sensual desire and ill will and is reborn in one of the five celestial realms called the Pure Abodes <i>(suddhāvāsa),</i> there to attain arahantship. <i>Comy.</i>, points out that greed <i>(lobha)</i> here bears the narrower meaning of sensual lust <i>(kāmarāga).</i> While the non-returner abandons sensual lust, greed for being is eliminated only by the arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> This refers to the three subhuman realms of existence: hell, the animal realm, and the world of hungry ghosts <i>(peta).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> In contrast to greed, hate <i>(dosa)</i> is eliminated in its entirety by the path of the non-returner. According to the <i>Comy.</i>., among the unwholesome qualities mentioned in the following suttas, anger and contempt are fully eradicated by the non-returner, while delusion and conceit are eliminated only in part, their full eradication requiring attainment of the path of arahantship.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p class="f2">This is incorrect. The 'All' always means the six realms of the senses. This is equavalent to the upaddana-k-khandha, so perhaps Ireland is misunderstanding what was intended to be an explanation as being the thing itself.</p>

						</div>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> According to the <i>Comy.</i>., the "All" refers to <i>sakkāya-dhammā:</i> the factors of personally, that is, the five aggregates of grasping <i>(upādānakkhandha)</i> — form, feeling, perception, mental activities, and consciousness. These comprise the "all" or totality of our experience. <i>Comy.</i>, explains "direct knowledge" <i>(abhiññā)</i> as knowing things in a superior mode by way of their undistorted characteristics. "Full understanding" <i>(pariñña)</i> is explained as the investigation of conditioned things as impermanent, suffering, and not-self, culminating in the abandonment of attachment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Or repeated birth, <i>punabbhava.</i> See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/ud/idx_ud.htm#p30">Ud 3.10.</a> <i>Bhava:</i> being, becoming, or existence, is one of the factors in the formula of dependent arising <i>(paṭicca-samuppāda).</i> Being arises from grasping and leads to birth, death, and suffering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> These five discourses have been abbreviated<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></span> as they merely repeat the previous one, substituting greed, etc., for conceit. The verses are identical with those of 1-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Ignorance <i>(avijjā)</i> — synonymous with delusion <i>(moha)</i> — about suffering, its origin in craving, its cessation, and the noble eightfold path that leads to its cessation. <i>Saṃsāra</i> is the perpetual wandering on from birth to birth, the cycle of rebirths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Aṅga means a limb or constituent part, hence, as here and in the next discourse, an essential factor or requirement for gaining release. Wise attention <i>(yoniso mananasikāra)</i> means attending to aspects of a thing or situation in a way that is helpful to the practice of the path. The commentaries mention considering things as impermanent, unsatisfactory, not-self, and foul rather than the opposites, and the avoidance of fruitless speculation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> A learner <i>(sekha)</i> is a noble disciple who has not yet become an arahant but is training himself for that goal. The arahant or perfected one is called an <i>asekha:</i> one who has no more to learn, who has completed the training. Supreme security from bondage, <i>anuttara yogakkhema,</i> is release from the four bonds <i>(yogā):</i> sensual desire, desire for being, views, and ignorance.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> In <i>Vism</i> Chap. III the good friend <i>(kalyāṇamitta)</i> is a teacher, the giver of the meditation subject, and at SN 3:18/S I 88<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="edfn2" href="#edn2">ed2</a>]</sup></span> it is said that good friendship encourages one to develop and cultivate the noble eightfold path. In this same discourse the Buddha says: "It is because of my being a good friend, Ānanda, that beings liable to birth are released from birth, that beings liable to old age are released from old age, that beings liable to sickness ... death ... sorrow ... suffering ... despair are released from despair."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The fetters <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/sanyojana.htm"><i>(saṃyojana)</i></a> are ten in number: personality view, doubt, clinging to external observances, sensual lust, ill will, craving for form, craving for the formless, conceit, restlessness, and ignorance. The stream-enterer has cut off the first three; the once- returner has also weakened the fourth and fifth; the non-returner has removed the first five; and the arahant has destroyed all ten.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> <i>Comy.</i>, refers to the schism in the <i>Saṅgha</i> created by Devadatta, the Buddha's cousin. Concerning Devadatta see <a href="#p89">Sutta 89</a> and notes. Maliciously creating a schism in the <i>Saṅgha</i> leads to immediate rebirth in hell for an aeon.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Those ordinary people whose faith is as yet undeveloped (<i>Comy.</i>.), that is, those people who, without committing themselves, have shown an interest in the Buddha's teaching.</p>

						<div class="floatrpp wpx200 marl6">
							<p class="f2">"without beginning or end": without known or knowable beginning or end</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> A <i>kappa,</i> an aeon or world-cycle, is in Buddhist cosmology a vast period of time during which the universe evolves and declines, expands and contracts. These periodic cycles continue without beginning or end.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> "(He),is not deprived": he is not excluded from attaining security or freedom from the four bonds and thus becoming an arahant. See <a href="#n10">note 10</a> above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> This is a difficult idiomatic phrase that occurs in several places in the Pali Canon. <i>Comy.</i>, explains: "Just as something that has been carried is cast aside, so he is placed in hell, having been conveyed there by his own (bad) deeds." That this is intended is made clearer in the third verse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> <i>Netti,</i> pp. 130-31, has a somewhat different version of this (and the next) discourse, both in the prose and the verse. See <i>The Guide,</i> pp. 177-78. <i>Netti</i> holds some extra lines of verse and in the first stanza replaces "the Buddha" by "the Teacher" <i>(satthā),</i> the more usual epithet in such contexts.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>Pasnnacitta:</i> a clear, bright, purified, and confident mind. According to the <i>Comy.</i>, it means having faith in the Three Jewels and in actions <i>(kamma)</i> and their results.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> He knows from personal experience by remembering his former lives.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Loving-kindness <i>(mettā)</i> is the first of the four "divine abidings" <i>(brahmavihāra)</i> or boundless states, the other three being compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> The plane of Streaming Radiance <i>(Ābhassara)</i> is not destroyed at the end of the aeon. When a new universe begins, beings come from there to inhabit it. The first to be born is the Great Brahmā, a high divinity in the Buddhist cosmos.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Sakka is the chief god or deva of the Tāvatiṃsa (the heaven of the "Thirty-three"), one of the heavens of the sensuous world <i>(kāma-loka),</i> which is below the form world <i>(rūpa-loka)</i> inhabited by the brahmās.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> The <i>cakkavatti-rājā</i> or righteous Wheel-turning Monarch is the worldly counterpart of the Buddha. It was prophesied of the Bodhisatta, the Buddha-to-be, that if he remained a householder he would become a Wheel-turning Monarch, but if he went forth into homelessness he would become a Fully Enlightened One and turn the "Wheel of Dhamma" instead of the "Wheel of Conquest." The seven jewels are emblems of royalty: the wheel-jewel, the elephant-jewel, the horse-jewel, the woman-jewel, the gem-jewel, the steward-jewel, and the counselor-jewel. See <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p129">MN 129.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> <i>Dāna,</i> giving or generosity, is traditionally the most basic source of "merit" in all Buddhist lands. Self-mastery <i>(dama)</i> is control of the mind and the senses so that passion, etc., do not overwhelm one. Refraining <i>(saññama)</i> is control of bodily actions and speech. Thus these three cover all possible ways of performing voluntary actions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Diligence <i>(appamāda)</i> means being energetic and ever mindful in cultivating what is good and wholesome; it is the foundation for all progress. Its opposite is negligence <i>(pamāda)</i> by which the mind is distracted from the good and becomes overwhelmed by defilements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> This refers to the stream-enterer, who is reborn at most seven more times before attaining release.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> "If they were to enjoy, as I now enjoy" <i>(Comy.).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> <i>Bhuñjati</i> means both to eat and to enjoy, to make use of something.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> The "three grounds for making merit" <i>(puññakiriya-vatthu)</i> are giving, virtue, and mind-development; see Sutta 11. <i>Comy.</i>, glosses "productive of a future birth" <i>(opadhikāni)</i> as meaning productive of a successful individual existence, yielding results at conception and during life. The term is contrasted with grounds for making merit aimed at release from future birth, such as by developing insight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Mind-release <i>(cetovimutti)</i> is the culmination of the mind's purgation of emotional impurities by the practice of tranquillity <i>(samatha).</i> There are various kinds of mind-release, and although they are very exalted, the only one that is irreversible is the unshakeable mind-release <i>(akuppā cetovimutti)</i> possessed by an arahant. The practice of loving-kindness, the first of the four divine abidings, culminates in the boundless mind-release <i>(appamāṇā cetovimutti)</i> in which all ill will or malice <i>(vyāpada)</i> is removed from the mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> It is by being practised towards all beings equally and without exception, not just towards one person, that loving-kindness becomes boundless and the basis for mind-release.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> This refers to the legendary kings of the past who ruled righteously and made sacrifices to the gods and gave abundant alms to the needy after their victories. Later they abdicated to become seers <i>(isi),</i> hermits or holy men, and then went to heaven. The sacrifices are mentioned at Sn 303 as having been initiated by corrupt brahmins desirous of accumulating wealth. <i>Soma</i> is the sacrificial drink offered in libations to the gods.</p>
					
					<p><b>Twos</b></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> (1) The senses are regarded as "doors" by which sense objects as well as unwholesome states enter the mind. They are guarded by mindfulness. Being immoderate in eating (literally, "not knowing the measure in food") is eating without wisely reflecting and for purposes other than merely the upkeep of the body and physical health.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> (2) <i>Akatabhīruttāna.</i> <i>Comy.</i>, explains: "He has not done what gives protection to oneself from danger." Hence this phrase has been rendered "(not done) what is beneficial."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> (3) "Bad behaviour" <i>(pāpaka sīla)</i> refers to immoral conduct, uncontrolled behaviour that is considered wrong (<i>Comy.</i>.). "Bad view" is of various kinds, such as the view that actions <i>(kamma)</i> do not produce results <i>(vipāka).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> (4) The restraint of wrong behaviour by moral conduct and of unwholesome states of mind by mindfulness, and the abandoning of the defilements by meditation and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> (5) <i>Anītiha:</i> not handed down by tradition or based upon hearsay as is the Vedic lore of the brahmins. The Buddha teaches from his own direct experience of enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> (6) Direct knowledge <i>(abhiññā)</i> includes various kinds of supernormal powers, such as the recollection of past lives, and also the knowledge of the destruction of the taints, which is the attainment of arahantship. Full understanding <i>(pariññā)</i> is penetrative insight into phenomena and their characteristics as impermanent, unsatisfactory, and not-self. Here, according to the <i>Comy.</i>., the two terms mean knowledge and penetration of the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> (7) This verse is identical with that in Sutta 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> (8) That is, he has a reason for beginning to exert himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> (9) He is moved by a sense of urgency <i>(saṃvega)</i> on seeing the suffering inherent in the saṃsāric round of birth, old age, and death, and he makes a proper endeavour <i>(yoniso padhāna),</i> wise or skilful endeavour or right effort, to attain release.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> (10) <i>Tathāgata</i> is a term often used by the Buddha when referring to himself. Briefly, it means "He who has thus come" or "thus gone" (to enlightenment). The commentaries give a long and detailed explanation. For a translation, see Bhikkhu Bodhi, <i>The Discourse on the All-embracing Net of Views</i> (BPS, 1978), pp.331-44. See also Sutta 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> (11) <i>Comy.:</i> The thought of security <i>(khema-vitakka)</i> is especially connected with compassion <i>(karuṇā),</i> though it also occurs connected with loving-kindness and sympathetic joy. It is the forerunner and concomitant of the Buddha's attainment of great compassion as well as of his attainment of loving-kindness, etc. The thought of solitude <i>(paviveka-vitakka)</i> is the forerunner and concomitant of his attainment of fruition, though it also occurs in connection with the <i>jhānas,</i> etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> (12) Non-ill will <i>(avyāpajjha)</i> is a synonym for loving-kindness <i>(mettā).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> (13) Or "movable or immovable" <i>(tasaṃ vā thāvaraṃ vā).</i> According to the <i>Comy.</i>, it means those with craving and those without craving (<i>i.e.,</i> arahants). This is the first thought, the thought of security, indicative of the Buddha's great compassion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> (14) <i>Comy.</i>, identifies solitude here with the eradication and subsiding of defilements that occurred with the Buddha's attainment of enlightenment, and also with the ultimate solitude of Nibbāna, the escape from all conditioned things.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> (15) <i>Comy.</i>.: He endured or carried the entire equipment for supreme enlightenment and the undertaking of great compassion, which no one other than a great Bodhisatta could endure or carry; and he conquered Māra, whom no one else could conquer; and he performed the tasks of a Buddha, which no one else could perform.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> (16) <i>Vissantara</i> (PTS ed.), <i>vessantara</i> (Sinh. ed.), <i>visantara</i> (Burmese ed.). <i>Comy.</i>, explains etymologically: "He is called thus because he has expelled unrighteousness <i>(visamassa vantattā)</i> such as unrighteous bodily conduct, etc.; or because he guides others across after he himself has crossed over <i>(taritvā)</i> the poison <i>(visa)</i> of all defilements, or the poison of all the suffering of the round."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> (17) Māra is the Evil One, the personification of all that prevents our attainment of enlightenment. The commentaries explain Māra as the defilements, the five aggregates, and death, also as the Tempter, an evil deity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> (18) This verse also occurs at <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_1.htm#p26">MN 26</a> (1168).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> (19) On shame and fear of wrong-doing, see Sutta 15 and note 22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> (20) Clinging to name-and-form <i>(nāmarūpa),</i> or the five aggregates, ordinary people (mis-)conceive them as being a self or as belonging to a self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> (21) Penetration of the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> (22) <i>Sukka</i> means bright, pure, good, and refers to those qualities that are virtuous and wholesome, by which the mind is cleansed and purified and made radiant. "Shame" <i>(hiri)</i> is the inwardly arisen disgust with evil, the voice of conscience which inhibits one from doing wrong; "fear of wrongdoing" (ottappa) is the outwardly directed fear of the painful consequences of evil and fear of being blamed by others. The two are said to be the foundation of morality.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> (23) The prose portion to follow is identical with the inspired utterance in Ud 8.3. This discourse contrasts the unconditioned, Nibbāna, with what is caused and conditioned. The verses continue the contrast by listing synonyms for each of the two terms, concluding with the appropriate evaluation of each.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> (24) Nutriment is fourfold: material food, contact, mental volition, and consciousness. All are essential to support life. Thus, according to the Buddha, "mental food" is as important for the mind as material food is for the upkeep of the body. "Craving's cord" <i>{netti)</i> is craving for being — see <a href="#n29">note 29</a> below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> (25) The taints <i>(āsava)</i> are sensual desire, desire for being, and ignorance; see Sutta 7. "One whose taints are destroyed" <i>(kliTnnsnvn)</i> is another name for an arahant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> (26) The attainment of arahantship consists in the extinction of the defilements <i>(kilesa-parinibbāna)</i> — attachment, hate, and delusion — and while the arahant continues to live out his life, his freedom from defilements is called "the Nibbāna-element with residue left" <i>(sa-upādisesa-nibbānadhātu).</i> The "residue" is the five aggregates — the mind and the body and the senses — that continue to function.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> (27) As there is no craving and clinging ("delight"), at the arahant's death, when the body perishes, there is nothing to be projected into a future birth. Thus there takes place the final extinction of the aggregates <i>(khandha-parinibbāna),</i> which is "the Nibbāna-element with no residue left" <i>(anupādisesa-nibbānadhātu).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> (28) <i>Tādi</i>: "stable," is a term for an emancipated one, the arahant, and refers to his equanimity towards agreeable and disagreeable sense objects.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> (29) The "cord of being" <i>(bhavanetti)</i> is craving for being <i>(bhavataṇhā),</i> so called because it keeps living beings attached to the round of existence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> (30) <i>Paṭisallāna.</i> <i>Comy.</i>, explains as physical solitude <i>(kāya-viveka),</i> the prerequisite for mental seclusion achieved by meditation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> (31) <i>Comy.</i>, glosses insight <i>(vipassanā)</i> as the sevenfold contemplation: of impermanence, suffering, not-self, dispassion, detachment, cessation, and relinquishment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> (32) <i>Comy.</i>.: The five aggregates as impermanent, etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> (33) Māra, the Evil One, is conceived as leading a large army (of defilements) which must be faced and defeated to gain enlightenment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> (34) This refers to the cultivation of insight and understanding after establishing mindfulness, clarity, and tranquillity of mind as a basis. <i>Comy.</i>, also mentions the cultivation of the <a href="../../../../backmatter/glossology/glossology/satta_sambojjhanga.htm"><i>bojjhaṅga,</i></a> the seven factors of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation, energy, rapture, tranquillity, concentration, and equanimity.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> (35) These verses are found at <a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/kd/dhp/idx_dhp.htm#ch22">Dhp 306-308.</a></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> (36) The cessation of being <i>(bhava-nirodha)</i> is Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> (37) Those who strongly crave for being and delight in it incline towards the eternalist view which posits a self existing eternally in some form after death. Thus they "hold back" from Nibbāna as the cessation of being.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> (38) Those who crave for non-being or personal annihilation "overreach" in adopting an annihilationist view. Both the eternalist and the annihilationist fall into the trap of thinking in static terms about the "self" i.e., that there is a permanent self which continues forever (eternalism) or else is permanent only for a fixed period during life and stops at death (annihilationism).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> (39) The correct attitude of "those with vision," according to the Buddha, is to avoid thinking in terms of "self" and to tackle the root of the problem by eradicating the ignorance and craving that give rise to both wrong views.</p>
					
					<p><b>Threes</b></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> (1) <i>Tacasāraṃ.</i> <i>Comy.</i>, explains that this is a name for the bamboo, so called because its pith is exposed outside rather than concealed within. These plants die after seeding.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> (2) The form element <i>(rūpa-dhātu)</i> is the realm of subtle form, the worlds of the brahmās and the <i>jhānas</i> that lead to rebirth into that realm. The formless element <i>(arūpa-dhātu)</i> is the formless realm and the formless <i>jhānas</i> that lead to rebirth there. The element of cessation <i>(nirodha-dhātu)</i> is Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> (3) The point is not to settle in "form" or in the "formless," which are blissful and peaceful states attained through meditation, but to realize that they are still subject to impermanence and death. Only in Nibbāna is perfect freedom to be found. The attainment of <i>jhāna</i> can be such a profound experience that it may easily be mistaken for the ultimate goal. In fact, entire religions and theologies have been founded upon and reinforced by such experiences.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> (4) <i>Kāyena phassayitvā.</i> Literally, "having touched with the body." According to the <i>Comy.</i>., "body" <i>(kāya)</i> in this context denotes the mind or mental factors <i>(nāma-kāya)</i> rather than the physical body <i>(rūpa-kaya).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> (5) By penetrative understanding of feelings according to the method of the four noble truths and by attaining the noble path of the arahant. Feelings are seen as the truth of suffering, as is shown in the next sutta (No. 4). They originate in contact <i>(phassa)</i> and lead to craving, as stated in the formula of dependent arising <i>(paṭiccca-samuppāda)</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> (7) Search <i>(esanā)</i> is a questing or seeking and a form of longing that arises through ignorance and craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> (8) According to the <i>Comy.</i>., "the search for a holy life" means seeking and holding various wrong views such as eternalism and annihilationism, various theories about the soul and the world, etc. See Ud 6.4-6.6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> (9) Māra is depicted leading his army into battle while mounted upon an elephant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> (11) A non-learner <i>(asekha)</i> is an arahant, one who has no more to learn, who has completed the course of training.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> (12) Virtue, concentration, and wisdom that are complete and perfected. These three are called the three trainings <i>(sikkhā)</i> and 'form the threefold division of the noble eightfold path.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> (13) These verses are identical with those in Sutta 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> (14) The fleshly eye <i>(maṃsa-cakkhu)</i> is the physical sense-organ, the vision of which is limited in comparison to the other two. The divine or heavenly eye <i>(dibba-cakkhu)</i> is one of the direct knowledges <i>(abhiññā)</i> by which one sees the arising and passing away of beings according to their deeds. The wisdom eye <i>(paññā-cakkhu)</i> is that which penetrates the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> (15) <i>Comy.</i>, states that the occurrence, of the fleshly eye is the path, or basis, for the divine eye; for the divine eye arises in one whose natural sight is unimpaired, since he arouses the divine eye by extending the light of the <i>kasiṇa</i> object, and he cannot do so without having first acquired the learning sign <i>(uggahanimitta)</i> in the <i>kasiṇa</i> disc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> (16) <i>Comy.</i>.: The knowledge of the destruction of the taints arises from the wisdom eye. By arousing and developing the eye of noble wisdom, one is released from all the suffering of the round (of existence).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> (17) They are faculties <i>(indriya)</i> in the sense of ruling, controlling, and dominating other factors associated with themselves. There are altogether twenty-two faculties arranged under various groupings of which the three listed here are exclusively supramundane.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> (18) <i>Comy.</i>.: The first is the wisdom pertaining to the path of stream-entry. It is so called because it arises in one who had, prior to the attainment of the path, practised with the determination, "I shall know what I have never known before in this beginningless <i>saṃsāra</i> — the deathless state (i.e., Nibbāna), or the four noble truths." The second is the faculty of wisdom in the six supramundane states from the fruition of stream-entry through the path of arahantship. And the third is the consummate knowledge of the four noble truths which arises in the arahant with the attainment of the final fruition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> (19) <i>Ujumagga:</i> the noble path leading directly to Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> (20) <i>Comy.</i>, gives two interpretations of this couplet: (1) first arises the knowledge of the path of arahantship, called "destruction" because it destroys all defilements; and immediately after there arises arahantship itself, here called "final' knowledge" (aññā); (2) first there arises the knowledge of the path of stream-entry, called "destruction" because it destroys the defilements coexisting with wrong views; and immediately afterwards there arises the faculty of final knowledge, which persists through the path of arahantship.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> (21) The arahant, endowed with the third faculty, delights in the peaceful state <i>(santipada),</i> Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> (22) According to the <i>Comy.</i>., beings identify one or the other of the five aggregates as the "self," and from that standpoint they proceed to speculate with regard to the three times: "Was I in the past?... Having been what, what did I become in the past?... What will I become in the future?" And in the present they think: "Where has this being come from, where will it go?" (M I 8, etc.)· The concept of a "self" of an "I," is the basic fallacy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> (23) He does not misconceive or imagine that there is a permanent self that speaks, acts, and exists in the three times. Through full understanding <i>(parinna)</i> he has realized phenomena to be impermanent, suffering, and not-self.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> (24) He takes his stand on Dhamma, on Nibbāna (the state of peace), which is timeless <i>(akāliko)</i> and stands outside the three periods of time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> (25) <i>Comy.</i>.: The arahant does not come to renewed being in any state of existence, and thus he no more enters into the range of concepts specifying his personal identity. He goes to the indescribable state, the unconditioned Nibbāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> (26) These verses and those of the following sutta appeared in Suttas 3 and 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> (27) There is a play on words here which is lost in translation: <i>moneyya,</i> translated as "perfection," is the state of a <i>muni,</i> a sage, a perfect or silent one, one who has <i>mona:</i> wisdom, self-possession, silence (the silencing of all imperfections). Thus <i>moneyya</i> is the silencing or stilling of activities <i>(kamma)</i> of body, speech, and mind, imperfections that lead to a future birth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> (28) By the development of virtue, concentration, and wisdom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> (29) "Supreme" here is <i>brahma,</i> which <i>Comy.</i>, explains as the best <i>(seṭṭha),</i> i.e., the fruit of arahantship. <i>Comy.</i>, also explains "Tathāgata," usually an exclusive epithet of the Buddha, in a way applicable to all arahants: like other arahants, so <i>(tathā)</i> this noble person has come along <i>(āgata)</i> endowed with excellent supporting conditions from the past and has gone <i>(gata)</i> to Nibbāna along the middle way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> (30) The symbolic meaning of these terms is explained in Sutta 10. In the case of bhikkhunīs (Buddhist nuns) "womenfolk" should be replaced by "menfolk." M 1460-62 offers a partly different interpretation of the metaphor.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> (31) This statement is an idiomatic phrase and is apparently a quotation from an unknown source describing one who has attained his goal. It is found elsewhere, e.g., at SN 35:197/S IV 175, as a designation for an arahant. See <i>Saṅyutta Nikāya Anthology,</i> Part I (BPS Wheel No. 107/ 109), p.67.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> (32) The King of Death <i>(maccurāja)</i> is a name for Māra. The arahant, by not being reborn, vanishes from Māra's sight; he steps outside Māra's domain so that the "Evil One" can neither locate nor define (delimit, measure, <i>pamāṇa</i>) him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> (33) The terms "recluse" and "brahmin" often occur together and denote those leading a life involved with religion. A recluse <i>(samaṇa)</i> is defined as anyone who has gone forth from the house life and in the Indian context could be called "a holy man." A brahmin is a priest who performs rituals and sacrifices and is usually a householder. The Buddha is sometimes called the "Great Recluse" <i>(mahāsamaṇa).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> (34) Renunciation <i>(nekkhamma)</i> refers here to the first absorption <i>(jhāna),</i> which is the entry into the form realm <i>(rūpā-vacara)</i> by leaving behind the realm of sensual desires <i>(kāmāvacara);</i> it is attained when the mind is "isolated" <i>(vivicca)</i> from sensual desires and other unwholesome states. The	"formless" <i>(ārūppa)</i>	is a formless-sphere meditative attainment. "Cessation" <i>(nirodha)</i> is Nibbāna. See Sutta 2 and note 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> (35) <i>Sabba-saṅkhāra-samatha:</i> the cessation of all conditioned things, of the whole of conditioned existence; this is Nibbāna, the unconditioned state.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> (37) The second and third verses are identical with those in Sutta 2, except for a slight variation in the first line of the second verse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> (38) These are the Five Precepts which, together with the Three Refuges, are the basic rules of conduct and belief for all Buddhists.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> (50) Contemplating foulness <i>(asubha)</i> is reflecting on the body in various ways so as to overcome physical attachment and sensual lust. The most common method is by mentally dissecting the body into its (traditional) thirty-two parts: head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, etc. The practice of the cemetery contemplations is also used. See Vism VI and VIII, 44-144.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> (51) The practice of <i>ānāpānasati,</i> or mindfulness of in-and-out breathing, is the most effective way to control the wandering thoughts that prevent the attainment of tranquillity and concentration.</p>

							<p class="f2">Negative words should be translated as negative words in Pali as they indicate the not-something of something where the English positive 'equivalent' is often the doing of something, thus causing such translations to point to the opposite of the intended meaning. Non ill-will is the not having of ill-will where friendliness is the having of friendly feelings. That is two different things!</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a>]</sup> (53) Or non-ill will <i>(avyāpāda).</i> In Pali, unlike English, negative words are actually synonyms of their positive counterparts. Thus "non-blindness" is a synonym for sight, "non-ill will" for friendliness or loving-kindness <i>(mettā),</i> "harmlessness" for compassion, etc. This makes it difficult to find exact equivalents for all these terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> (54) These three are called the three unwholesome roots <i>(akusala-mūlani)</i> in Sutta 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> (55) Devadatta was the Buddha's cousin who attempted to usurp his position as leader of the Saṅgha. According to the <i>Comy.</i>., because of pride in his attainments, Devadatta reasoned thus: "The Buddha is a Sakyan, I too am a Sakyan; the Buddha is a recluse, I too am a recluse; the Buddha possesses supernormal powers <i>(iddhi),</i> I too possess supernormal powers;... I will be a Buddha and take care of the Order of bhikkhus." When this bid failed he attempted to create a schism within the Saṅgha and plotted to have the Buddha murdered. See Bhikkhu Nanamoli, <i>The Life of the Buddha,</i> pp.258<i>ff.</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> (56) The "trifling attainment" refers to Devadatta's acquisition of supernormal powers, which led to his downfall.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> (62) Each of the four kinds of noble disciple is considered as either being on the path <i>(magga)</i> or as having attained the fruit <i>(phala)</i> of that path; thus there are four pairs or eight individuals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> (63) <i>Piṇḍolya</i> (lit., food-balls or lumps) means the almsfood a bhikkhu collects from house to house.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> (64) This verse appears also in Sutta 21. The Burmese-script edition includes here also the preceding verse of Sutta 21, though the PTS edition, which I follow, excludes it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> (65) <i>Nibbuto:</i> quenched or cooled. One who has extinguished the three fires of lust, hate, and delusion (see Sutta 44) has attained Nibbāna, the state of extinction or being "quenched."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> (70) Penetration <i>(nibbedha)</i> is the direct understanding of the four noble truths. See the verse in Sutta 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> (71) In the <i>Uddesavibhariga Sutta</i> (<a href="../../../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/mn/idx_majjhima_nikaya_3.htm#p138">MN 138</a>) this highly compressed statement by the Buddha is explained by the Venerable Mahākaccāna and forms the subject matter of that sutta. Briefly, "externally not distracted" means guarding the senses so that the mind is not overwhelmed and carried away by the variety and details of sights, sounds, etc., that impinge on the senses. "Internally not fixed" is not being fascinated by the rapture and joy, etc., experienced in the <i>jhānas.</i> Such fascination is a subtle form of craving which leads to grasping, being, birth, and so forth, that is, to the whole process of future suffering and the perpetuation of <i>saṃsāra.</i> Investigating (examining, probing) these experiences is the practice of insight meditation <i>(vipassanā-bhāvana).</i></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> (72) The seven ties <i>(saṅgā)</i> are: craving, views, conceit, anger, ignorance, defilement, and misconduct. The "cord" is the cord of being <i>(bhavanetti),</i> i.e., craving for being. See The Twos, note 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> (73) Humans and most devas are surrounded by objects that can become objects of desire — this is the first way. The second and third refer to two classes of devas in the world of sense <i>(kāma-dhatu):</i> the <i>nimmānarati-devas</i> ("those delighting in their own creations") and the <i>paranimmita-vasavatti-devas</i> ("those who control what others have created"). The verse also mentions "others who enjoy sense objects"; according to <i>Comy.</i>., this refers to some beings in the subhuman realms of existence, such as animals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n146" href="#fn146">146</a>]</sup> (74) PTS ed. omits this line and the next (saṃsāraṃ nātivattare etam ādīnavaṃ ñatvā). The translation follows the Burmese edition.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> (75) Though pleasurable, sensual pleasures are bound up with danger <i>(ādīnava)</i> in that they are impermanent and never fully satisfying. Thus they lead to frustration and to the perpetuation of the "round." The "danger" in them is to be seen as the noble truth of suffering.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n148" href="#fn148">148</a>]</sup> (76) The bond of sensual desire is what holds living beings to the sense-sphere realm <i>(kāma-dhatu),</i> the bond of (desire for) being is what holds them to <i>saṃsāra.</i> All those from the worldling through the once-returner <i>(sakadāgāmī)</i> are still bound by both bonds; the non-returner <i>(anāgamī)</i> has eradicated the sensual bond but not the desire for being; the arahant has eradicated both bonds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> (80) <i>Comy.</i>, explains that the first verse refers to the giving of material things; the second — by the mentioning of "proclaiming" and "hearing" — refers to the gift of the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n153" href="#fn153">153</a>]</sup> (81) <i>Lapitalāpana.</i> The Buddha is referring pejoratively to the brahmins' practice of reciting from the Vedic scriptures. The threefold knowledge <i>(tevijjā)</i> traditionally meant knowledge of the three Vedas, but the Buddha redefined this from the standpoint of the Dhamma as the knowledge leading to enlightenment and release from the round of births. The idea of persuasive talk or "patter" is a beggar's ploy to cajole people into giving alms.</p>
					
					<p><b>Fours</b></p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n154" href="#fn154">154</a>]</sup> (1) Accessible to entreaties <i>(yācayoga),</i> that is, always ready to teach the Dhamma when asked; and open-handed <i>(payatapāṇi),</i> being in constant readiness to give a gift, here the gift of the Dhamma, in the appropriate manner.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n155" href="#fn155">155</a>]</sup> (2) The Buddha is called "the great physician" as he offers the treatment to cure the suffering inherent in the round of birth and death. And he is a surgeon <i>(sallakantta)</i> who has the method for excising the poisoned arrows <i>(sallan)</i> of lust, hate, and delusion embedded in the minds of beings.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n156" href="#fn156">156</a>]</sup> (3) This is the Buddha's variation on the brahmins' claim to be born from the mouth of the god Brahmā.</p>
