					<h1>One Fortunate Attachment</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the Pāḷi by Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera<br />
					from <b><i>A Treasury of the Buddha's Words</i></b><br />
					edited and arranged by Phra Khantipalo<br />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>There are four consecutive suttas in the <b><i>Majjhima Nikaya</i></b> with the name <i>Bhaddekaratta,</i> each based on the same verse.</p>

					<p class="f4">The term has been translated "The Saint" and like phrases, which however, quite miss the point.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Commentary says only this: <i>"'Bhaddekaratassa'</i> means 'of one who is fortunate <i>(bhadda)</i> in having one (eka) attachment (<i>ratta</i> or <i>ratti</i>)'; this is because of his possessing application to insight." The Sub-commentary resolves the compound <i>ekaratta</i> (one-attachment) into <i>eka ratti,</i> and says only that "<i>'Bhaddekaratta'</i> means one who has a fortunate single attachment <i>(bhaddo ekaratto etassa),</i> and it is a term for a person who is cultivating insight."</p>

					<p class="f4">The <b><i>Mahà-Niddesa</i></b> (commentary on <b><i>Sutta Nipata</i></b> verse 964) alludes to these suttas without throwing any light on them. There appears to be no other mention of the term elsewhere in the Canon and its Commentaries.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Pāḷi word <i>ratta</i> (adj) or <i>ratti</i> (s) in this instance is from the root <i>raj</i> (<i>rañjati, rajjati</i> — "to take pleasure in" — e.g. <i>ettha me rañjati mano —</i> "here my mind delights", <b><i>Sutta Nipata</i></b> verse 424). So <i>"Bhaddekaratta"</i> appears as one who is applying himself invincibly, unshakeably, to <i>know and study the present state as it occurs</i> (see, verse). This application or <i>attachment</i> is <i>auspicious</i> or <i>fortunate</i> because it leads to deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The much commoner meaning of the Pāḷi word <i>ratti</i> is "night" (Skt. <i>rātra</i>). But (and neither the Commentary nor Sub-commentary decides the point) if we attempt to interpret the Sutta term "Bhaddekatta" as "one who has a single auspicious night" (and the commentarial passages accordingly, which is grammatically possible), it is hard to make satisfactory sense of the context. It might be supposed that the expression <i>Bhaddekaratta</i> was a popular phrase taken over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not infrequently done, but there seems no reason to do so in this case and there is no evidence for it. It is more likely to be a term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of development. Other such terms are <i>ukkhitapaligha</i> (one who has lifted the bar — M 22), <i>ditthipatta</i> (one who has attained vision — M. 70), and many more.</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in Jeta's Grove,<br />
					Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

					<p class="f4">There he addressed the <i>bhikkhus</i> thus:<br />
					<i>"Bhikkhus."</i></p>

					<p class="f4">"Venerable sir,"<br />
					they replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>2.</b> "<i>Bhikkhus,</i> I shall give you a summary and an exposition of him who has one fortunate attachment.<sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></p>

					<p class="f4">Listen and heed well what I shall say."</p>

					<p class="f4">"Even so, venerable sir,"<br />
					the <i>bhikkhus</i> replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One said this:<sup>[<a id="edfn1" href="#edn1">ed1</a>]</sup></p>

							<p class="f4 in2"><b>3.</b><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> Let not a man revive the past<br />
							Or on the future build his hopes;<br />
							The past is ... as the left-behind,<br />
							The future ... as the yet-unreached.<br />
							Rather with insight let him see<br />
							Each <i>dhamma</i> presently arisen:<br />
							To know and to be sure of that.</p>

							<p class="f4 in2">Today the effort must be made:<br />
							Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?<br />

							'Tis he, the Hermit Stilled, has said,<br />
							That has one Fortunate Attachment.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>4.</b> And how does he revive the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking)<br />
					'I had such form<sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup> in the past',<br />
					he allows (himself) to relish<sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup> that.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking)<br />
					'I had such feeling in the past',<br />
					he allows himself to relish that.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking)<br />
					'I had such perception in the past',<br />

					'I had such consciousness in the past',<br />
					he allows himself to relish that.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he revives the past.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>5.</b> And how does he not revive the past?</p>

					<p class="f4">(Thinking)</p>

					<p class="f4">'I had such form in the past',<br />
					he does not allow himself to relish that...<br />

					<p class="f4">(Thinking)<br />
					'I had such consciousness in the past',<br />
					he does not allow himself to relish that.</p>

					<p class="f4">That is how he does not revive the past.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>6.</b> And how does he build up hope upon the future?</p>

					'I may have such form in the future',<br />

					<p class="f4"><b>8.</b> And how is he vanquished in regard to presently arisen <i>dhammas?</i></p>
