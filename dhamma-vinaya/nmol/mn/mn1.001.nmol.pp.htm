					<hr class="demi">

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> §2. According to the comy.: the rendering could be 'a discourse on the root of all ideas', and no connection is made between the word Sabba (all) in Sabba Dhamma and sabba in §26, which has a special emphasis in sutta 49. cf. syntax of sutta 2, §2.<br />
					For dhamma as 'idea' see introduction.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> §3f. The following scheme shows the differences between the four kinds of Persons.<br />
					The Ordinary man (Pothujjana) has a percept (sañjānati) conceives (that to be) (maññati) has not fully diagnosed (apariññātaɱ)<br />
					The Initiate (Sekha) has direct knowledge (abhijānāti) ought not to conceive (māmaññati) ought to fully diagnose (pariññeyya)<br />
					The Arahant (Arahant) " does not conceive (namaññati) has fully diagnosed (pariññāyaɱ)<br />
					The Perfect One (Tathāgata) has fully diagnosed to the end (pariññātantaɱ) </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> §4. Paṭhaviɱ pathavito sañjānāti – from earth he has a percept of earth': This presents the first of the many problems, most of which seems to be ontological. This ablative construction would normally be freely renderable by 'he perceives earth as earth' (ie. perceives it 'for what it really is'); but that takes the ablative in a different sense to the one that follows (pathavito maññati – he conceives (that to be apart) from earth), which seems hard to justify, and perhaps not necessary. The strongest argument against this is that 'perceives' (sañjānāti) is used only of the ordinary man. Consequently it must be taken that in the act of perceiving a basic slight distortion takes place (cf. definition of saññā = perception in Vis: ch 14 and abhinivesa = interpretation), which is absent in abhiññā = direct-knowledge. The perceiving has already made an interpretation from the bare object of viññāṇa (bahiddhāyatana). Perceiving has the utraquistic sense of the act of perceiving and the percept, and that is deliberately implied here, apparently.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">'Maññati – Conceives': whatever the etymology maññati is semantically inseparable from māna (conceit) as well as manati (to measure) for other contexts see 'Yena yena hi maññati tato taɱ hoti aññathā' (M. sutta __), maññussava (M. sutta 140,§§25-6), Yena kho āvuso lokasmiɱ lokasaññi hoti lokamāni ayaɱ vuccati ariyassa vinaye loko. kena c'āvuso lokasmiɱ lokasaññi hoti lokamāni? cakkhunā… (s. vol.4, 95=xxxv,116 – This closely concerns the present sutta), and 'cakkhuɱ na maññeyya, cakkhusmiɱ na maññeyya, cakkhuto na maññeyya, cakkhu 'me' ti na maññeyya; rūpe na maññeyya… (etc. with the 4 modes up to vedanā) …sabbaɱ na maññeyya. so evam amaññamāne na kinci loke upādiyati… (s. vol.IV, 65=xxxv,90) See Vbh 355-6 and s.III,130 as to §29, etc. The prohibitive mā maññati can only signify that, in The Initiates case, he can, but ought not to, indulge in conceiving: he can still do so because he still has asmimanā, which is only eliminated by Arahantship. This should show that, in spite of what the commentary says, the fourfold sakkāyadi??hi of sutta 44, is not directly connectable; for a sekha does not have sakkāyadi??hi at all.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">In rendering the 4 maññati phrases, the first difficulty is the use of the transitive maññati with no object except in the first phrase (pathaviɱ maññati) (The same difficulty arises in sutta 49 where nāpahosiɱ is substituted for na maññati). The commentary suggests a rendering such 'he conceives (self as) earth, he conceives (self as) in earth, he conceives (self as) apart from earth, he conceives earth as 'Mine',…, and it attempts an equation with the 4 modes of the sakkāyadi??hi given for each of the 5 aggregates in sutta 44, §7). But this is perhaps rather procrustean. It may do for the ordinary man, who has sakkāyadi??hi (embodiment view – see sutta 44), but that is abandoned by the Initiate, who, however still has asmi-māna (the conceit I am), which is only abandoned by the arahant. He shall secure of 'being' with 'being self'. In sutta 44 the modes in which ideas of self (attā) already clearly formed are treatable is handled; but in the present sutta (and in sutta 49) the treatment is on a more general level and there is no specific mention of attā – The conceiving is simply done on the basis of the percept. Attā is no doubt implied here but not yet explicitly stated. Since, however, a subject is necessary in the rendering the only safe one seems to be one drawn from the sutta itself without introducing outside ideas, namely, the percept (also it makes sense not only here but throughout).</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">The conceiving can also be taken as showing the grammatical behaviour of the mind towards what it has (mis-)perceived: it conceives its earth-percept in the accusative, locative, or ablative relation, or as a possession (or as an object to take interest, positive or negative in).</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">But the most important aspect of this structure is the ontological one. The general question of ontology as desirable from the suttas is dealt with in the introduction. How it is relevant in this sutta appears more clearly from the use of nāpahosiɱ in sutta 49 instead of namaññati; for it indicates that one of the functions of maññanā is to endow percepts with being.</p>
					
					<p class="lgqt">When compressed, the commentary's explanation is: the ordinary man perceives with some degree of error by taking 'earth' according to common usage. On the basis of that he then first of all conceives 'earth' with the habitual diversification (papañca) effected by craving, conceit and view, taking it as respectively, 'I am earth' or 'my earth' or 'another's earth', or another's earth; or else he respectively likes the object, has the conceit that it is better or worse than another, and equates it with or differentiates it from, the soul. Next he 'conceives' that he, or another, is 'in earth', or 'there is the impediment of owning in earth', or else he conceives that his self is 'in earth'. Next he 'conceives' that his or another's self is different 'from earth'. Lastly he 'conceives' earth as 'Mine' simply out of craving.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> §8. bhūte bhūtato sañjānāti…bhūtate maññati: The use of the ablative suffix -to in a plural sense is unusual, but it cannot be taken in other way. Such a rendering as 'recognizes the beings from nature (ie. from the fact of being nature)' (P.T.S. Dict. under bhūto) is quite untenable. This emphasises the use of the ablative in -to rather than the more usual -ā, -amhā, -asmā (plu.-ehi), and seems a further indication in favour of the view that the two occurrences in each clause – here bhūto sañjānāti…bhūtato maññati have the same significance (ie. 'from'?) rather than 'as' in the first case and 'apart from' in the second for abhiññeyyatā &amp; pariññeyyatā see Vbh. 426 and Vbh. A. 522.,<br />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> §28. For 'Sekha-Initiate' see sutta 53. The term (lit. one still with training to do) applies to the first seven of the 'Eight Persons'. They have all no sakkāyadiṭṭhi but still have asmi–māna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> §29. NB 'abhijānāti-has direct knowledge' instead of 'sañjānāti-has perception of'.<br />
					'Mā-maññi-cannot conceive': the form is the normal negative imperative or prohibitive. cf. Another unusual use of the 'mā' construction of sutta 65, §27.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> §154. reading pariññātantaɱ (fully diagnosed to the end) with comy., etc.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> §155. emphasises the ontological aspect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> §203. So all editions, apparently except the P.T.S. edition.</p>

					<p class="f4">He perceives earth as (or from) earth, Having perceived earth as earth, he conceives (self or himself) to be earth, he conceives (self or himself) to be in earth, he conceives (self or himself) to be apart from earth, he conceives earth as 'Mine', he delights, in earth. (This introduction of 'self' (attā) is not justified in view of the sekha section).</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He perceives earth from (or as) earth, having perceived earth from (or as earth, he conceives earth (as such), he conceives earth as inclusive, he conceives earth as exclusive, he conceives earth as his possession, he conceives himself with earth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">He perceives earth as (or from) earth, having perceived earth as (or from) earth, he conceives (the concept ) 'earth', he conceives (the concept) 'in earth', he conceives (the concept) 'from earth', he conceives earth as 'mine', he delights in earth.</p>
