Exposition of Kamma-1
Introduction
You want: long life, health, beauty, power, riches, high birth, wisdom?
Or even some of these things? They do not appear by chance. It is
not someone's luck that they are healthy, or another's lack of it that he
is stupid. Though it may not be clear to us now, all such inequalities
among human beings (and all sorts of beings) come about because of the
kamma they have made individually. Each person reaps his own fruits.
So if one is touched by short life, sickliness, ugliness, insignificance,
poverty, low birth or stupidity and one does not like these things, no
need to just accept that that is the way it is. The future need not be
like that provided that you make the right kind of kamma now. Knowing
what kamma to make and what not to make is the mark ofa wise
man. It is also the mark of one who is no longer drifting aimlessly
but has some direction in life and some control over the sort of events
that will occur.
The Sutta (135)
1. Thus I heard:
On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Savatthi in Jeta’s
Grove, Anathapindika’s Park.
Then Subha the student (divine), Todeyya’s son, went to the Blessed
One and exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and
amiabie talk was finished, he sat down at one side. When he had done
so, Subha the student (divine) said to the Blessed One:
72 Buddhists—Lay People
2. "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, why inferiority
and superiority are met with among human beings, among
mankind? For one meets with short-lived and long-lived men, sick and
handsome men, insignificant and influential men, poor and rich men,
low-born and high-born men, stupid and wise men. What is the reason,
what is the condition, why inferiority and superiority are met with
among human beings, among mankind ? '
3. ‘Student (divine), beings are owners of kammas, heirs of kammas,
they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin (responsibility),
kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate
beings according to inferiority and superiority.’
4. ‘I do not understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotams’s utterance
spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning. It would
be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand
the detailed meaning of Master Gotama’s utterence spoken in
brief without expounding the detailed meaning.’
‘Then listen, student (divine), and heed well what I shall say.’
‘Even so, Master,’ Subha the student (divine) replied. The Blessed One
said this:
5. ‘Here, student (divine), some woman or man isa killer of living
beings, murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless
to all living beings. Due to having performed and completed such kammas,
on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state
of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell. If, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, instead of his reappearing in a
State of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, in hell, he
comes to the human state, he is short-lived wherever he is reborn. This
is the way that leads to short life, that is to say, to bea killer of living
beings, murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows and violence, merciless
to all living beings.
6. But here some woman or man, having abandoned the’killing of living
beings, abstains from killing living beings, lays aside the rod and lays
aside the knife, is considerate and merciful and dwells compassionate
for the welfare of all living beings. Due to having performed and completed
such kammas, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reap

pears in a happy destination in the heavenly world. If, on the dissolution
of the body, after death, instead of hisreappearing in a happy destination,
in the heavenly world, he comes to the human state, he is longlived
wherever he is reborn. This is the way that leads to long life,
that is to say, to have abandoned the killing of living beings, to abstain

with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives. Due to
having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of the
body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation... If... instead
... he comes to the human state, he is sickly wherever he is born.
This is the way that leads to sickliness, thatis to say, to bea persecutor
of beings with one's hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives.
8. ‘But here some woman or man is not a persecutor of beings with his
hands, or with clods, or with sticks, or with knives. Due to having

reappears in a state of deprivation... If... instead... he comes to

21. When that was said, Subha the student (divine), Todeyya’s son,
said to the Blessed One: ‘Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master
Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Mas


ter Gotama, as though he were righting the overthrown, revealing the
hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, holding up a lamp in the
darkness for those with eyes to see forms.
22. ‘I go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma and to the
Sangha. From today let Master Gotama accept me as a follower who
has gone to him for refuge for life.’

para. 5. etc. (see also Sutta 136) ‘Due to having performed and completed'
