					<h1>Voidness 1</h1>

					<p class="ctr">Translated from the Pāḷi by Venerable Ñāṇamoli Thera<br />
					from <b><i>A Treasury of the Buddha's Words</i></b><br />

					<h4>Translator's Introduction</h4>

					<p>The meaning of voidness <i>(suññata)</i> is very precisely defined by the Buddha in this Sutta. We are told, step by step, "exactly what is void and what, still remaining, has to be recognized as not void. And we begin in this world of the senses which we know fairly well. Then by stages we withdraw to the forest, from that to the earth and using that as a <i>kasina,</i> a base for concentration, arrive after long efforts maybe, at the base of infinite space. All that has gone before, all experience while in that concentration, is of infinite space. Now, one who does not have a good Teacher might stop here imagining that he had arrived at voidness and perhaps mistake it for <i>Nibbāna.</i> But he has to push on through the other three formless concentrations until he attains to the signiess concentration of mind in which there is no discrimination of "marks" or "signs". This has to be seen as a conditioned state, impermanent and liable to cessation. Having seen this, he is free from birth and death, free from ignorance, an Arahant.</p>

					<p class="f4">On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthi in the Eastern Park,<br />
					the Palace of Migāra's Mother.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>2.</b> Then when it was evening,<br />
					the venerable Ānanda rose from retreat,<br />
					and he went to the Blessed One,<br />
					and after paying homage to him,<br />
					he sat down at one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had done so,<br />
					he said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>3.</b> "Venerable sir,<br />
					once the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country.</p>

					<p class="f4">There is a town of the Sakyans called Nāgaraka;<br />
					there I heard and learnt this from the Blessed One's own lips:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now I abide much in the void abiding, Ānanda.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Venerable sir,<br />
					was this well heard by me,<br />
					well apprehended,<br />
					well attended to and well remembered?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Certainly, Ānanda,<br />
					that was well heard by you,<br />
					well apprehended,<br />
					well attended to and well remembered.</p>

					<p class="f4">As formerly,<br />
					so now too,<br />
					I abide much in the void abiding.</p>

					<p class="f4"><b>4.</b><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup> "Ānanda, just as the Palace of Migāra's Mother is void of elephants,<br />
					cattle,<br />
					horses and mares,<br />
					void of gold and silver,<br />
					void of the foregathering of women and men,<br />
					and there is only this non-voidness,<br />
					that is to say,<br />
					the single state of non-voidness dependent on the presence of the community of <i>bhikkhus,</i><br />
					so too,<br />
					without giving attention to perception of village,<br />
					without giving attention to perception of man,<br />
					a <i>bhikkhu</i> gives attention to the single state of non-voidness dependent on the presence of perception of forest.</p>

					<p class="f4">His mind enters into that perception of forest and acquires confidence,<br />
					steadiness and decision.</p>

					<p class="f4">He understands thus:</p>
