					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: "Mendicants!" "Venerable sir," they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to complete the procedure, and to realize extinguishment.</p>

					<p class="f4">What four? It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. Observing the Body</p>

					<p class="f4">1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body? It's when a mendicant—gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut—sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.</p>

					<p class="f4">When breathing in heavily they know: 'I'm breathing in heavily.' When breathing out heavily they know: 'I'm breathing out heavily.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When breathing in lightly they know: 'I'm breathing in lightly.' When breathing out lightly they know: 'I'm breathing out lightly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.</p>

					<p class="f4">They practice breathing in stilling the body's motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body's motion.</p>

					<p class="f4">It's like an expert carpenter or carpenters apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: 'I'm making a deep cut,' and when making a shallow cut they know: 'I'm making a shallow cut.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That's how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">1.2. The Postures</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: 'I am walking.' When standing they know: 'I am standing.' When sitting they know: 'I am sitting.' And when lying down they know: 'I am lying down.' Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">1.3. Situational Awareness</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally ... That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. 'In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It's as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: 'These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally ... That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">1.5. Focusing on the Elements</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: 'In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.'</p>

					<p class="f4">It's as if an expert butcher or butcher's apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally ... That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They'd compare it with their own body: 'This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.' And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally ... That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They'd compare it with their own body: 'This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.' And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally ... That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse thrown in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews ...</p>

					<p class="f4">A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews ...</p>

					<p class="f4">A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Bones without sinews, scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull ...</p>

					<p class="f4">White bones, the color of shells ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile ...</p>

					<p class="f4">Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They'd compare it with their own body: 'This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.' And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Observing the Feelings</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings? It's when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: 'I feel a pleasant feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a painful feeling, they know: 'I feel a painful feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: 'I feel a neutral feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a carnal pleasant feeling, they know: 'I feel a carnal pleasant feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a spiritual pleasant feeling, they know: 'I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a carnal painful feeling, they know: 'I feel a carnal painful feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a spiritual painful feeling, they know: 'I feel a spiritual painful feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a carnal neutral feeling, they know: 'I feel a carnal neutral feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they feel a spiritual neutral feeling, they know: 'I feel a spiritual neutral feeling.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing feelings as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that feelings exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That's how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Observing the Mind</p>

					<p class="f4">And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?</p>

					<p class="f4">It's when a mendicant knows mind with greed as 'mind with greed,' and mind without greed as 'mind without greed.' They know mind with hate as 'mind with hate,' and mind without hate as 'mind without hate.' They know mind with delusion as 'mind with delusion,' and mind without delusion as 'mind without delusion.' They know contracted mind as 'contracted mind,' and scattered mind as 'scattered mind.' They know expansive mind as 'expansive mind,' and unexpansive mind as 'unexpansive mind.' They know mind that is not supreme as 'mind that is not supreme,' and mind that is supreme as 'mind that is supreme.' They know mind immersed in meditation as 'mind immersed in meditation,' and mind not immersed in meditation as 'mind not immersed in meditation.' They know freed mind as 'freed mind,' and unfreed mind as 'unfreed mind.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the mind as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the mind exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That's how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">The first recitation section is finished.</p>

					<p class="f4">4.5.1. The Truth of Suffering</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is the noble truth of suffering? Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is 'not getting what you wish for is suffering'? In sentient beings who are liable to be reborn, such a wish arises: 'Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!' But you can't get that by wishing. This is 'not getting what you wish for is suffering.' In sentient beings who are liable to grow old ... fall ill ... die ... experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, such a wish arises: 'Oh, if only we were not liable to experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress! If only sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress would not come to us!' But you can't get that by wishing. This is 'not getting what you wish for is suffering.'</p>

It's the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">But where does that craving arise and where does it settle? Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

							<p>The Pali: <i>Katamo ca bhikkhave sammā-saɱkappo?</i>|| ||</p>

							<p class="f4"><i>Nekkhamma-saɱkappo, avyāpāda-saɱkappo, avihiɱsā-saɱkappo,||<br />
							ayaɱ vuccati bhikkhave sammā-saɱkappo.</i></p>
							
							<p>NOTE: <i>avyāpāda</i> not-via-the not-path, (or, more conventionally translated, non-harm): Not 'love'!;<br />
							<i>avihiɱsā</i> not-violence: Not 'kindness'!<br />
							There is a place for these, but it is not here, and this is to take the Pali and completely reverse the intent from that of abstaining from a bad thing to aspiring to a good thing. This is contra-method! You must try to understand this distinction! There is no ending kamma or rebirth by 'doing'. These things are good to do, make good kamma; but they do not end kamma. Rhys Davids makes the same mistake. Warren, Walsh, Bhk. Thanissaro, and myself have it correctly. This is a good exmple of the way bias towards activism in the world distorts the method for accomplishing what the Buddha actually taught.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is right livelihood? It's when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. This is called right livelihood.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is right effort? It's when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don't arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. This is called right effort.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is right mindfulness? It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles—keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. This is called right mindfulness.</p>

					<p class="f4">And what is right immersion? It's when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion. This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.</p>

					<p class="f4">And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world. That's how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.</p>

					<p class="f4">Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there's something left over, non-return.</p>

					<p class="f4">Let alone seven years, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for six years ... five years ... four years ... three years ... two years ... one year ... seven months ...</p>

					<p class="f4">six months ... five months ... four months ... three months ... two months ... one month ... a fortnight ... Let alone a fortnight, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there's something left over, non-return.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to complete the procedure, and to realize extinguishment.' That's what I said, and this is why I said it."</p>

					<p class="f4">That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
