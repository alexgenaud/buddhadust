					<p class="f4">So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Mallas together with a large Saṅgha of five hundred mendicants when he arrived at a Mallian town named Pāvā. There he stayed in Cunda the smith's mango grove.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka had recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It had not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. The Mallas of Pāvā also heard that the Buddha had arrived and was staying in Cunda's mango grove. Then they went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Sir, a new town hall named Ubbhaṭaka has recently been constructed for the Mallas of Pāvā. It has not yet been occupied by an ascetic or brahmin or any person at all. May the Buddha be the first to use it, and only then will the Mallas of Pāvā use it. That would be for the lasting welfare and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā." The Buddha consented in silence.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then, knowing that the Buddha had accepted, the Mallas got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right. Then they went to the new town hall, where they spread carpets all over, prepared seats, set up a water jar, and placed a lamp. Then they went back to the Buddha, bowed, stood to one side, and told him of their preparations, saying: "Please, sir, come at your convenience."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Buddha robed up and, taking his bowl and robe, went to the new town hall together with the Saṅgha of mendicants. Having washed his feet he entered the town hall and sat against the central column facing east. The Saṅgha of mendicants also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the west wall facing east, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Mallas of Pāvā also washed their feet, entered the town hall, and sat against the east wall facing west, with the Buddha right in front of them. The Buddha spent most of the night educating, encouraging, firing up, and inspiring the Mallas with a Dhamma talk. Then he dismissed them: "The night is getting late, Vāseṭṭhas. Please go at your convenience." "Yes, sir," replied the Mallas. They got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Soon after they left, the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed Venerable Sāriputta: "Sāriputta, the Saṅgha of mendicants is rid of dullness and drowsiness. Give them some Dhamma talk as you feel inspired. My back is sore, I'll stretch it." "Yes, sir," Sāriputta replied.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And then the Buddha spread out his outer robe folded in four and laid down in the lion's posture — on the right side, placing one foot on top of the other — mindful and aware, and focused on the time of getting up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta had recently passed away at Pāvā. With his passing the Jain ascetics split, dividing into two factions, arguing, quarreling, and fighting, continually wounding each other with barbed words: "You don't understand this teaching and training. I understand this teaching and training. What, you understand this teaching and training? You're practicing wrong. I'm practicing right. I stay on topic, you don't. You said last what you should have said first. You said first what you should have said last. What you've thought so much about has been disproved. Your doctrine is refuted. Go on, save your doctrine! You're trapped; get yourself out of this — if you can!" You'd think there was nothing but slaughter going on among the Jain ascetics. And the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta's white-clothed lay disciples were disillusioned, dismayed, and disappointed in the Jain ascetics. They were equally disappointed with a teaching and training so poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha, with broken monument and without a refuge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then Sāriputta told the mendicants about these things. He went on to say: "That's what happens, reverends, when a teaching and training is poorly explained and poorly propounded, not emancipating, not leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is not a fully awakened Buddha. But this teaching is well explained and well propounded to us by the Blessed One, emancipating, leading to peace, proclaimed by someone who is a fully awakened Buddha. You should all recite this in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is that teaching?</p>

					<h4>1. Ones</h4>

'All sentient beings are sustained by food.' 'All sentient beings are sustained by conditions.' These are the teachings grouped by one that have been rightly explained by the Blessed One, who knows and sees, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha.

					<h4>4. Fours</h4>

					<p class="f4">There are teachings grouped by four that have been rightly explained by the Buddha. You should all recite these in concert. What are the teachings grouped by four?</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four kinds of mindfulness meditation. It's when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings ... mind ... principles — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four right efforts. A mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don't arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four bases of psychic power. A mendicant develops the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to enthusiasm, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to mental development, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to energy, and active effort. They develop the basis of psychic power that has immersion due to inquiry, and active effort.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four absorptions. A mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four ways of developing immersion further. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness. There is a way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life? It's when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption ... second absorption ... fourth absorption. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to blissful meditation in the present life.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision? A mendicant focuses on the perception of light, concentrating on the perception of day regardless of whether it is night or day. And so, with an open and unenveloped heart, they develop a mind that's full of radiance. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to gaining knowledge and vision.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness? A mendicant knows feelings as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know perceptions as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. They know thoughts as they arise, as they remain, and as they go away. This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to mindfulness and awareness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">An what is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements? A mendicant meditates observing rise and fall in the five grasping aggregates. 'Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such are feelings ... perceptions ... choices ... consciousness, such is the origin of consciousness, such is the ending of consciousness.' This is the way of developing immersion further that leads to the ending of defilements.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four immeasurables. A mendicant meditates spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of love to the whole world — abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. They meditate spreading a heart full of compassion ... rejoicing ... equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, they spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world — abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four formless states. A mendicant, going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', enters and remains in the dimension of infinite space. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite consciousness, aware that 'there is nothing at all', they enter and remain in the dimension of nothingness. Going totally beyond the dimension of nothingness, they enter and remain in the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four supports. After reflection, a mendicant uses some things, endures some things, avoids some things, and gets rid of some things.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four noble traditions. A mendicant is content with any kind of robe, and praises such contentment. They don't try to get hold of a robe in an improper way. They don't get upset if they don't get a robe. And if they do get a robe, they use it untied, unstupefied, unattached, seeing the drawback, and understanding the escape. And on account of that they don't glorify themselves or put others down. A mendicant who is expert, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, original noble tradition.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of alms-food ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant is content with any kind of lodgings ...</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant enjoys giving up and loves to give up. They enjoy meditation and love to meditate. But they don't glorify themselves or put down others on account of their love for giving up and meditation. A mendicant who is expert, tireless, aware, and mindful in this is said to stand in the ancient, original noble tradition.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four efforts. The efforts to restrain, to give up, to develop, and to preserve. And what is the effort to restrain? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they don't get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears ... When they smell an odor with their nose ... When they taste a flavor with their tongue ... When they feel a touch with their body ... When they know a thought with their mind, they don't get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of mind were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of mind, and achieving its restraint. This is called the effort to restrain.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the effort to give up? It's when a mendicant doesn't tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and exterminates it. They don't tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. This is called the effort to give up.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the effort to develop? It's when a mendicant develops the awakening factors of mindfulness, investigation of principles, energy, rapture, tranquility, immersion, and equanimity, which rely on seclusion, fading away, and cessation, and ripen as letting go. This is called the effort to develop.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And what is the effort to preserve? It's when a mendicant preserves a meditation subject that's a fine basis of immersion: the perception of a skeleton, a worm-infested corpse, a livid corpse, a split open corpse, or a bloated corpse. This is called the effort to preserve.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four knowledges: knowledge of the present phenomena, knowledge of what follows, knowledge of others' minds, and conventional knowledge.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Another four knowledges: knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four factors of stream-entry: associating with good people, listening to the true teaching, proper attention, and practicing in line with the teaching.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four factors of a stream-enterer. A noble disciple has experiential confidence in the Buddha: 'That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.' They have experiential confidence in the teaching: 'The teaching is well explained by the Buddha — realizable in this very life, immediately effective, inviting inspection, relevant, so that sensible people can know it for themselves.' They have experiential confidence in the Saṅgha: 'The Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples is practicing the way that's good, straightforward, methodical, and proper. It consists of the four pairs, the eight individuals. This is the Saṅgha of the Buddha's disciples that is worthy of offerings dedicated to the gods, worthy of hospitality, worthy of a teacher's offering, worthy of greeting with joined palms, and is the supreme field of merit for the world.' And a noble disciple's ethical conduct is loved by the noble ones, uncorrupted, unflawed, unblemished, untainted, liberating, praised by sensible people, not mistaken, and leading to immersion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four fruits of the ascetic life: stream-entry, once-return, non-return, and perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four elements: earth, water, fire, and air.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four foods: solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four bases for consciousness to remain. As long as consciousness remains, it remains involved with form, supported by form, founded on form. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it grows, increases, and matures. Or consciousness remains involved with feeling ... Or consciousness remains involved with perception ... Or as long as consciousness remains, it remains involved with choices, supported by choices, grounded on choices. And with a sprinkle of relishing, it grows, increases, and matures.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four prejudices: making decisions prejudiced by favoritism, hostility, stupidity, and cowardice.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four things that give rise to craving. Craving arises in a mendicant for the sake of robes, alms-food, lodgings, or rebirth in this or that state.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Four ways of practice: painful practice with slow insight, painful practice with swift insight, pleasant practice with slow insight, and pleasant practice with swift insight.</p>

Being joyful, rapture springs up. When the mind is full of rapture, the body becomes tranquil. When the body is tranquil, one feels bliss. And when blissful, the mind becomes immersed. This is the first opportunity for freedom.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, it may be that neither the Teacher nor a respected spiritual companion teaches Dhamma to a mendicant. But the mendicant teaches Dhamma in detail to others as they learned and memorized it. ... Or the mendicant recites the teaching in detail as they learned and memorized it. ...

					<h4>8. Eights</h4>

					<p class="f4">There are teachings grouped by eight that have been rightly explained by the Buddha. You should all recite these in concert. What are the teachings grouped by eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">Eight wrong ways: wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, and wrong immersion.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight right ways: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>

The perfected one, and the one practicing for perfection.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight grounds for laziness. Firstly, a mendicant has some work to do. They think: 'I have some work to do. But while doing it my body will get tired. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the first ground for laziness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant has done some work. They think: 'I've done some work. But while working my body got tired. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy ... This is the second ground for laziness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn't get to fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine. They think: 'I've wandered for alms, but I didn't get to fill up on as much food as I like, coarse or fine. My body is tired and unfit for work. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy ... This is the fifth ground for laziness.</p>

I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy ... This is the sixth ground for laziness.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant feels a little sick. They think: 'I feel a little sick. Lying down would be good for me. I'd better have a lie down.' They lie down, and don't rouse energy ... This is the seventh ground for laziness.</p>

					<p class="f4">Furthermore, a mendicant has wandered for alms, but they didn't get to fill up on as much food as they like, coarse or fine.

They rouse energy for attaining the unattained, achieving the unachieved, and realizing the unrealized. This is the eighth ground for arousing energy.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight reasons to give. A person might give a gift after insulting the recipient. Or they give out of fear. Or they give thinking, 'They gave to me.' Or they give thinking, 'They'll give to me.' Or they give thinking, 'It's good to give.' Or they give thinking, 'I cook, they don't. It wouldn't be right for me to not give to them.' Or they give thinking, 'By giving this gift I'll get a good reputation.' Or they give thinking, 'This is an adornment and requisite for the mind.'</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight rebirths by giving. First, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. Whatever they give, they expect something back. They see an affluent aristocrat or brahmin or householder amusing themselves, supplied and provided with the five kinds of sensual stimulation. They think: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders!' They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. As they've settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins. Whatever they give, they expect something back. And they've heard: 'The Gods of the Four Great Kings are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.' They think: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Gods of the Four Great Kings!' They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. As they've settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins. Whatever they give, they expect something back. And they've heard: 'The Gods of the Thirty-Three ... the Gods of Yama ... the Joyful Gods ... the Gods Who Love to Create ... the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.' They think: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Gods Who Control the Creations of Others!' They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. As they've settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their purity.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Next, someone gives to ascetics or brahmins such things as food, drink, clothing, vehicles; garlands, fragrance, and makeup; and bed, house, and lighting. Whatever they give, they expect something back. And they've heard: 'The Gods of Brahmā's Group are long-lived, beautiful, and very happy.' They think: 'If only, when my body breaks up, after death, I would be reborn in the company of the Gods of Brahmā's Group!' They settle on that thought, stabilize it and develop it. As they've settled for less and not developed further, their thought leads to rebirth there. But I say that this is only for those of ethical conduct, not for the unethical. And for those free of desire, not those with desire. The heart's wish of an ethical person succeeds because of their freedom from desire.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight assemblies: the assemblies of aristocrats, brahmins, householders, and ascetics. An assembly of the gods under the Four Great Kings. An assembly of the gods under the Thirty-Three. An assembly of Māras. An assembly of Brahmās.</p>

					<p class="f4">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally, limitless, both pretty and ugly. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the fourth dimension of mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. They're like a flax flower that's blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that's smoothed on both sides, blue, with blue color, blue hue, and blue tint. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the fifth dimension of mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not perceiving form internally, someone sees visions externally that are yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint. They're like a champak flower that's yellow, with yellow color, yellow hue, and yellow tint.

They're like the morning star that's white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. Or a cloth from Bāraṇasī that's smoothed on both sides, white, with white color, white hue, and white tint. Mastering them, they perceive: 'I know and see.' This is the eighth dimension of mastery.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Eight liberations. Having physical form, they see visions. This is the first liberation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Not perceiving physical form internally, they see visions externally. This is the second liberation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">They're focused only on beauty. This is the third liberation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space. This is the fourth liberation.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Going totally beyond the dimension of infinite space, aware that 'consciousness is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite consciousness. This is the fifth liberation.</p>

					<p class="f4">Nine progressive meditations. A mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.' Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. Going totally beyond perceptions of form, with the ending of perceptions of impingement, not focusing on perceptions of diversity, aware that 'space is infinite', they enter and remain in the dimension of infinite space.

					<p class="f4">And how does a mendicant possess six factors? A mendicant, seeing a sight with their eyes, is neither happy nor sad. They remain equanimous, mindful and aware.

					<p class="f4">And how has a mendicant stilled the physical process? It's when, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. That's how a mendicant has stilled the physical process.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is a mendicant well freed in mind? It's when a mendicant's mind is freed from greed, hate, and delusion. That's how a mendicant is well freed in mind.</p>
					
					<p class="f4">And how is a mendicant well freed by wisdom? It's when a mendicant understands: 'I've given up greed, hate, and delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them, so they're unable to arise in the future.' That's how a mendicant's mind is well freed by wisdom.</p>

					<p class="f4">Reverends, these are the teachings grouped by ten that have been rightly explained by the Buddha. You should all recite these in concert, without disputing, so that this spiritual path may last for a long time. That would be for the welfare and happiness of the people, for the benefit, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">Then the Buddha got up and said to Venerable Sāriputta: "Good, good, Sāriputta! It's good that you've taught this exposition of the reciting in concert."</p>
					
					<p class="f4">That is what Venerable Sāriputta said, and the teacher approved. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what Sāriputta said.</p>
