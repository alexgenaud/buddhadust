					<p class="f4">Then a mendicant went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Just now, sir, as I was in private retreat this thought came to mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Buddha has spoken of three feelings. Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three feelings the Buddha has spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the Buddha has also said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suffering includes whatever is felt.’</p>

					<p class="f4">What was the Buddha referring to when he said this?"</p>

					<p class="f4">"Good, good, mendicant!</p>

					<p class="f4">I have spoken of these three feelings.</p>

					<p class="f4">Pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the three feelings I have spoken of.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have also said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Suffering includes whatever is felt.’</p>

					<p class="f4">When I said this I was referring to the impermanence of conditions, to the fact that conditions are liable to end, vanish, fade away, cease, and perish.</p>

					<p class="f4">But I have also explained the progressive cessation of conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite space, the perception of form has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the dimension of infinite consciousness, the perception of the dimension of infinite space has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the dimension of nothingness, the perception of the dimension of infinite consciousness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the dimension of neither perception nor non-perception, the perception of the dimension of nothingness has ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have ceased.</p>

					<p class="f4">And I have also explained the progressive stilling of conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">... For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have stilled.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these six levels of tranquility.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the first absorption, speech has been tranquilized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the second absorption, the placing of the mind and keeping it connected have been tranquilized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the third absorption, rapture has been tranquilized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the fourth absorption, breathing has been tranquilized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For someone who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, perception and feeling have been tranquilized.</p>

					<p class="f4">For a mendicant who has ended the defilements, greed, hate, and delusion have been tranquilized."</p>
