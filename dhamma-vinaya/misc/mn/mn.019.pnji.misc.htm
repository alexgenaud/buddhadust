					<p class="f4">Once, the Blessed One was sojourning in Sāvatthī, at the Jetavanarama, the Anāthapiṇḍika's Monastery.</p>

					<p class="f4">While there, the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Oh Bhikkhus"!</p>

					<p class="f4">"Yes Lord". They replied.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One said:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Before my awakening, Bhikkhus, while I was still an unawake Bodhisatta, it occurred to me:</p>

					<p class="f4">"Suppose I distinguish between good thoughts and bad thoughts".</p>

					<p class="f4">So I separated passionate, angry, and violent thoughts; from dispassionate, kind, and peaceful thoughts".</p>

					<p class="f4">When I dwelt thus watchful, alert, and vigilant, a passionate thought arose in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I recognized:</p>

					<p class="f4">"A passionate thought has arisen in me, this can lead to my own harm, to others harm and to the harm of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">It obstructs intelligence, favours destructiveness, and leads me away from Nibbana.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I considered: "this lead to my own harm", it subsided in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I considered: "this leads to others harm," it subsided in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I considered: "this leads to the harm of both," it subsided in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">When I considered: "this obstructs intelligence, and favours destructiveness, and leads me away from Nibbana," it subsided in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Every passionate thought that arose in me, I did not accept it, I rejected it, and I eliminated it.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, when an angry thought arose in me, I did not accept it, I rejected it, and I eliminated it.</p>

					<p class="f4">When a cruel thought arose in me, I did not accept it, I rejected it, and I eliminated it.</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever a Bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders over, the mind will be inclined towards it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he frequently thinks and ponders over passionate thoughts, he has abandoned dispassion, and the mind is inclined more towards passionate thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Similarly, if he frequently thinks and ponders over angry thoughts, he has abandoned kindness, and the mind is inclined more towards anger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Or if he frequently thinks and ponders over cruel thoughts, he has abandoned peacefulness, and his mind becomes inclined more towards thoughts of cruelty.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way I understood the danger, futility and confusion in unwholesome mental states, and I saw the  advantage of cultivating wholesome mental states.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">As I dwelt thus: watchful, alert, and vigilant, a thought of renunciation arose in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I recognized, this thought of renunciation has arisen in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">This does not lead to my own harm, to others harm, or to both myself and others.</p>

					<p class="f4">It promotes intelligence, it supports constructiveness, and it leads me to Nibbana.</p>

					<p class="f4">If I think and ponder over this thought for one night, or for one day, or even for a night and a day, I see no danger.</p>

					<p class="f4">Excessive thinking and pondering, however, might tire my body, and when my body is tired, the mind becomes tired, when the mind is tired, it is far from tranquility.</p>

					<p class="f4">So I steadied my mind internally, quietened it, brought it to a state of perfect tranquility and stillness.</p>

					<p class="f4"> Why is that? In order to prevent the mind from being disturbed.</p>

					<p class="f4">As I dwelt thus, watchful, alert, and vigilant, a thought of peacefulness arose in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then I recognized, this thought of peacefulness has arisen in me.</p>

					<p class="f4">This does not lead to my own harm, to others harm, or to the harm of both.</p>

					<p class="f4">In order to prevent my mind from being disturbed.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4">"Bhikkhus, whatever a Bhikkhu frequently thinks and ponders over, the mind will become inclined towards it.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he frequently thinks and ponders over thoughts of renunciation, he has abandoned passion, and his mind is inclined towards thoughts of renunciation.</p>

					<p class="f4">If he frequently thinks and ponders over thoughts of kindness or of peacefulness, he has abandon anger and cruelty, and his mind inclines towards kind and peaceful thoughts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Having gone thus far, I had only to be aware that those good thoughts were going on in my mind.</p>

					<p class="f4">I realized my vigilant practice has progressed, my unremitting introspective attention was established in me, my body was relaxed and comfortable, and my mind was happy, tranquil, and unified.</p>

					<p class="f4">In this way, withdrawn from passionate thoughts, withdrawn from evil thoughts, I entered upon the first Jhana with observation and inference, experiencing joy and comfort based on mental equilibrium … ultimately I came to realize that: birth is ended, lived is the holy life, done is what has to be done, and no more is the continuity of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">"So Bhikkhus, the safe and good path to be travelled joyfully has been reopened by me, the wrong path has been closed off.</p>

					<p class="f4">What a teacher who seeks your welfare, and has compassion for you can do, that I have done for you, bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">There are these roots of trees, and these empty huts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhikkhus meditate, do not delay, or else you will regret it later.</p>

					<p class="f4">This is my advice to you".</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus was the Blessed One's utterance.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus were delighted and inspired by what the Blessed One said.</p>
