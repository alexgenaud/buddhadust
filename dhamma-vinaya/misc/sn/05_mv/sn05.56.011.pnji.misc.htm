					<p class="f4">The Sublime One was liviing in Banares; Isipatana at Migadaye.</p>

					<p class="f4">While there, the Sublime One addressed the renunciates:</p>

					<p class="f4">"These two extremes should be avoided by the progressor:</p>

					<p class="f4">The devotion that is dependence<br />
					on the pleasure in sense pleasures<br />
					which is inferior,<br />
					secular,<br />
					common,<br />
					not extra-ordinary,<br />
					and futile.</p>

					<p class="f4">The devotion that is self-mortification,<br />
					which is uneasy,<br />
					not extra-ordinary,<br />
					and futile.</p>

					<p class="f4">Without entering on these two extremes<br />
					the Realized One is super-awakened<br />
					to the Middle Path<br />
					which bestows vision,<br />
					bestows understanding,<br />
					which evolves into inner tranquility,<br />
					to super-understanding,<br />
					to awakening,<br />
					and to serenity (Nirvana).</p>

					<p class="f4">What, renunciates, is this Middle Path<br />
					which the Realized One has super-awakened to?<br />
					Which bestows vision,<br />
					bestows understanding<br />
					which evolves into inner tranquility,<br />
					to super-understanding,<br />
					to awakening,<br />
					and to serenity (Nirvana)?</p>

					<p class="f4">It is this Extra-ordinary Eightfold Way, namely:<br />
					harmonious perspective<br />
					harmonious visualization<br />
					harmonious speech<br />
					harmonious action<br />
					harmonious practice<br />
					harmonious awareness<br />
					harmonious mental repose</p>

					<p class="f4">This, renunciates, is the Middle Path<br />
					which the Realized One has super-awakened to,<br />
					which bestows vision<br />
					bestows understanding<br />
					which evolves into inner tranquility,<br />
					to super-understanding,<br />
					to awakening,<br />
					and to serenity (Nirvana).</p>

					<p class="f4">This renunciates, is the Extra-Ordinary Truth of Unease:</p>

					<p class="f4">Birth is unease<br />
					decay is unease<br />
					disease is unease<br />
					death is unease<br />
					associatiuon with the unpleasant is unease<br />
					disassociation from the pleasant is unease<br />
					non-fullfillment of desire is unease<br />
					in essence, the five aggregates of identification are unease.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, renunciates, is the Extra-Ordinary Truth of the Arising of Unease:</p>

					<p class="f4">That which is the recurring urge<br />
					accompanied by pleasure and passion,<br />
					finding pleasure everywhere.<br />
					Namely:</p>

					<p class="f4">The urge for sense desire<br />
					the urge for existence<br />
					the urge for non-existence</p>

					<p class="f4">This, renunciates, is the Extra-Ordinary Truth of the Stopping of Unease:</p>

					<p class="f4">Whatever is the non-residual,<br />
					dispassionate,<br />
					stopping of that urge;<br />
					it's sacrifice,<br />
					it's complete renunciation,<br />
					and the freedom and disattachment from it.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, renunciates, is the Extra-Ordinary Truth<br />
					of the Path leading to the stopping of Unease:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is the Extra-Ordinary Eightfold Way, namely:<br />
					harmonious perspective;<br />
					harmonious visualization;<br />
					harmonious speech;<br />
					harmonious action;<br />
					harmonious practice;<br />
					harmonious awareness;<br />
					harmonious mental repose."</p>

					<p class="f4">The revolution of the wheel of experience from unease to ease</p>

					<p class="f4">With the realization,<br />
					'This is the Extra-Ordinary Truth of Unease',<br />
					renunciates,<br />
					an eye (vision) arose in me,<br />
					understanding arose,<br />
					prime understanding arose,<br />
					sentience arose,<br />
					light arose,<br />
					concerning experience ...<br />
					unheard of before.</p>

					<p class="f4">So long, renunciates,<br />
					as these four Extra-Ordinary Truths<br />
					did not become clear to me<br />
					through this twelve-fold tripple revolutionary<br />
					understanding and vision<br />
					of how things have come to exist,<br />
					I did not know<br />
					that in the world consisting of gods,<br />
					devils, gods, saints, priests,<br />
					and the common people,<br />
					of celestial and human beings,<br />
					I am one super-awakened<br />
					to that unsurpassble harmonious awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">When, renunciates,<br />

					I am one super-awakened<br />
					to that unsurpassable harmonious awakening.</p>

					<p class="f4">Understanding and vision has arisen in me;<br />
					unexcitable is my emotional freedom;<br />
					this is my last birth;<br />
					no more are these recurrences of existence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus spoke the Sublime One.<br />
					Approving, the group of five renunciates<br />
					were extremely delighted with what the Sublime One spoke.</p>

					<p class="f4">While being spoken to,<br />
					in this way of expression,<br />
					the undefiled, unstained eye of (vision) of experience<br />
					arose for the Venerable Kondanna:<br />
					'What ever is experienced as arisen,<br />
					all that is experienced (also) as stopped.'</p>
