					The Sutta-Nipata</h4>

					<p><span class="f4">T</span><span class="f2"><b>HE</b></span> Collection of Discourses, Sutta-Nipāta, which I have here translated,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> is very remarkable, as there can be no doubt that it contains some remnants of Primitive Buddhism. I consider the greater part of the Mahāvagga, and nearly the whole of the Aṭṭhakavagga as very old. I have arrived at this conclusion from two reasons, first from the language, and secondly from the contents.</p>

					<p>1. We not only find here what we meet with in other Pāli poetry, the fuller Vedic forms of nouns and verbs in the plural, as <i>avītataɱhāse, paṇḍitāse, dhammāse, sitāse, upaṭṭhitāse, pavādiyāse, etc,</i> and <i>karāmase, asmase, sikkhissāmase;</i> the shorter Vedic plurals and the instrumental singular of nouns, as <i>vinikkhayā, lakkhaṇā for vinikkhayāni, lakkhaṇāni, mantā, pariññā, vinayā, lābhakamyā for mantāya, etc;</i> Vedic infinitives, as <i>vippahātave, sampayātave, uṇṇametave;</i> contracted (or sometimes old) forms, as <i>santyā, gakkā, duggakkā, sammukkā, titthyā, thiyo, parihīrati</i> for <i>santiyā, gātiyā, sammutiyā, titthiyā, itthiyo, parihariyati,</i> by the side of protracted forms, such as <i>ātumānaɱ;</i> but also some unusual (sometimes old) forms and words, as <i>apukkhasi, sagghasi</i><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup> = <i>sakkhissasi, sussaɱ = suṇissāmi (Sansk. <b>s</b>roshyāmi), pāva and pāvā = vadati, pavekkhe = paveseyya, parikissati = parikilissati, vineyya, vikeyya, nikkheyya, pappuyya, = vinayitvā, etc, daṭṭhu = disvā (S. d<b>r</b>ishṭvā), atisitvā = atikkamitvā, anuvikka = anuviditvā, paribbasāna = vasamāna, amhanā (S. asmanā) = pāsāṇena, vākībhi, katubbhi, rattamahābhi, ise (vocative), suvāmi = sāmi, maga = miga, <a id="pgxii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xii]</b></span></a> tumo = so, parovara = parāvara, bhūnahu = bhūtihanaka, upaya, āmagandha, dhona, vyappatha, vyappathi, vevikkhā, visenibhūta, visenikatvā, paṭiseniyanti.</i></span> Sometimes we meet also with difficult and irregular constructions, and very condensed expressions. All this proves, I think, that these parts of the book are much older than the Suttas in which the language is not only fluent, but of which some verses are even singularly melodious.</p>

					<p>2. In the contents of the Suttanipāta we have, I think, an important contribution to the right understanding of Primitive Buddhism, for we see here a picture not of life in monasteries, but of the life of hermits in its first stage. We have before us not the systematizing of the later Buddhist church, but the first germs of a system, the fundamental ideas of which come out with sufficient clearness. From the Aṭṭhakavagga especially it is evident where Buddha takes his stand in opposition to Philosophy (<i>diṭṭhi = dar<b>s</b>ana</i>).</p>

					<p>Indian society at the time of Buddha had two large and distinguished religious sects, Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas. This is apparent from several passages where they are mentioned together; for instance, <i>Vinaya,</i> ed. Oldenberg, II, p. 295; Grimblot, <i>Sept Suttas Pālis,</i> p. ix, 8 etc, 118 etc, 158 etc, 306 etc, 309; <i>Dhammapada,</i> p. 392; <i>Suttanipāta;</i> vv. 99, 129, 189, 440, 529, 859, 1078; <i>Sabhiyasutta,</i> at the beginning; the <i>Inscriptions of Asoka; Mahābhāshya</i>, II, 4, 9 (fol. 398 a); <i>Lalita Vistara,</i> pp. 309, l. 10, 318, l. 18, 320, l. 20; and lastly, <i>Megasthenes</i> (Schwanbeck, p. 45), {Greek: <i>dúo génh figodófwn, wn toùs mèn Braxmanas kalei, toùs dè Sarmanas</i>}.</p>

					<p>Famous teachers arose and gathered around them flocks of disciples. As such are mentioned Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakarnbali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>; see Suttanipāta, p. 86; Mahāparinibbānasutta, ed. Childers, p. 58; Vinaya II, p. 111; Grimblot, <i>Sept Suttas Pālis,</i> p. 114, etc; <i>Milindapañha</i>, ed. Trenckner, p. 4. Besides these there is Bāvari (Suttanipāta, p. 184), and his disciples Agita, Tissametteyya, Puññaka, Mettagū, Dhotaka, Upasīva, Nanda, <a id="pgxiii"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xiii]</b></span></a> Hemaka, Todeyya, Kappa, Gatukaṇṇin, Bhadrāvudha, Udaya, Posāla, Mogharāgan (Piŋgiya, vv. 1006-1008; Sela, p. 98), and, Kaŋkin, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Gānussoṇi, Vāseṭṭha, and Bhāradvāga, p. 109.</p>

					<p>We learn that there were four kinds of Samaṇas, viz. Maggaginas, Maggadesakas (or Maggadesins, Maggagghāyins), Maggagīvins, and Maggadūsins, vv. 83-88. Among these Samaṇas disputes arose, vv. 828, 883-884; a number of philosophical systems were formed, and at the time of Buddha there were as many as sixty-three of them, v. 538. These systems are generally designated by <i>diṭṭhi,</i> vv. 54, 151, 786, 837, 851, etc; or by <i>ditthigata,</i> vv. 834, 836, 913; or by <i>diṭhasuta,</i> v. 778; or by <i>diṭṭha, suta,</i> and <i>muta,</i> vv. 793, 813, 914; or by <i>diṭṭha, suta, silavata</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> and <i>muta,</i> vv. 790, 797-798, 836, 887, 1080. The doctrines themselves are called <i>diṭṭhinivesa,</i> v. 785; or <i>nivesana,</i> vv. 209, 470, 801, 846; or <i>vinikkhaya,</i> vv. 838, 866, 887, 894; and he who entertains any of them, is called <i>nivissavādin,</i> vv. 910, 913.</p>

					<p>What is said of the Samaṇas seems mostly to hold good about the Brāhmaṇas also. They too are called disputatious, <i>vādasīla,</i> v. 381, etc, p. 109; and three kinds of them are mentioned, viz. Titthiyas, Āgīvikas, and Nigaṇthas, vv. 380, 891-892. ln contradistinction to the Samaṇas the Brāhmaṇas are designated as Teviggas, vv. 594, 1019; they are Padakas, Veyyākaraṇas, and perfect in Gappa, Nighaṇḍu, Keṭubha, Itihāsa, etc, v. 595, p. 98. They are called friends of the hymns, v. 139; well versed in the hymns, v. 976; and their principal hymn is Sāvitti,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> vv. 568, 456. They worship and make offerings to the fire, pp. 74, 20. In Brāhmaṇadhammikasutta the ancient and just Brāhmaṇas are described in opposition to the later <a id="pgxiv"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xiv]</b></span></a> Brāhmaṇas, who slay innocent cows and have acquired wealth through the favour of the kings. vv. 307, 308, 311, 302.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>All these disputants hold fast to their own prejudiced views, v. 910. They say that purity comes from philosophical views, from tradition, and from virtuous works, and in many other ways, v. 1078, and that there is no bliss excepting by following their opinions, vv. 889, 891, 892.</p>

					<p>Buddha himself has, it is true, sprung from the Samaṇas: he is called Samaṇa Gotama, p. 96; he shines like a sun in the midst of the Samaṇas, v. 550; and intercourse with Samaṇas is said to be the highest blessing, v. 265. But Buddha has overcome all their systems, v. 538; there is nothing which has not been seen, heard, or thought by him, and nothing which has not been understood by him, v. 1121. All the disputatious Brāhmaṇas do not overcome him in understanding, v. 380; and he asserts that no one is purified and saved by philosophy or by virtuous works, vv. 1079, 839. Sanctification, in fact, does not come from another, vv. 773, 790, 813; it can be attained only by going into the yoke with Buddha, v. 834; by believing in him and in the Dhamma of the Saints, vv. 183, 185, 370, 1142; on the whole, by being what Buddha is.</p>

					<p>What then is Buddha?</p>

					<p>First he is a Visionary, in the good sense of the word; his knowledge is intuitive. 'Seeing misery,' he says, 'in the philosophical views, without adopting any of them, searching for truth, I saw inward peace,' vv. 837, 207. And again, 'He, a conqueror unconquered, saw the Dhamma visibly, without any traditional instruction,' vv. 934, 1052, 1065. He teaches an instantaneous, an immediate religious life, vv. 567, 1136. He is called <i>kakkhumat,</i> endowed with an eye, clearly-seeing, vv. 160, 405, 540, 562, 596, 956, 992, 1028, 1115, 1127; <i>samantakakkhu,</i> the all-seeing, vv. 1062, 1068; and as such he has become an eye to the world, v. 599. He sees the subtle meaning of things, vv. 376, 175; he is, in one word, <i>Sambuddha,</i> the perfectly-enlightened, vv. 177, 555, 596, 992; and by knowledge he is delivered, vv. 1106, <a id="pgxv"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xv]</b></span></a> 727, 733. Existence is aviggā, ignorance, v. 729; vigga, knowledge, is the extinction of the world, v. 730.</p>

					<p>Secondly, he is an Ascetic, a <i>Muni</i>,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> one that forsakes the world and wanders from the house to the houseless state, vv. 273, 375, 1003; because from house-life arises defilement, v. 206. An ascetic has no prejudiced ideas, v. 802; he has shaken off every philosophical view, v. 787; he does not enter into disputes, v. 887; he is not pleased nor displeased with anything, v. 813; he is indifferent to learning, v. 911; he does not cling to good and evil, vv. 520, 547, 790; he has cut off all passion and all desire, vv. 2, 795, 1130, 916; he is free from marks, v. 847; and possessionless, <i>akiñkana,</i> vv. 175, 454, 490, 620, 1058, 1062, 976, 1069, 1114. He is equable, v. 855; under all circumstances the same, v. 952; still as the deep water, v. 920; calm, vv. 459, 861. He has reached peace, vv. 837, 845, 919; he knows that bliss consists in peace, v. 933; he has gone to immortal peace, the unchangeable state of <i>Nibbāna,</i> v. 203. And how is this state brought about? By the destruction of consciousness, vv. 734-735. And how does consciousness cease? By the cessation of sensation, vv. 1109-1110; by being without breathing, vv. 1089-1090.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p>1. What then is sin according to Buddha?</p>

					<p>Subjectively sin is desire, in all its various forms, vv. 923, 1103; viz. desire tor existence generally, vv. 776, 1059, 1067, and especially for name and form, i.e. individual existence, vv. 354, 1099. As long as man is led by desire he will be whirled about in existence, v. 740; for as long as there is birth, there will be death, v. 742. Existence is called the stream of death, v. 354; the realm of Māra, vv. 164, 1145. Those who continually go to <i>saɱsāra</i> with birth and death, are the ignorant, v. 729. <a id="pgxvi"><span class="f2 g"><b>[xvi]</b></span></a> But desire originates in the body, vv. 270, 1099; sin lies objectively in embodiment or matter, and consequently the human body is looked upon as a contemptible thing. See Vigayasutta, p. 32.</p>

					<p>2. And what is bliss?</p>

					<p>Subjectively, it is emancipation from desire by means of the peace that Buddha preaches, vv. 1065-1066, 1069, 1084, 1108, 838-839.</p>

					<p>Objectively, it is emancipation from body and matter. One must destroy the elements of existence, <i>upadhī,</i> vv. 373, 546, 1050, 1056; and leave the body behind, that one may not come to exist again, vv. 1120, 1122, 761. The ignorant only create <i>upadhi,</i> v. 1050, and go again and again to <i>saɱsāra,</i> v. 729. The wise do not enter time, <i>kappa,</i> vv. 521, 535, 860; they look upon the world as void, v. 1118; hold that there is nothing really existing, v. 1069; and those whose minds are disgusted with a future existence, the wise who have destroyed their seeds (of existence), go out like a lamp, vv. 234, 353-354. As a flame, blown about by the violence of the wind, goes out, and cannot be reckoned (as existing), even so a <i>Muni,</i> delivered from name and body, disappears, and cannot be reckoned (as existing), v. 1073. For him who has disappeared, there is no form; that by which they say he is, exists for him no longer, v. 1075.</p>

					<p>'Exert thyself, then, O Dhotaka,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'being wise and thoughtful in this world, let one, having listened to my utterance, learn his own extinction,' v. 1061.</p>

					<p class="ctr">A dialogue between the rich herdsman Dhaniya and Buddha, the one rejoicing in his worldly security and the other in his religious belief. — This beautiful dialogue calls to mind the parable in the Gospel of S.Luke xii.16.</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v18"><span class="f2 c"><b>[18]</b></span></a> 'I have boiled (my) rice, I have milked (my cows),' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'I am living together with my fellows near the banks of the Mahī (river), (my) house is covered, the fire is kindled: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v20"><span class="f2 c"><b>[20]</b></span></a> 'Gad-flies are not to be found (with me),' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'in meadows abounding with grass the cows are roaming, and they can endure rain when it comes: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">4. <a id="v21"><span class="f2 c"><b>[21]</b></span></a> '(By me) is made a well-constructed raft,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'I have passed over (to Nibbāna), I have reached the further bank, having overcome the torrent (of passions); there is no (further) use for a raft: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">5. <a id="v22"><span class="f2 c"><b>[22]</b></span></a> 'My wife is obedient, not wanton,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'for a long time she has been living together (with me), she is winning, and I hear nothing wicked of her: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. <a id="v23"><span class="f2 c"><b>[23]</b></span></a> 'My mind is obedient, delivered (from all worldliness),' — so said Bhagavat, — 'it has for a long time been highly cultivated and well-subdued, there is no longer anything wicked in me: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">7. <a id="v24"><span class="f2 c"><b>[24]</b></span></a> 'I support myself by my own earnings,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'and my children are (all) about me, healthy; I hear nothing wicked of them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">8. <a id="v25"><span class="f2 c"><b>[25]</b></span></a> 'I am no one's servant,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'with what I have gained I wander about in all the world, there is no need (for me) to serve: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">9. <a id="v26"><span class="f2 c"><b>[26]</b></span></a> 'I have cows, I have calves,' —  so said the herdsman Dhaniya; — 'I have cows in calf and heifers, and I have also a bull as lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> 10. <a id="v27"><span class="f2 c"><b>[27]</b></span></a> 'I have no cows, I have no calves,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'I have no cows in calf and no heifers, and I have no bull as a lord over the cows: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!</p>

					<p class="f4">11. <a id="v28"><span class="f2 c"><b>[28]</b></span></a>'The stakes are driven in, and cannot be shaken,' — so said the herdsman Dhaniya, — 'the ropes are made of munga grass, new and well-made, the cows will not be able to break them: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!'</p>

					<p class="f4">12. <a id="v29"><span class="f2 c"><b>[29]</b></span></a> 'Having, like a bull, rent the bonds; having, like an elephant, broken through the galukkhi creeper, I shall not again enter into a womb: therefore, if thou like, rain, O sky!' </p>

					<p class="f4">Then at once a shower poured down, filling both sea and land. Hearing the sky raining, Dhaniya spoke thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">13. <a id="v30"><span class="f2 c"><b>[30]</b></span></a> 'No small gain indeed (has accrued) to us since we have seen Bhagavat; we take refuge in thee, O (thou who art) endowed with the eye (of wisdom); be thou our master, O great Muni!'</p>

					<p class="f4">14. <a id="v31"><span class="f2 c"><b>[31]</b></span></a> 'Both my wife and myself are obedient; (if) we lead a holy life before Sugata, we shall conquer birth and death, and put an end to pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">15. <a id="v32"><span class="f2 c"><b>[32]</b></span></a> 'He who has sons has delight in sons,' — so said the wicked Māra, — 'he who has cows has delight likewise in cows; for upadhi (substance) is the delight of man, but he who has no upadhi has no delight.'</p>

					<p class="f4">16. <a id="v33"><span class="f2 c"><b>[33]</b></span></a> 'He who has sons has care with (his) sons,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'he who has cows has likewise care with (his) cows; for upadhi (is the cause of) people's cares, but he who has no upadhi has no care.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Brāhmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga reproaches Gotama with idleness, but the latter convinces him that he (Buddha) also works, and so the Brāhmaṇa is converted, and finally becomes a saint.<br />
					Compare Sp. Hardy, A Manual of Buddhism, p. 214; Gospel of S. John v. 17.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Magadha at Dakkhiṇāgiri in the Brāmana village Ekanaḷā. And at that time the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's five hundred <a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> ploughs were tied (to the yokes) in the sowing season. Then Bhagavat, in the morning, having put on his raiment and taken his bowl and robes, went to the place where the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's work (was going on). At that time the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga's distribution of food took place. Then Bhagavat went to the place where the distribution of food took place, and having gone there, he stood apart. The Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga saw Bhagavat standing there to get alms, and having seen him, he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I, O Samaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat; thou also, O Samaṇa, shouldst plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, thou shouldst eat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I also, O Brāmaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yet we do not see the yoke, or the plough, or the ploughshare, or the goad, or the oxen of the venerable Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And then the venerable Gotama spoke in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I also, O Brāmaṇa, both plough and sow, and having ploughed and sown, I eat,' so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibharadvaga addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v75"><span class="f2 c"><b>[75]</b></span></a> 'Thou professest to be a ploughman, and yet we do not see thy ploughing; asked about (thy) ploughing, tell us (of it), that we may know thy ploughing.'</p>

					<p class="f4">2. <a id="v76"><span class="f2 c"><b>[76]</b></span></a> Bhagavat answered: 'Faith is the seed, penance the rain, understanding my yoke and plough, modesty the pole of the plough, mind the tie, thoughtfulness my ploughshare and goad.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v77"><span class="f2 c"><b>[77]</b></span></a> 'I am guarded in respect of the body, I am <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> guarded in respect of speech, temperate in food; I make truth to cut away (weeds), tenderness is my deliverance.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. <a id="v78"><span class="f2 c"><b>[78]</b></span></a> 'Exertion is my beast of burden; carrying (me) to Nibbāna he goes without turning back to the place where having gone one does not grieve.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. <a id="v79"><span class="f2 c"><b>[79]</b></span></a> 'So this ploughing is ploughed, it bears the fruit of immortality; having ploughed this ploughing one is freed from all pain.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga, having poured rice-milk into a golden bowl, offered it to Bhagavat, saying, 'Let the venerable Bhagavat eat of the rice-milk; the venerable is a ploughman, for the venerable Gotama ploughs a ploughing that bears the fruit of immortality.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. <a id="v80"><span class="f2 c"><b>[80]</b></span></a> Bhagavat said: 'What is acquired by reciting stanzas is not to be eaten by me; this is, O Brāmaṇa, not the Dhamma of those that see rightly; Buddha rejects what is acquired by reciting stanzas, this is the conduct (of Buddhas) as long as the Dhamma exists.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. <a id="v81"><span class="f2 c"><b>[81]</b></span></a> 'One who is an accomplished great Isi, whose passions are destroyed and whose misbehaviour has ceased, thou shouldst serve with other food and drink, for this is the field for one who looks for good works.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">'To whom then, O Gotama, shall I give this rice-milk?' so said Kasibhāradvāga.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see, O Brāmaṇa, in the world (of men) <a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> and gods and Māras and Brahmans, amongst beings comprising gods and men, and Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas, any by whom this rice-milk when eaten can be properly digested with the exception of Tathāgata, or a disciple of Tathāgata. Therefore, O Brāmaṇa, thou shalt throw this rice-milk in (a place where there is) little grass, or cast it into water with no worms: so said Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga threw the rice-milk into some water with no worms. Then the rice-milk thrown into the water splashed, hissed, smoked in volumes; for as a ploughshare that has got hot during the day when thrown into the water splashes, hisses, and smokes in volumes, even so the rice-milk (when) thrown into the water splashed, hissed, and smoked in volumes.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga alarmed and terrified went up to Bhagavat, and after having approached and fallen with his head at Bhagavat's feet, he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma (has been) illustrated. I take refuge in the venerable Gotama and in the Dhamma and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; I wish to receive the <i>pabbaggā,</i> I wish to receive the upasampada (the robe and the orders) from the venerable Gotama,' so said Kasibharadvaga.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Kasibhāradvāga received the <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> <i>pabbaggā</i> from Bhagavat, and he received also the <i>upasampadā;</i> and the venerable Bhāradvāga having lately received the <i>upasampadā;</i>, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander, away from their houses to houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Bhāradvāga became one of the arahats (saints).</p>

The Brāmaṇa Aggikabhāradvāga saw Bhagavat coming at a distance, and seeing him he said this: 'Stay there, O Shaveling; (stay) there, O Samaṇaka (i.e. wretched Samaṇa); (stay) there, O Vasalaka (i.e. outcast)!'</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Yakkha Āḷavaka first threatens Buddha, then puts some questions to him which Buddha answers, whereupon Āḷavaka is converted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Āḷavi, in the realm of the Yakkha Āḷavaka. Then the Yakkha Āḷavaka went to the place where Bhagavat dwelt, and having gone there he said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat came out.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Enter, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg30"><span class="f2 g"><b>[30]</b></span></a> 'Yes, O friend!' so saying Bhagavat entered.</p>

					<p class="f4">A fourth time the Yakkha Āḷavaka said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come out, O Samaṇa!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall not come out to thee, O friend, do what thou pleasest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall ask thee a question, O Samaṇa, if thou canst not answer it, I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by thy feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ganga.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see, O friend, any one in this world nor in the world of gods, Māras, Brahmans, amongst the beings comprising gods, men, Samaṇas, and Brāhmaṇas, who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over to the other shore of the Ganga; however, O friend, ask what thou pleasest.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Yakkha Āḷavaka addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v182"><span class="f2 c"><b>[182]</b></span></a> Āḷavaka said: 'How does one cross the stream (of existence)? how does one cross the sea? how does one conquer pain? how is one purified?'</p>

					<p class="f4">4. <a id="v183"><span class="f2 c"><b>[183]</b></span></a> Bhagavat said: 'By faith one crosses the stream, by zeal the sea, by exertion one conquers pain, by understanding one is purified.'</p>

					<p class="f4">6. <a id="v185"><span class="f2 c"><b>[185]</b></span></a> Bhagavat said: 'He who believes in the Dhamma of the venerable ones as to the acquisition of Nibbāna, will obtain understanding from his desire to hear, being zealous and discerning.</p>

					<p class="ctr">The Yakkha Sūkiloma threatens to harm Buddha, if he cannot answer his questions. Buddha answers that all passions proceed from the body.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Gaya (seated) on a stone seat in the realm of the Yakkha Sūkiloma. And at that time the Yakkha Khara and the Yakkha Sūkiloma passed by, not far from Bhagavat. And then the Yakkha Khara said this to the Yakkha Sūkiloma: 'Is this man a Samaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sūkiloma answered: 'He is no Samaṇa, he is a Samaṇaka (a wretched Samaṇa); however I will ascertain whether he is a Samaṇa or a Samaṇaka.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Yakkha Sūkiloma went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up to him, he brushed against Bhagavat's body. Then Bhagavat took away his body. Then the Yakkha Sūkiloma said this to Bhagavat: 'O Samaṇa, art thou afraid of me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, friend, I am not afraid of thee, but thy touching me is sinful.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Sūkiloma said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I will ask thee a question, O Samaṇa; if thou canst not answer it I will either scatter thy thoughts or cleave thy heart, or take thee by the feet and throw thee over to the other shore of the Ganga.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not see, O friend, neither in this world together with the world of the Devas, Māras, Brahmans, nor amongst the generation of Samaṇa and Brāhmaṇas, gods and men, the one who can either scatter my thoughts or cleave my heart, or take me by the feet and throw me over <a id="pg46"><span class="f2 g"><b>[46]</b></span></a> to the other shore of the Ganga. However ask, O friend, what thou pleasest.' Then the Yakkha Sūkiloma addressed Bhagavat in a stanza:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v269"><span class="f2 c"><b>[269]</b></span></a> ' What origin have passion and hatred, disgust, delight, and horror? wherefrom do they arise? whence arising do doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow?'</p>

					<p class="f4">2. <a id="v270"><span class="f2 c"><b>[270]</b></span></a> Buddha said: 'Passion and hatred have their origin from this (body), disgust, delight, and horror arise from this body; arising from this (body) doubts vex the mind, as boys vex a crow.</p>

					<p class="ctr">Wealthy Brāhmaṇas come to Buddha, asking about the customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas. Buddha describes their mode of life and the change wrought in them by seeing the king's riches, and furthermore, how they induced the king to commit the sin of <a id="pg48"><span class="f2 g"><b>[48]</b></span></a> having living creatures slain at sacrifices. On hearing Buddha's enlightened discourse the wealthy Brāhmaṇas are converted. Compare Sp. Hardy's <i>Legends,</i> p. 46.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī, in Getavana, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Then many wealthy Brāhmaṇas of Kosala, decrepit, elderly, old, advanced in age, or arrived at extreme old age, went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him they talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable talk with him, they sat down apart. Sitting down apart these wealthy Brāhmaṇas said this to Bhagavat: 'O venerable Gotama, are the Brāhmaṇas now-a-days seen (engaged) in the Brāhmanical customs (dhamma) of the ancient Brāhmaṇas?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Brāhmaṇas now-a-days, O Brāhmaṇas, are not seen (engaged) in the Brāhmanical customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Brāhmaṇas said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Gotama tell us the Brāhmanical customs of the ancient Brāhmaṇas, if it is not inconvenient to the venerable Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat answered:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then listen, O Brāhmaṇas, pay great attention, I will speak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes,' so saying the wealthy Brāhmaṇas listened to Bhagavat.</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat said this:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v283"><span class="f2 c"><b>[283]</b></span></a> The old sages <i>(isayo)</i> were self-restrained, penitent; having abandoned the objects of the five senses, they studied their own welfare.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. <a id="v284"><span class="f2 c"><b>[284]</b></span></a> There were no cattle for the Brāhmaṇas, nor gold, nor corn, (but) the riches and corn of meditation were for them, and they kept watch over the best treasure.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg49"><span class="f2 g"><b>[49]</b></span></a> 3. <a id="v285"><span class="f2 c"><b>[285]</b></span></a> What was prepared for them and placed as food at the door, they thought was to be given to those that seek for what has been prepared by faith.</p>

					<p class="f4">4. <a id="v286"><span class="f2 c"><b>[286]</b></span></a> With garments variously coloured, with beds and abodes, prosperous people from the provinces and the whole country worshipped those Brāhmaṇas.</p>

					<p class="f4">5. <a id="v287"><span class="f2 c"><b>[287]</b></span></a> Inviolable were the Brāhmaṇas, invincible, protected by the Dhamma, no one opposed them (while standing) at the doors of the houses anywhere.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. <a id="v288"><span class="f2 c"><b>[288]</b></span></a> For forty-eight years they practised juvenile chastity, the Brāhmaṇas formerly went in search of science and exemplary conduct.</p>

					<p class="f4">7. <a id="v289"><span class="f2 c"><b>[289]</b></span></a> The Brāhmaṇas did not marry (a woman belonging to) another (caste), nor did they buy a wife; they chose living together in mutual love after having come together.</p>

					<p class="f4">8. <a id="v290"><span class="f2 c"><b>[290]</b></span></a> Excepting from the time about the cessation of the menstruation else the Brāhmaṇas did not indulge in sexual intercourse.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">9. <a id="v291"><span class="f2 c"><b>[291]</b></span></a> They praised chastity and virtue, rectitude, mildness, penance, tenderness, compassion, and patience.</p>

					<p class="f4">10. <a id="v292"><span class="f2 c"><b>[292]</b></span></a> He who was the best of them, a strong Brāhmaṇa, did not (even) in sleep indulge in sexual intercourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">11. <a id="v293"><span class="f2 c"><b>[293]</b></span></a> Imitating his practices some wise men in this world praised chastity and patience.</p>

					<p class="f4">12. <a id="v294"><span class="f2 c"><b>[294]</b></span></a> Having asked for rice, beds, garments, butter. and oil, and gathered them justly, they made sacrifices <a id="pg50"><span class="f2 g"><b>[50]</b></span></a> out of them, and when the sacrifice came on, they did not kill cows.</p>

					<p class="f4">13. <a id="v295"><span class="f2 c"><b>[295]</b></span></a> Like unto a mother, a father, a brother, and other relatives the cows are our best friends, in which medicines are produced.</p>

					<p class="f4">14. <a id="v296"><span class="f2 c"><b>[296]</b></span></a> They give food, and they give strength, they likewise give (a good) complexion and happiness; knowing the real state of this, they did not kill cows.</p>

					<p class="f4">15. <a id="v297"><span class="f2 c"><b>[297]</b></span></a> They were graceful, large, handsome, renowned, Brāhmaṇas by nature, zealous for their several works; as long as they lived in the world, this race prospered.</p>

					<p class="f4">16. <a id="v298"><span class="f2 c"><b>[298]</b></span></a> But there was a change in them: after gradually seeing the king's prosperity and adorned women,</p>

					<p class="f4">17. <a id="v299"><span class="f2 c"><b>[299]</b></span></a> Well-made chariots drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours, palaces and houses, divided into compartments and measured out,</p>

					<p class="f4">18. <a id="v300"><span class="f2 c"><b>[300]</b></span></a> The great human wealth, attended with a number of cows, and combined with a flock of beautiful women, the Brāhmaṇas became covetous.</p>

					<p class="f4">19. <a id="v301"><span class="f2 c"><b>[301]</b></span></a> They then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went to Okkāka, and said: 'Thou hast much wealth and corn, sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy great wealth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">20. <a id="v302"><span class="f2 c"><b>[302]</b></span></a> And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brāhmaṇas, brought about <i>assamedha, purisamedha, sammāpāsa,</i> and <i>vākāpeyya</i> without any hindrance, and having offered these sacrifices he gave the Brāhmaṇas wealth:</p>

					<p class="f4">21. <a id="v303"><span class="f2 c"><b>[303]</b></span></a> Cows, beds, garments, and adorned women, and well-made chariots, drawn by noble horses, carpets in variegated colours,</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg51"><span class="f2 g"><b>[51]</b></span></a> 22. <a id="v304"><span class="f2 c"><b>[304]</b></span></a> Beautiful palaces, well divided into compartments; and having filled these with different (sorts of) corn, he gave this wealth to the Brāhmaṇas.</p>

					<p class="f4">23. <a id="v305"><span class="f2 c"><b>[305]</b></span></a> And they having thus received wealth wished for a store, and the desire of those who had given way to (their) wishes increased still more; they then, in this matter, having composed hymns, went again to Okkāka, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">24. <a id="v306"><span class="f2 c"><b>[306]</b></span></a> 'As water, earth, gold, wealth, and corn, even so are there cows for men, for this is a requisite for living beings; sacrifice thy great property, sacrifice thy wealth.'</p>

					<p class="f4">25. <a id="v307"><span class="f2 c"><b>[307]</b></span></a> And then the king, the lord of chariots, instructed by the Brāhmaṇas, caused many hundred thousand cows to be slain in offerings.</p>

					<p class="f4">26. <a id="v308"><span class="f2 c"><b>[308]</b></span></a> The cows, that are like goats, do not hurt any one with their feet or with either of their horns, they are tender, and yield vessels (of milk), — seizing them by the horns the king caused them to be slain with a weapon.</p>

					<p class="f4">27. <a id="v309"><span class="f2 c"><b>[309]</b></span></a> Then the gods, the forefathers, Inda, the Asuras, and the Rakkhasas cried out: 'This is injustice,' because of the weapon falling on the cows.</p>

					<p class="f4">28. <a id="v310"><span class="f2 c"><b>[310]</b></span></a> There were formerly three diseases: desire, hunger, and decay, but from the slaying of cattle there came ninety-eight.</p>

					<p class="f4">29. <a id="v311"><span class="f2 c"><b>[311]</b></span></a> This injustice of (using) violence that has come down (to us), was old; innocent (cows) are slain, the sacrificing (priests) have fallen off from the Dhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">30. <a id="v312"><span class="f2 c"><b>[312]</b></span></a> So this old and mean Dhamma is blamed by the wise; where people see such a one, they blame the sacrificing priest.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg52"><span class="f2 g"><b>[52]</b></span></a> 31. <a id="v313"><span class="f2 c"><b>[313]</b></span></a> So Dhamma being lost, the Suddas and the Vessikas disagreed, the Khattiyas disagreed in manifold ways, the wife despised her husband.</p>

					<p class="f4">32. <a id="v314"><span class="f2 c"><b>[314]</b></span></a> The Khattiyas and the Brāhmaṇas and those others who had been protected by their castes, after doing away with their disputes on descent, fell into the power of sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, those wealthy Brāhmaṇas said to Bhagavat as follows:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! As one raises what has been overthrown, or reveals what has been hidden, or tells the way to him who has gone astray, or holds out an oil lamp in the dark that those who have eyes may see the objects, even so by the venerable Gotama in manifold ways the Dhamma has been illustrated; we take refuge in the venerable Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Assembly of Bhikkhus; may the venerable Gotama receive us as followers (upasaka), who from this day for life have taken refuge (in him).'</p>

					<p class="f4">'O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhu speaks well-spoken (language), not ill-spoken; he speaks what is right (dhamma), not what is unrighteous (adhamma); he speaks what is pleasing, not what is unpleasing; he speaks what is true, not what is false.

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Vangisa, rising from his seat, throwing his robe over one shoulder and bending his joined hands towards Bhagavat, said this: 'It occurs to me, O Sugata!'</p>

					<p class="ctr">Buddha shows to Sundarikabhāradvāga on whom to bestow oblations, and the Brāmaṇa is finally converted.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt in Kosala on the bank of the river Sundarika. And during that time the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire. Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga, having made offerings to the fire and worshipped the fire, and having risen from his seat, looked about him on all sides towards the four quarters of the globe, saying: 'Who is to enjoy the rest of this oblation?' The Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga saw Bhagavat sitting not far off at the root of a tree, wrapped up head and body; and seeing him he, after taking the rest of the oblation with his left hand and the waterpot with his right hand, went up to Bhagavat. Then Bhagavat, on hearing the footsteps of Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa, uncovered his head. Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga thought: 'This man is shaved, this man is a shaveling,' and he wished to return again from there. Then this came to the mind of Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa: 'Some Brāmaṇas also here are shaved, I think I shall go up and ask him about his descent.' Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga went up to Bhagavat, and having gone up he said this: 'Of what family art thou?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagavat answered Sundarikabhāradvāga, the Brāmaṇa, in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v454"><span class="f2 c"><b>[454]</b></span></a> 'No Brāmaṇa am I, nor a king's son, nor any <a id="pg75"><span class="f2 g"><b>[75]</b></span></a> Vessa; having thoroughly observed the class of common people, I wander about the world reflectingly, possessing nothing.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v456"><span class="f2 c"><b>[456]</b></span></a> Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'Sir, Brāmaṇas together with Brāmaṇas ask truly, Art thou a Brāhmaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Bhagavat: 'If thou sayest, I am a Brāmaṇa, and callest me no Brāmaṇa, then I ask thee about the Sāvittī that consists of three padas and twenty-four syllables<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">5. <a id="v458"><span class="f2 c"><b>[458]</b></span></a> 'Surely his offering will bear fruit,' — so said the Brāmaṇa, — 'because we saw such an accomplished man; for by not seeing such as you, somebody else will enjoy the oblation.'</p>

					<p class="f4">29. <a id="v482"><span class="f2 c"><b>[482]</b></span></a> Sundarikabhāradvāga: 'Good, O Bhagavat, then I should like to know, who will enjoy a gift from one like me, and whom I shall seek at the time of sacrifice (as one worthy of offerings) after having accepted thy doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">30. <a id="v483"><span class="f2 c"><b>[483]</b></span></a> Bhagavat: 'Whosoever has no quarrels, whose mind is untroubled, and who has freed himself from lusts, whose sloth is driven away,</p>

					<p class="f4">31. <a id="v484"><span class="f2 c"><b>[484]</b></span></a> 'Whosoever conquers his sins, knows birth and death, the Muni who is endowed with wisdom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span>, such a one who has resorted to offering,</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga said this to Bhagavat: 'It is excellent, O venerable Gotama! It is excellent, O venerable Gotama!

					<p class="f4">The Brāmaṇa Sundarikabhāradvāga received the pabbagga from Bhagavat, and he received also the upasampada; and the venerable Bhāradvāga, having lately received the upasampada, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Bhāradvāga became one of the arahats.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Buddha on being asked tells Māgha of those worthy of offerings and the blessing of offering.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Rāgagaha, in the mountain (called) the Vulture's Peak (Gigghakuta).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the young man Māgha went to Bhagavat, and having gone to him he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant, remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart the young man Māgha spoke this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> 'O venerable Gotama, I am a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of; justly I seek for riches, and having sought for riches justly, I give out of the justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, I give still more. (I should like to know), O venerable Gotama, whether I, while so giving, so offering, produce much good.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Certainly, O young man, dost thou in so offering produce much good; he, O young man, who is a liberal giver, bountiful, suitable to beg of, and who justly seeks for riches, and having sought for riches justly, gives out of his justly obtained and justly acquired riches to one, to two, to three, to four, to five, to six, to seven, to eight, to nine, to ten, to twenty, to thirty, to forty, to fifty, to a hundred, and gives still more, produces much good.'</p>

					<p class="ctr">[<a href="../../../../dhamma-vinaya/pali/kd/snp/kd.snp.pali.bd.htm#III.6">pali</a>]</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, goes to the six famous teachers of his time to have his questions answered, but not having his doubts solved, he repairs to Gotama and asks him how one is to behave to become a Brāmaṇa, a Samaṇa, a Nahātaka, a Khettagina, a Kusala, a Paṇḍita, a Muni, a Vedagū, an Anuvidita, a Dhīra, an Āgāniya, a Sottiya, an Ariya, a Karaṇavat, a Paribbāgaka. Bhagavat answers his questions, and Sabhiya finally receives the robe and the orders from Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Rāgagaha, in Veḷuvana, in Kalandakanivāpa. And at that time questions were recited to Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka <a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> (wandering mendicant), by an old benevolent deity: 'He who, O Sabhiya, be it a Samaṇa or a Brāmaṇa, explains these questions to thee when asked, near him thou shouldst live a religious life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, having learnt the questions from that deity, went to whatever Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas there were that had an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and were well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta. Those he went to, and after going to them, he asked the questions. They, being asked the questions by Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding, they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Whatever Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas there are that have an assembly (of Bhikkhus), a crowd (of followers), and are well-known teachers, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; surely I think I shall go back to what I have left, and enjoy sensual pleasures.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'This Samaṇa Gotama has both an <a id="pg87"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></a> assembly (of Bhikkhus) and a crowd (of followers), and is a well-known teacher, a famous leader, considered excellent by the multitude, surely I think I shall go to Samaṇa Gotama and ask these questions.' Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Whatever Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas there are that are decayed, old, aged, advanced in years, having reached old age, experienced elders, long ordained, having assemblies (of Bhikkhus), crowds (of followers), being teachers well-known, famous leaders, considered excellent by the multitude, as Pūraṇa-Kassapa, Makkhali-Gosāla, Agita-Kesakambali, Pakudha-Kakkāyana, Sañgaya-Belaṭṭhiputta, and Niganṭha-Nātaputta, they, being asked questions by me, did not succeed (in answering them), and not succeeding they showed wrath and hatred and discontent, and they also in return put questions to me in this matter; (I should like to know) whether Samaṇa Gotama being asked these questions will be able to explain them to me, for Samaṇa Gotama is both young by birth and new in ascetic life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'Samaṇa Gotama is not to be slighted because he is young; even if the Samaṇa is young, yet he is mighty and powerful; surely I think I shall go to Samaṇa Gotama and ask these questions.' Then Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, went on a journey to Rāgagaha, and wandering on his journey in regular order he came to Rāgagaha, Veḷuvana, Kalandakanivāpa, to Bhagavat, and having come to Bhagavat he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart; sitting down apart <a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, spoke to Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p class="f4">1. <a id="v510"><span class="f2 c"><b>[510]</b></span></a> 'Anxious and doubtful I have come,' — so said Sabhiya, — 'longing to ask questions. Do thou put an end to these (doubts when) asked these questions by me, in regular order, and rightly explain them to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">2. <a id="v511"><span class="f2 c"><b>[511]</b></span></a> 'Thou hast come from afar, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'longing to ask questions; I shall put an end to those (doubts when) asked those questions by thee, in regular order, and rightly I shall explain them to thee.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v512"><span class="f2 c"><b>[512]</b></span></a> 'Ask me, O Sabhiya, a question; whatsoever thou wishest in thy mind that question I (will explain, and) put an end to (thy doubt).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this came to the mind of Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka: 'It is marvellous, it is wonderful indeed, the reception which I did not get from other Samaṇas and Brāhmaṇas has been given me by Gotama,' so saying he glad, rejoicing, delighted, and highly elated asked Bhagavat a question:</p>

					<p class="f4">4. <a id="v513"><span class="f2 c"><b>[513]</b></span></a> 'What should a man (necessarily) have obtained that people may call him a Bhikkhu?' — so said Sabhiya, — 'how may they call him compassionate, and how subdued? how can he be called enlightened (buddha)?

					<p class="f4">5. <a id="v514"><span class="f2 c"><b>[514]</b></span></a> 'He who by the path he has himself made, O Sabhiya,' — so said Bhagavat, — 'has attained to perfect happiness, who has conquered doubt, who lives after having left behind both gain and goods, who has destroyed re-birth, he is a Bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="f4">6. <a id="v515"><span class="f2 c"><b>[515]</b></span></a> 'Always resigned and attentive, he will not hurt any one in all the world, the Samaṇa who has <a id="pg89"><span class="f2 g"><b>[89]</b></span></a> crossed the stream (of existence, and is) untroubled; for whom there are no desires (ussada), he is compassionate.</p>

					<p class="f4">Sabhiya, the Paribbāgaka, received the robe and the orders from Bhagavat, and the venerable Sabhiya, having lately received the upasampada, leading a solitary, retired, strenuous, ardent, energetic life, lived after having in a short time in this existence by his own understanding ascertained and possessed himself of that highest perfection of a religious life for the sake of which men of good family rightly wander away from their houses to a houseless state. 'Birth had been destroyed, a religious life had been led, what was to be done had been done, there was nothing else (to be done) for this existence,' so he perceived, and the venerable Sabhiya became one of the saints.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, invites Buddha with his assembly to take his meals with him on the morrow. Sela, the Brāmaṇa, arrived at that place with his three hundred young men; seeing the preparations he asks what is going on, and is answered that Buddha is expected the next day. On hearing the word 'Buddha,' Sela asks where Buddha lives, goes to him, converses with him, and is converted; so are his followers.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa, with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, went to Āpaṇa, a town in Aṇguttarāpa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Keṇiya, the ascetic, with matted hair (Gaṭila) heard the following: 'The Samaṇa, the venerable Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the family of the Sakyas, wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, with 1250 Bhikkhus, has reached Āpaṇa, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (viggākaraṇa), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious; he teaches this world and the world of gods, of Māras, of Brahmans, and beings comprising Samaṇas and Brāmaṇas, gods and men, having himself known and seen them face to face; he teaches the Dhamma (which is) good in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, is full of meaning and rich in words, quite complete; he teaches a religious life, and good is the sight of such saints."'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, went (to the place) where <a id="pg97"><span class="f2 g"><b>[97]</b></span></a> Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with him, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) he sat down apart; and while Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was sitting down apart, Bhagavat, by religious talk, taught, advised, roused, and delighted him. Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, having been taught, advised, roused, and delighted by Bhagavat through religious talk, said this to Bhagavat:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Gotama accept my food tomorrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Bhagavat answered Keṇiya, the Gaṭila: 'Large, O Keṇiya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Brāmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Brāmaṇas, let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Bhagavat said this to Keṇiya, the Gaṭila: 'Large, O Keṇiya, is the assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and thou art intimate with the Brāmaṇas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, said this to Bhagavat: 'Although, O venerable Gotama, the assembly of Bhikkhus is large, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, and I am intimate with the Brāhmaṇas, yet let the venerable Gotama accept my food to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus.' Bhagavat assented by being silent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg98"><span class="f2 g"><b>[98]</b></span></a> Then Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, having learnt the assent of Bhagavat, after rising from his seat went to his hermitage, and having gone there he addressed his friends and servants, his relatives and kinsmen (as follows): 'Let my venerable friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen hear me; — the Samaṇa Gotama has been invited by me to (take his) food (with me) to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus; wherefore you must render me bodily service.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Surely, O venerable one,' so saying the friends and servants, relatives and kinsmen of Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, complying with his request, some of them dug fireplaces, some chopped firewood, some washed the vessels, some placed waterpots, some prepared seats. Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, on the other hand, himself provided a circular pavilion.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Brāmaṇa Sela lived at Āpaṇa, perfect in the three Vedas, vocabulary, Keṭubha, etymology, Itihāsa as the fifth (Veda), versed in metre, a grammarian, one not deficient in popular controversy and the signs of a great man, he taught three hundred young men the hymns.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn65" href="#n65">65</a>]</sup></span> At that time Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was intimate with the Brāhmaṇa Sela. Then the Brāmaṇa Sela surrounded by three hundred young men, walking on foot, arrived at the place where the hermitage of Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, was. And the Brāmaṇa Sela saw the Gaṭilas in Keṇiya's hermitage, some of them digging fireplaces, some chopping firewood, some washing the vessels, some placing waterpots, some <a id="pg99"><span class="f2 g"><b>[99]</b></span></a> preparing seats, and Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, on the other hand, himself providing a circular pavilion; seeing Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, he said this: 'Is the venerable Keṇiya to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, or is there a great sacrifice at hand, or has Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am not to celebrate the marriage of a son or the marriage of a daughter, nor has Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, who has a large body of troops, been invited for to-morrow, together with his army, yet a great sacrifice of mine is at hand. The Samaṇa Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, wandering about in Aṇguttarāpa with a large assembly of Bhikkhus, one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus, has reached Āpaṇa, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the perfectly enlightened, endowed with science and works (viggākaraṇa), the happy, knowing the world, the incomparable, the charioteer of men that are to be subdued, the master, the enlightened of gods and men, the glorious, he has been invited by me for to-morrow, together with the assembly of Bhikkhus."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Didst thou say that he is a Buddha, O venerable Keṇiya?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, I say, O venerable Sela, that he is a Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Didst thou say that he is a Buddha, O venerable Keṇiya?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, I say, O venerable Sela, that he is a Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to the Brāhmaṇa Sela: 'This sound "Buddha" is (indeed) rare, but in our hymns <a id="pg100"><span class="f2 g"><b>[100]</b></span></a> are to be found the thirty-two signs of a great man, and for a great man endowed with these there are two conditions, and no more: if he lives in a house he is a king, a universal (king), a just religious king, a lord of the four-cornered (earth), a conqueror, one who has obtained the security of his people (and) is possessed of the seven gems. These are his seven gems, namely, the wheel gem, the elephant gem, the horse gem, the pearl gem, the woman gem, the householder gem, and the chief gem as the seventh. He has more than a thousand sons, heroes, possessing great bodily strength and crushing foreign armies; he having conquered this ocean-girt earth without a rod and without a weapon, but by justice, lives (in a house). But if, on the other hand, he goes out from (his) house to the houseless state, he becomes a saint, a perfectly enlightened, one who has removed the veil in the world. And where, O venerable Keṇiya, dwells now that venerable Gotama, the saint and the perfectly enlightened?'</p>

					<p class="f4">This having been said, Keṇiya, the Gaṭila, stretching out his right arm, spoke as follows to the Brāmaṇa Sela: 'There, where yon blue forest line is, O venerable Sela.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sela together with (his) three hundred young men went to the place where Bhagavat was. Then the Brāmaṇa Sela addressed those young men: 'Come ye, venerable ones, with but little noise, walking step by step, for Bhagavats are difficult of access, walking alone like lions, and when I speak to the venerable Samaṇa Gotama, do ye not utter interrupting words, but wait ye venerable ones, for the end of my speech.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Brāmaṇa Sela went to the place where <a id="pg101"><span class="f2 g"><b>[101]</b></span></a> Bhagavat was, and having gone there he talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation with him he sat down apart, and while sitting down apart Sela, the Brāhmaṇa, looked for the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat. And the Brāmaṇa Sela saw the thirty-two signs of a great man on the body of Bhagavat with the exception of two; in respect to two of the signs of a great man he had doubts, he hesitated, he was not satisfied, he was not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane and as to his having a large tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to Bhagavat: 'This Brāmaṇa Sela sees in me the thirty-two signs of a great man with the exception of two, in respect to two of the signs of a great man he has doubts, he hesitates, he is not satisfied, he is not assured as to the member being enclosed in a membrane, and as to my having a large tongue.' Then Bhagavat created such a miraculous creature that the Brāmaṇa Sela might see Bhagavat's member enclosed in a membrane. Then Bhagavat having put out his tongue touched and stroked both his ears, touched and stroked both nostrils, and the whole circumference of his forehead he covered with his tongue.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this occurred to the Brāhmaṇa Sela: 'The Samaṇa Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two signs of a great man, with them all, not with (only) some of them, and yet I do not know whether he is a Buddha or not; I have heard old and aged Brāhmaṇas, teachers and their previous teachers, say that those who are saints and perfectly enlightened manifest themselves when their praise is uttered. I think I shall praise the Samaṇa Gotama face to <a id="pg102"><span class="f2 g"><b>[102]</b></span></a> face in suitable stanzas.' Then the Brāmaṇa Sela praised Bhagavat face to face in suitable stanzas:</p>

					<p class="ctr">A dispute arose between two young men, Bhāradvāga and Vāseṭṭha, the former contending man to be a Brāmaṇa by birth, the latter by deeds. They agreed to go and ask Samaṇa Gotama, and he answered that man is a Brāmaṇa by his work only. The two young men are converted. — Text (from <i>Magghimanikāya</i>) and translation in Alwis's <i>Buddhist Nirvāna,</i> p. 103.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Ikkhānaɱkala, in the Ikkhānaɱkala forest. At that time many distinguished, <a id="pg109"><span class="f2 g"><b>[109]</b></span></a> wealthy Brāmaṇas lived at Ikkhānaɱkala, as the Brāmaṇa Kaɱkin, the Brāmaṇa Tārukkha, the Brāmaṇa Pokkharasāti, the Brāhmaṇa Gānussoṇi, the Brāmaṇa Todeyya, and other distinguished, wealthy Brāmaṇas.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then this dialogue arose between the young men Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāga while walking about:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How does one become a Brāmaṇa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The young man Bhāradvāga said: 'When one is noble by birth on both sides, on the mother's and on the father's side, of pure conception up to the seventh generation of ancestors, not discarded and not reproached in point of birth, in this way one is a Brāmaṇa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The young man Vāseṭṭha said: 'When one is virtuous and endowed with (holy) works, in this way he is a Brāmaṇa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Neither could the young man Bhāradvāga convince the young man Vāseṭṭha, nor could the young man Vāseṭṭha convince the young man Bhāradvāga. Then the young man Vāseṭṭha addressed the young man Bhāradvāga: 'O Bhāradvāga, this Samaṇa Gotama, the Sakya son, gone out from the Sakya family, dwells at Ikkhānaɱkala, in the forest of Ikkhānaɱkala, and the following good praising words met the venerable Gotama: "And so he is Bhagavat, the venerable, the enlightened, the glorious, let us go, O venerable Bhāradvāga, let us go (to the place) where the Samaṇa Gotama is, and having gone there let us ask the Samaṇa Gotama about this matter, and as the Samaṇa Gotama replies so will we understand it."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, O venerable one;' so the young man Bhāradvāga answered the young man Vāseṭṭha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg110"><span class="f2 g"><b>[110]</b></span></a> Then the young men Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāga went (to the place) where Bhagavat was, and having gone, they talked pleasantly with Bhagavat, and after having had some pleasant and remarkable conversation (with him) they sat down apart. Sitting down apart the young man Vāseṭṭha addressed Bhagavat in stanzas:</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="ctr">Kokāliya abuses Sāriputta and Moggallāna to Buddha; therefore as soon as he has left Buddha, he is struck with boils, dies and goes to the Paduma hell, whereupon Buddha describes to the Bhikkhus the punishment of backbiters in hell.</p>

					<p class="f4">So it was heard by me:</p>

					<p class="f4">At one time Bhagavat dwelt at Sāvatthī, in Getavana, in the park of Anāthapiṇḍika. Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya approached Bhagavat, and after having approached and saluted Bhagavat he sat down apart; sitting down apart the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, Bhagavat spoke to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya as follows: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn80" href="#n80">80</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">A second time the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy, yet Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, they have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A second time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time the Bhikkhu Kokāliya said this to Bhagavat: 'Although thou, O venerable Bhagavat, (appearest) to me (to be) faithful and trustworthy, <a id="pg119"><span class="f2 g"><b>[119]</b></span></a> yet Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have fallen into the power of evil desires.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A third time Bhagavat said this to the Bhikkhu Kokāliya: '(Do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; (do) not (say) so, Kokāliya; appease, O Kokāliya, (thy) mind in regard to Sāriputta and Moggallāna: Sāriputta and Moggallāna are amiable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya, after having risen from his seat and saluted Bhagavat and walked round him towards the right, went away; and when he had been gone a short time, all his body was struck with boils as large as mustard seeds; after being only as large as mustard seeds, they became as large as kidney beans; after being only as large as kidney beans, they became as large as chick peas; after being only as large as chick peas, they became as large as a Kolatthi egg (?); after being only as large as a Kolatthi egg, they became as large as the jujube fruit; after being only as large as the jujube fruit, they became as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan; after being only as large as the fruit of the emblic myrobalan, they became as large as the unripe beluva fruit; after being only as large as the unripe beluva fruit, they became as large as a billi fruit (?); after being as large as a billi fruit, they broke, and matter and blood flowed out. Then the Bhikkhu Kokāliya died of that disease, and when he had died the Bhikkhu Kokāliya went to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Then when the night had passed Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all Getavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat, <a id="pg120"><span class="f2 g"><b>[120]</b></span></a> he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: 'O thou venerable one, Kokāliya, the Bhikkhu, is dead and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.'</p>

					<p class="f4">This said Brahman Sahampati, and after saying this and saluting Bhagavat, and walking round him towards the right, he disappeared there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Bhagavat, after the expiration of that night, addressed the Bhikkhus thus: 'Last night, O Bhikkhus, when the night had (nearly) passed, Brahman Sahampati of a beautiful appearance, having lit up all Getavana, approached Bhagavat, and having approached and saluted Bhagavat, he stood apart, and standing apart Brahman Sahampati said this to Bhagavat: "O thou venerable one, Kokāliya, the Bhikkhu, is dead; and after death, O thou venerable one, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone to the Paduma hell, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna." This said Brahman Sahampati, O Bhikkhus, and having said this and saluted me, and walked round me towards the right, he disappeared there.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When this had been said, a Bhikkhu asked Bhagavat: 'How long is the rate of life, O venerable one, in the Paduma hell?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Long, O Bhikkhu, is the rate of life in the Paduma hell, it is not easy to calculate either (by saying) so many years or so many hundreds of years or so many thousands of years or so many hundred thousands of years.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg121"><span class="f2 g"><b>[121]</b></span></a> 'It is possible, O Bhikkhu;' so saying, Bhagavat spoke (as follows): 'Even as, O Bhikkhu, (if there were) a Kosala load of sesamum seed containing twenty kharis, and a man after the lapse of every hundred years were to take from it one sesamum seed at a time, then that Kosala load of sesamum seed, containing twenty kharis, would, O Bhikkhu, sooner by this means dwindle away and be used up than one Abbuda hell; and even as are twenty Abbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Nirabbuda hell; and even as are twenty Nirabbuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ababa hell; and even as are twenty Ababa hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Ahaha hell; and even as are twenty Ahaha hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Aṭaṭa hell; and even as are twenty Aṭaṭa hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Kumuda hell; and even as are twenty Kumuda hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Sogandhika hell; and even as are twenty Sogandhika hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Uppalaka hell; and even as are twenty Uppalaka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Puṇḍarīka hell; and even as are twenty Puṇḍarīka hells, O Bhikkhu, so is one Paduma hell; and to the Paduma hell, O Bhikkhu, the Bhikkhu Kokāliya is gone, having shown a hostile mind against Sāriputta and Moggallāna.'

					<p class="f4">3. <a id="v880"><span class="f2 c"><b>[880]</b></span></a> He who does not acknowledge an opponent's doctrine (dhamma), he is a fool, a beast, one of poor understanding, all are fools with a very poor understanding; all these abide by their (own) views.</p>

					<p class="ctr">Philosophers cannot lead to purity, they only praise themselves and stigmatise others. But a Brāhmaṇa has overcome all dispute, he is indifferent to learning, he is appeased.</p>

A deity comforts Bāvarī by referring him to Buddha. Then Bāvarī sends his sixteen disciples to Buddha, and each of thern asks Buddha a question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> From v. 456 we see that Buddha has rightly read <i>vareṇiyam</i> as the metre requires; but I must not omit to mention that the Commentator understands by Sāvittī the Buddhistic formula: <i>Buddhaɱ saraṇaɱ gakkhāmi, Dhammaɱ saraṇaɱ gakkhāmi, Saŋghaɱ saraṇaɱ gakkhāmi,</i> which, like Sāvitti, contains twenty-four syllables.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Besides the religious Brāhmaṇas some secular Brāhmaṇas are mentioned, p. 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Buddha is sometimes styled the great <i>Isi,</i> vv. 1060, 1082; sometimes a <i>Muni,</i> vv. 164, 700; sometimes a <i>Brāhmaṇa,</i> v. 1064; sometimes a <i>Bhikkhu,</i> vv. 411, 415; and all these appellations are used synonymously, vv. 283, 284, 1064, 1056, 843, 844, 911, 912, 946, 220. Ascetic life is praised throughout the book, especially in the <i>Uraga-, Muni-, Rāhula-, Sammāparibbāganiya-, Dhammika-, Nālaka-, Purābheda-, Tuvaṭaka-, Attadaṇḍa-,</i> and <i>Sāriputta-suttas</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This system ends, it will be seen from this, like other ascetic systems, in mysticism.</p>

Piŋgiya, who sat picturing Buddha's virtues to Bāvarī, having seen the light, looked round, saying, 'What is this?' And when he saw Bhagavat standing, as it were, before him, he said to the Brāhmaṇa Bāvarī: 'Buddha has come.' The Brāhmaṇa rose from his seat and stood with folded hands. Bhagavat, shedding a light, showed himself to the Brāhmaṇa, and knowing what was beneficial for both, he said this stanza while addressing Piŋgiya. Commentator.</p>
