					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the Blessed One was staying at <i>G</i>etavana, in the grove of Anātha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and of Lohitaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>,--who themselves were makers of strife, quarrelsome<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, makers of disputes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, given to idle talk, and raisers of legal questions in the Saŋgha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>,--used to go up to such other Bhikkhus as were the same, and say, 'Do not allow such a one, venerable Sirs, to turn you back. Discuss loud and long. You are indeed cleverer, more wise, more well informed, more able at that (than <a id="pg330"><span class="f2 g"><b>[330]</b></span></a> your adversaries are) and do not you be afraid of them. We too will be on your side.' Thereby both disputes arose which had not arisen before; and disputes which had arisen grew hotter.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Those Bhikkhus who were modest were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, How can the Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and of Lohitaka act thus.' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Order of Bhikkhus, and inquired of the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, as they say, Bhikkhus, that those Bhikkhus who are followers of Pa<i>n</i><i>d</i>uka and Lohitaka,--who themselves (&amp;c., as in §1, down to the end)?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper, O Bhikkhus, for those foolish persons, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, who themselves (&amp;c., as in §1, down to the end). This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted being not converted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> And when the Blessed One had rebuked those Bhikkhus in various ways,--speaking of the evils of being hard to satisfy in the matter of support or nourishment, of wishing for much, of discontent, of love of society, and of sloth; and speaking in praise of being easy to satisfy in the matter of support and nourishment, of wishing for little, of the <a id="pg331"><span class="f2 g"><b>[331]</b></span></a> contented man who has eradicated (evils from his mind), has quelled his passions<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>, and is full of faith, of reverence, and of the exercise of zeal,--when he had thus held a religious discourse to the Bhikkhus as to what was fit and suitable in that respect, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let the Saŋgha, therefore, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-kamma (Act of Rebuke) against those Bhikkhus.</p>

And that Bhikkhu in the early morning put on his under garment, and went, duly bowled and robed, to the Ki<i>t</i>ā Hill for alms. And he was perfect in dignity, with his eyes cast down, and pleasing in appearance, whether in going in or <a id="pg350"><span class="f2 g"><b>[350]</b></span></a> in coming out, in looking or in watching, in bending in his arm or in stretching it forth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the people on beholding that Bhikkhu, said, 'Who is this fellow like a fool of fools, or like an idiot of idiots, or like a simpleton of simpletons<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span>? Who would give an alms when this fellow comes near! Now our own masters, the followers of Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu, are gentle, friendly, pleasant in speech, radiant with smiles, by no means fools, but open in countenance, and the first to speak. To such now it is fit to give an alms!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain lay-disciple saw that Bhikkhu as he was going along the Ki<i>t</i>ā Hill for alms. And on seeing him, he went up to the place where he was; and on coming there he said to that Bhikkhu:</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, my friend, I have received no alms!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, your reverence! Let us go to my house!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.4">13.4</a> So the lay-disciple took the Bhikkhu to his house, and gave him to eat, and asked him: 'Whither then is your reverence going?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then let your reverence bow down at the feet of the Blessed One in my name, and say, "The residence on the Ki<i>t</i>ā Hill, Lord, has been spoiled.

Such as these are the <a id="pg351"><span class="f2 g"><b>[351]</b></span></a> evil practices they follow (&amp;c., as in §§1, 2, down to the end). And people, Lord, who were formerly believers and full of faith, are now become non-believers and void of faith; the opportunities of alms that were formerly open to the Saŋgha are now destroyed; worthy Bhikkhus forsake, and wicked Bhikkhus dwell in the place. Let, Lord, the Blessed One be pleased to send (other) Bhikkhus to the Ki<i>t</i>ā Hill in order that the residence there may be re-established."'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.5">13.5</a> 'Very well, my friend,' said the Bhikkhu, in assent, to that lay-disciple.

And on arriving there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is the custom for the Blessed Buddhas to exchange words of greeting with in-coming Bhikkhus.

And whence, O Bhikkhu, have you come?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Things go well with me, Lord. I have enough for my support. And I have accomplished my journey without too much fatigue.

And a certain lay-disciple saw me (&amp;c., as above, down to the end of §4, with the alterations necessary to <a id="pg352"><span class="f2 g"><b>[352]</b></span></a> the narrative form of speech).

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.6">13.6</a> Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-Saŋgha, and asked the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can they, O Bhikkhus, foolish persons that they are, follow such practices as these (&amp;c., as in §§1, 2, down to the end)?

					<p class="f4">And when the Blessed Buddha had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the venerable Sāriputta and Moggallāna, and said, 'Go now, Sāriputta and Moggallāna<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span>, to the Ki<i>t</i>ā Hill.

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of the Thera Bhikkhus, including the venerable Sāriputta, and the venerable Mahā Moggallāna, and the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āna, and the venerable Mahā Ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>ita, and the venerable Mahā Kappina, and the venerable Mahā <i>K</i>unda, and <a id="pg360"><span class="f2 g"><b>[360]</b></span></a> the venerable Anuruddha, and the venerable Revata, and the venerable Upāli, and the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and the venerable Rāhula, as they were journeying through the country of Kāsi, arrived at Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ikāsa<i>n</i><i>d</i>a. And <i>K</i>itta the householder heard the news that the Thera Bhikkhus had arrived at Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ikāsa<i>n</i><i>d</i>a.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>K</i>itta the householder went up to the place where the Thera Bhikkhus were, and on arriving there, he saluted the Thera Bhikkhus, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable Sāriputta taught <i>K</i>itta the householder, and incited him, and roused him, and gladdened him with religious discourse. And <i>K</i>itta the householder, having been thus taught, and incited, and roused, and gladdened with religious discourse, said to the Thera Bhikkhus, 'May the venerable Theras consent to take their to-morrow's meal, as incoming Bhikkhus, at my house.' And the Thera Bhikkhus signified, by silence, their consent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p18.2">18.2</a>Then perceiving that the Thera Bhikkhus had given their consent, <i>K</i>itta the householder rose from his seat, and bowed down before the Thera Bhikkhus, and keeping them on his right hand as he passed them, went on to the place where the venerable Sudhamma was. And on arriving there, he saluted the venerable Sudhamma, and stood by on one side. And so standing, <i>K</i>itta the householder said to the venerable Sudhamma: 'May the venerable Sudhamma consent to take his to-morrow's meal at my house with the Theras.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Sudhamma, thinking, 'Formerly indeed this <i>K</i>itta the householder, whenever he wished to give an invitation to the Saŋgha, or to <a id="pg361"><span class="f2 g"><b>[361]</b></span></a> four or five Bhikkhus, or to a single one, used not to invite them without making special mention of me; but now he has invited the Thera Bhikkhus without regarding me. This <i>K</i>itta the householder is now incensed against me, unfavourable to me, takes pleasure in me no longer.' And so thinking he refused, saying, 'It is enough, O householder.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time <i>K</i>itta the householder said to the venerable Sudhamma (&amp;c., as before, with the same result). And a third time (&amp;c., as before, with the same result).</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>K</i>itta the householder, thinking, 'What can the venerable Sudhamma do against me, whether he consents, or whether he does not consent,' saluted the venerable Sudhamma, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p18.3">18.3</a>And at the end of the night <i>K</i>itta the householder made ready sweet food, both hard and soft, for the Thera Bhikkhus. And the venerable Sudhamma, thinking, 'I may as well go and see what <i>K</i>itta the householder has made ready for the Thera Bhikkhus,' robed himself early in the morning, and went, duly bowled and robed, to the place where <i>K</i>itta the householder dwelt; and, on arriving there, he took his seat on a mat spread out for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>K</i>itta the householder went up to the place where the venerable Sudhamma was; and after he had come there, he saluted the venerable Sudhamma, and took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the venerable Sudhamma addressed <i>K</i>itta the householder, and said: 'Though this great store of sweet food, both hard and soft, has been made ready by you, O householder, there is one thing yet wanting, that is to say, tila seed cake.</p>

					<p class="f4">'<a id="pg362"><span class="f2 g"><b>[362]</b></span></a> Though then, Sir, there is so much treasure in the ward of the Buddhas, yet there is but one thing of which the venerable Sudhamma makes mention, and that is tila seed cake. Long ago, Sir, certain merchants of Dakkhi<i>n</i>āpatha went, for the sake of their traffic, to the country of the East, and thence they brought back a hen. Now, Sir, that hen made acquaintance with a crow, and gave birth to a chicken. And, Sir, whenever that chicken tried to utter the cry of a cock it gave vent to a "caw," and whenever it tried to utter the cry of a crow, it gave vent to a "cock-a-doodle-do<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span>." Just even so, Sir, though there is much treasure in the ward of the Buddhas, when-ever the venerable Sudhamma speaks, the sound is "tila seed cake."'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p18.4">18.4</a> 'You are abusing me, householder. You are finding fault with me, householder. This place, householder, is yours. I must go away from it,' said the venerable Sudhamma.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not intend, Sir, to abuse the venerable Sudhamma, nor to find fault with him. Let, Sir, the venerable Sudhamma still dwell at Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ikāsa<i>n</i><i>d</i>a. Pleasant is this grove of plum trees, and I shall take good care to, provide the venerable Sudhamma with those things a recluse requires--to wit, with robes and food and lodging and medicine when he is sick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a second time the venerable Sudhamma said: You are abusing me (&amp;c., as before, with the same reply). And a third time the venerable Sudhamma said: 'You are abusing me (&amp;c., as before, down to) I must go away from it.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg363"><span class="f2 g"><b>[363]</b></span></a> 'Whither then, Sir, will the venerable Sudhamma go?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall go to Sāvatthi, O householder, to visit the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, Sir, let the Blessed One know all, both what you yourself have said, and what I have said. And I should not, Sir, be surprised if the venerable Sudhamma were to return again even to Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ikāsa<i>n</i><i>d</i>a.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p18.5">18.5</a> So the venerable Sudhamma gathered together his sleeping mat, and set out, with his bowl and his robe, for Sāvatthi. And he journeyed straight on to Sāvatthi, to the <i>G</i>etavana, Anāthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove, to the place where the Blessed One was; and on arriving there he bowed down before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side. And when he was thus seated the venerable Sudhamma informed the Blessed One of all, both that he himself had said, and that <i>K</i>itta the householder had said.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This was improper, O foolish one, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, and ought not to have been done. How is it that you, O foolish one, could put down<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> and could lower by your censure<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span> <i>K</i>itta the householder, he being a man of faith, a believing disciple, and a donor, a provider, and a supporter of the Saŋgha?' This will not conduce, O foolish one, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to the unconverted not being converted, and to the turning back of those who have been <a id="pg364"><span class="f2 g"><b>[364]</b></span></a> converted.' And after he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Let therefore the Saŋgha, O Bhikkhus, carry out the Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya-kamma (Act of Reconciliation)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span> against the Bhikkhu Sudhamma, saying, "You are to ask and obtain pardon of <i>K</i>itta the householder."'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Usse<i>lh</i>enti. We are quite uncertain how to render this word. One might be tempted to think that a denominative verb from usso<i>lh</i>i may have acquired a technical sense appropriate to this passage.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa points out that whereas the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-kamma is directed against quarrelsomeness, and the nissaya-kamma against foolishness, it is scandal to the community against which the Pabbā<i>g</i>aniya-kamma is directed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> The corresponding clause to the words 'to the effect,' &amp;c., is wanting in chap. 1, §4, but occurs in chap. 9, §2.</p>

There is no Rule in the Pātimokkha by which giving offence to a layman, the cause of the proceeding described in the following chapters, is considered worthy of censure.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Navakammiko, not 'newly appointed to an office,' as Dr. Rudolf Hoernle translates in the Indian Antiquary, XI, 29, in dealing with one of the Bharhut Inscriptions. See <i>G</i>ātaka I, 92, and below, V, 13, 3, VI, 5, 2, VI, 17, 1, X, 24, This duty of superintending a new building was even filled by Bhikkhun&icirc;s; see the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pārā<i>g</i>ika I, where the details of the duty are incidentally mentioned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Childers proposes doubtingly to derive the word Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya from the root smar; but that that is impossible is probably sufficiently evident from the meaning of the word, which is quite clear from the context of this, and from the following chapters. Now at p. 530 of the Lalita Vistara the common Pāli phrase sammodan&icirc;ya<i>m</i> katha<i>m</i> sārā<i>n</i>&icirc;ya<i>m</i> v&icirc;tisāretvā is represented by the Sanskrit sammodan&icirc;<i>h</i> sa<i>m</i>ra<i>ñ</i>g.an&icirc;<i>h</i> kathā<i>h</i> k<i>ri</i>tvā. It is by no means impossible that this parallel may offer the true solution of the etymology of the Pāli words in question; (compare Sārāga as equal to sa<i>m</i>rāga, sāratta to sa<i>m</i>rakta, &amp;c. &amp;c.) Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya would then be equal to pratisa<i>m</i>ra<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>an&icirc;ya. See Senart, Mahāvagga, p. 599.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> See above, chapter 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> There is no mention in the Pātimokkha of any such proceeding. At the close of each of the four Pā<i>t</i>idesaniya Rules there is a form of confession to be observed. It would seem from the following chapters, which are nowhere expressly confined to these four cases, that a similar confession was expected after the commission of an offence against any of the Pātimokkha Rules. In the closing words of the Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa Rules, an older proceeding is mentioned, under which an offending Bhikkhu who has not confessed any breach of either of those thirteen Rules is to remain on probation for as many days he has allowed to go by without confessing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> On <i>Kh</i>anna's character, see also below, IV, 14, I, XI, I, 12-14, and Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> On this phrase the Samanta Pāsādikā says, &Acirc;vāsa-parampara<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a bhikkhave sa<i>m</i>sathā ti sabbāvāsesu āro<i>k</i>etha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> As this chapter, containing the sammā-vattanā or right conduct, differs from the corresponding chapters of the preceding Kammas (chapters 5, 10, 15, and 21), it is here set out in full.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> See the passages quoted above (chapter 5).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> The passage between these two figures recurs at II, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> At II, 1, 1. Buddhaghosa explains this word as confined to a stool on which to place feet that have been washed (dhota-pāda-<i>th</i>apanaka<i>m</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says on the same expression in II, 1, 1, pādakathaliyan (sic) ti adhota-pāda-<i>th</i>apanaka<i>m</i> pāda-gha<i>m</i>sana<i>m</i> vā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Na titthiya-dhago ti kusa<i>k</i>&icirc;rādi<i>m</i> na dhāretabba<i>m</i>. Compare the use of arahad-dha<i>g</i>a<i>m</i> at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 65.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Na āsādetabbo ti na pāsādetabbo (compare the use of āsādesi, <i>G</i>ātaka I, 481). Anto vā bahi vā ti vihārassa anto vā bahi vā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> On this and the following sentences compare the passages quoted above, chapter 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> It will be seen from the above chapters, and especially from chapter 27, that the Ukkhepaniya-kamma is an Act, not of expulsion, but only of suspension. The ten cases in which a member of the Order could be expelled are those given above in Mahāvagga I, 60; and the technical word for 'expel' is nāseti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> In his commentary on the Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, quoted by Oldenberg in his note on this passage, Buddhaghosa explains this expression to mean 'born in a family of vulture slayers.' This does not, help us much, vulture slaying as a regular occupation being somewhat incomprehensible, and not referred to elsewhere. Whatever its meaning, the occupation referred to is perhaps the origin of, or should at least be compared with, the statement of Ktesias (circa B.C. 400) in his 'Indika' (ed. C. M&uuml;ller, Fragment xiii), that the Indians used not dogs but vultures, which they trained for that purpose, in hunting hares and foxes. Lassen in his 'Indische Alterthumskunde,' II, 638, 639, thinks this statement not incredible, very fairly comparing the use of falcons in Europe in the Middle Ages. It is not impossible that the correct rendering here should be 'vulture-catcher,' or 'vulture-trainer;' but we prefer to be literal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> The only one of such things (Dhammā) known to us elsewhere in the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka itself is deliberate falsehood. This is stated in Mahāvagga II, 3, 3 to be an impediment, which is explained by the Old Commentator, at Mahāvagga II, 3, 7, to mean an impediment to the attainment of the Ghānas, and other things of similar nature.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> This is word for word the same speech as that which is condemned in the 68th and 70th Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Byā is only known to us as an intensive particle occurring in passages like the present one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> So far this section is word for word the same as the 68th and the 70th Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> Quoted at Dhammapada, ver. 186.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> <i>G</i>ātaka I, 231, 232.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> Compare Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta IV, 8-11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> Up to this point the whole chapter recurs as the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on the 68th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>
