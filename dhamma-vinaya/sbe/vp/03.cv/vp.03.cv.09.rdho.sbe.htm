					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p1">1</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthi, in the Eastern &Acirc;rāma, the mansion of the mother of Migāra. And at that time, it being Uposatha Day, the Blessed One was seated in the midst of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. And the venerable &Acirc;nanda, when the night was far spent, when the first watch was passing away, arose from his seat, arranged his robe over one shoulder, and stretching out his joined hands towards the Blessed One, said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The night, Lord, is far spent. The first watch is passing away. For a long time has the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha been seated here. Let my lord the Blessed One recite to the Bhikkhus the Pātimokkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, the Blessed One remained silent. And a second time, when the second watch was passing away [he made the same request with the same result]. And a third time, when the third watch had begun, and the dawn was breaking<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> he made the same request].</p>

					<p class="f4">The assembly, &Acirc;nanda, is not pure<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg300"><span class="f2 g"><b>[300]</b></span></a> <a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna thought, 'What individual can the Blessed One be referring to in that he says, "The assembly, &Acirc;nanda, is not pure."' And the venerable Mahā Moggallāna considered the whole Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, penetrating their minds with his. Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna perceived who was that individual,--evil in conduct, wicked in character, of impure and doubtful<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> behaviour, not a Sama<i>n</i>a though he had taken the vows of one, not a religious student though he had taken the vows of one, foul within, full of cravings, a worthless creature,--who had taken his seat amongst the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha. On perceiving which it was, he went up to that individual, and said to him, 'Arise, Sir! The Blessed One has found you out. There can be no communion<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span> between you and the Bhikkhus!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had thus spoken, that man kept silence. And a second and a third time the venerable Mahā Moggallāna addressed to him [the same words, and with the same result]. Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna took that man by the arm and made him go out beyond the porch<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>, and bolted the door, <a id="pg301"><span class="f2 g"><b>[301]</b></span></a> and went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and said to him, 'Lord, I have made that man go out. The assembly is now undefiled. May my lord the Blessed One recite the Pātimokkha to the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How astonishing and curious a thing it is, Moggallāna, that that foolish fellow should have waited up to the very point when he had to be taken by the arm.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> And the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus: 'There are, O Bhikkhus, in the great ocean, then, eight astonishing and curious qualities, by the constant perception of which the mighty creatures take delight in the great ocean. And what are the eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">'The great ocean, O Bhikkhus, gets gradually deeper, slope following on slope, hollow succeeding hollow, and the fall is not precipitously abrupt<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>. This is the first [of such qualities]<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, &Ocirc; Bhikkhus, the great ocean remains of the same nature<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>, and passes not beyond the shore. This is the second [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean will not brook association with a dead corpse. Whatsoever dead corpse there be in the sea, that will it--and quickly--draw to the shore, and cast it out on the dry ground<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>. This is the third [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, all the great rivers--that is to say, the Gaṅgā, the Yamunā, the A<i>k</i>iravat&icirc;, the <a id="pg302"><span class="f2 g"><b>[302]</b></span></a> Sarabh&ucirc;, and the Mah&icirc;--they, when they have fallen into the great ocean, renounce their names and lineage, and are reckoned thenceforth as the great ocean. This is the fourth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, though all the streams in the world flow on till they reach the great ocean, and all <i>th</i>e waters of the sky fall into it, yet does it not thereby seem to be the more empty or more full. This is the fifth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt. This is the sixth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean is full of gems, of gems of various kinds; among which are these gems--that is to say, the pearl, the diamond, the catseye, the chank, rock, coral, silver, gold, the ruby, and the cornelian<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>. This is the seventh [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, the great ocean is the dwelling-place of mighty beings, among which are these--that is to say, the Timi, the Timiṅgala, the Timitimiṅgala, the Asuras, the Nāgas, and the Gandhabbas. There are in the great ocean creatures so constituted that they stretch from one to five hundred leagues<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>. This is the eighth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> 'And just in the same way, O Bhikkhus, there are in this doctrine and discipline eight marvellous and wonderful qualities, by the constant perception <a id="pg303"><span class="f2 g"><b>[303]</b></span></a> of which the Bhikkhus take delight in this doctrine and discipline. What are the eight?</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean gets gradually deeper, slope following on slope, hollow succeeding hollow, and the fall is not precipitately abrupt just so, O Bhikkhus, in this doctrine and discipline is the training a gradual one, work following on work, and step succeeding step; and there is no sudden attainment to the insight (of Arahatship)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>. This is the first [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean remains of the same nature, and passes not beyond the shore--just so, O Bhikkhus, is the body of precepts which I have established for those who are hearers of my word, and which they, their lives long, do not pass beyond. This is the second [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean will not brook association with a dead corpse; but whatsoever dead corpse there be in the sea that will it--and quickly--draw to the shore, and cast it out upon the dry land just so, O Bhikkhus, if there be any individual evil in conduct, wicked in character, of impure and doubtful behaviour, not a Sama<i>n</i>a though he have taken the vows of one, not a religious student though he have taken the vows of one, foul within, full of cravings, a worthless creature; with him will the Saṅgha brook no association, but quickly, on its meeting together, will it cast him out. And what though that man should himself be seated in the midst of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, verily, both is he afar off from the Saṅgha, <a id="pg304"><span class="f2 g"><b>[304]</b></span></a> and the Saṅgha from him. This is the third (of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great rivers--that is to say, the Gaṅgā, the Yamunā, the A<i>k</i>iravat&icirc;, the Sarabh&ucirc;, and the Mah&icirc;--when they have fallen into the great ocean, renounce their name and lineage and are thenceforth reckoned as the great ocean just so, O Bhikkhus, do these four castes--the Khattiyas, the Brahmans, the Vessas, and the Suddas--when they have gone forth from the world under the doctrine and discipline proclaimed by the Tathāgata, renounce their names and lineage, and enter into the number of the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as. This is the fourth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as though all the streams in the world flow on till they reach the great ocean, and all the waters of the sky fall into it, yet does it not seem thereby to be either more empty or more full just so, O Bhikkhus, though many Bhikkhus pass entirely away in that kind of passing away which leaves not a trace behind, yet does not [the Saṅgha] thereby seem to be either more empty or more full. This is the fifth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean has only one taste, the taste of salt just so, O Bhikkhus, has this doctrine and discipline only one flavour, the flavour of emancipation. This is the sixth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean is full of gems, of gems of various kinds--that is to say, the pearl, the diamond, the catseye, the chank, rock, coral, silver, gold, the ruby, and the cornelian--just so, O Bhikkhus, is this doctrine and discipline full of gems, of gems of various kinds, among which are <a id="pg305"><span class="f2 g"><b>[305]</b></span></a> these gems,--that is to say, the four Earnest Meditations, the fourfold Great Struggle, the four Roads to Iddhi, the five Moral Powers, the five Moral Senses, the seven kinds of Wisdom, and the noble eightfold Path. This is the seventh [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'Just, O Bhikkhus, as the great ocean is the dwelling-place of mighty beings, among which are the Timi, the Timiṅgala, the Timitimiṅgala, the Asuras, the Nāgas. and the Gandhabbas; just as there are in the great ocean creatures so constituted that they stretch from one to five hundred leagues--just so, O Bhikkhus, is this doctrine and discipline the resort of mighty beings, among whom are he who has entered the First Path (the converted man, the Sotāpanno) and he who has realized the fruit thereof, he who has entered the Second Path (the Sakadāgāmin) and he who has realized the fruit thereof, he who has entered the Third Path (the Anāgāmin) and he who has realized the fruit thereof, the Arahat, and he who has realized the fruit of Arahatship. This is the eighth [of such qualities].</p>

					<p class="f4">'These, O Bhikkhus, are the eight marvellous and wonderful qualities in this doctrine and discipline by the constant perception of which the Bhikkhus take delight therein.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, on perceiving that matter, gave forth at that time this ecstatic utterance:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The rain falls heavily on that which is covered, not upon that which is revealed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Reveal, therefore, what thou hast concealed, and the rain shall touch thee not<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> Now the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Now henceforth I, O Bhikkhus, will not hold Uposatha, nor recite the Pātimokkha; let you yourselves, O Bhikkhus, henceforth hold Uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha. It is, O Bhikkhus, an impossible thing and an inexpedient that the Tathāgata should hold Uposatha and recite the Pātimokkha before an assembly which is not pure. And the Pātimokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be listened to by one who has committed an offence. Whosoever shall so listen to it, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, for whomsoever shall listen to the Pātimokkha at a time when he is guilty, to interdict for him the Pātimokkha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be interdicted. On the day of Uposatha, on the fourteenth or fifteenth day of the month, and at a time when that individual is present, thus shall it be proposed in the midst of the Saṅgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Let the venerable Saṅgha hear me. Such and such an individual is guilty of an offence. For him <a id="pg307"><span class="f2 g"><b>[307]</b></span></a> do I interdict the Pātimokkha to the effect that it shall not be recited when he is present. The Pātimokkha is accordingly interdicted."'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3.1">3.1</a> Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus thinking, 'No one knows that we are guilty' listened to the Pātimokkha. The Thera Bhikkhus, who understood the thoughts of other men, told the Bhikkhus, saying, 'Such and such a one, Sirs, and such and such a one, <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, thinking, "No one knows that we are guilty," are listening to the Pātimokkha.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus heard that, they, thinking 'the good Bhikkhus will (otherwise) first interdict the Pātimokkha to us,' interdicted the Pātimokkha to the Bhikkhus who were pure and innocent before (they had time to do so to them), and this without ground and without cause.</p>

					<p class="f4">Those Bhikkhus who were moderate murmured, &amp;c (as usual, down to) told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus have [acted thus]?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse, he said: 'The Pātimokkha is not, O Bhikkhus, to be interdicted to pure and innocent Bhikkhus without ground and without cause. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3.2">3.2</a> 'There is one kind of inhibition of the Pātimokkha, O Bhikkhus, which is illegal, and one <a id="pg308"><span class="f2 g"><b>[308]</b></span></a> which is legal. There are two . . . ., three . . . ., four (&amp;c., up to) ten kinds of inhibition of the Pātimokkha which are illegal, and one, two (&amp;c., up to) ten which are legal.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When a Bhikkhu, Lord, intends to take upon himself the conduct (of any matter that has to be <a id="pg314"><span class="f2 g"><b>[314]</b></span></a> decided)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>, under what conditions should he take the conduct thereof upon himself<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'A Bhikkhu, Upāli, who intends to take upon himself the conduct of any matter, should take such conduct upon himself under five conditions.</p>

					<p class="f4">'(In the first place.) A Bhikkhu, Upāli, who intends to take the conduct of any matter upon himself, should thus consider: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself; is it now the right time for the taking charge of the conduct thereof, or is it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it is not the right time, he should not, Upāli, take charge of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'(Secondly.) If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it is the right time, he should, Upāli, further consider thus: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself, is it just, or is it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would not be just, he should not take charge of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'(Thirdly.) If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would be just, he should, Upāli, further consider thus: "The conduct of this matter which I intend to take upon myself; would it tend to advantage, or would it not?" If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would not tend to advantage, he should not, Upāli, take charge of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'(Fourthly.) If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that it would tend to <a id="pg315"><span class="f2 g"><b>[315]</b></span></a> profit, he should, Upāli, further consider thus: "While I am taking the conduct of this matter upon myself, shall I find that the Bhikkhus who are my intimates and associates are on my side in accordance with the Dhamma and the Vinaya, or shall I not?" If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that he will not, he should not, Upāli, take charge of it.</p>

					<p class="f4">(Fifthly.) If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that he will find them so, he should further, Upāli, consider thus: "Whilst I am taking the conduct of this matter upon myself, will the Saṅgha, as a result thereof, fall into strife, quarrel, contention, or dispute, or will there arise a split in the Saṅgha, disunion in the Saṅgha, diversity of position in the Saṅgha, diversity of action in the Saṅgha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>?" If that Bhikkhu, Upāli, so considering, come to the conclusion that that will happen, he should not take charge of it. But if that Bhikkhu, Upāli, thus considering, should come to the conclusion that that will not happen, he should take charge of it. The taking charge of a matter, Upāli, subject to these five conditions, will not give cause to subsequent remorse.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In five ways, Upāli, is repentance to be brought home to a Bhikkhu who has wrong-fully warned another Bhikkhu, (that is to say, by saying to him): "At the wrong time did you warn him, Sir, not at the right time: wherein is need of repentance. Untruthfully did you warn him, Sir, and not according to fact: wherein is need of repentance. In harshness did you warn him, Sir, and not gently: wherein is need of repentance.
