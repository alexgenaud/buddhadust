					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time, a century<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> after the death of the Blessed One, the Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;, Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ians, promulgated at Vesāl&icirc; the ten theses:--(1) that storing salt in a horn vessel was permissible; (2) that the midday meal might be eaten when the sun's shadow showed two finger breadths after noon; (3) that he who intends to go into the village could begin to eat again after he had once left off; (4) that a number of Bhikkhus residing within the same boundary might hold Uposatha separately; (5) that a Saŋgha not at unity within itself might carry out an official act, undertaking to inform Bhikkhus of it; (6) that it was permissible for a Bhikkhu to do anything adopted as a practice by his Upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āya; (7) that curds might be eaten by one who had already finished his midday meal; (8) that it was permissible to drink unfermented toddy; (9) that a rug or mat need not be of the limited size prescribed if it had no fringe; (10) that it was permissible to receive gold and silver<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg387"><span class="f2 g"><b>[387]</b></span></a> Now at that time the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, who was wandering through the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian country, arrived at Vesāl&icirc;; and there the venerable Yasa stayed at the Mahāvana, in the K&ucirc;<i>t</i>āgāra Hall.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;, on Uposatha day, filled a copper pot with water and placed it in the midst of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and said to such of their Vesālian lay disciples as came there: 'Give, Sirs, to the Saŋgha a kahāpa<i>n</i>a<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, or half a one, or a pāda, or a māsaka. It will be wanted for the Saŋgha, for the provision of various utensils.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had thus spoken, the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, said to the lay disciples: 'Do, Sirs, nothing of the kind. The use of gold and silver is not allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as neither allow it to be given to them, nor take charge of it. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as are men whose gems and jewelry have been laid aside, and who are without silver and without gold.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Though the lay disciples from Vesāl&icirc; had been thus addressed by the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, they gave money to the Saŋgha. And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;, at the close of the night, reserving one portion<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>, divided that money according to the number of the Bhikkhus. And they said to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, friend Yasa, is thy due portion of the money.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg388"><span class="f2 g"><b>[388]</b></span></a> 'I have no due portion in that money. I do not allow any money to be given to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Then the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; said one to another: 'This brother, Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, upbraids and reviles, and renders dissatisfied believing and faithful followers. Come, let us carry out against him the Act of Reconciliation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.' And they did so.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, said to them: 'It has been laid down, Sirs, by the Blessed One, that a companion shall be appointed to go as messenger with a Bhikkhu against whom the Act of Reconciliation has been carried out<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>. Appoint, Sirs, a Bhikkhu, as companion messenger to me.' And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; deputed a Bhikkhu to that work, and gave him as a companion messenger to the venerable Yasa.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Yasa, taking the companion Bhikkhu with him, entered into Vesāl&icirc;, and said to the believing laymen there:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I am said, Sirs, to be upbraiding and reviling, and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, thereby that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma, and what is against the Vinaya to be against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya to be Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> 'Now the Blessed One was once, Sirs, staying at Sāvatthi in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's pleasure-ground. And there, Sirs, the Blessed One exhorted the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg389"><span class="f2 g"><b>[389]</b></span></a> '"There are, O Bhikkhus, four obstructions of the sun and moon, by which when the sun and moon are affected, they give no heat and they give no light, and they are no longer glorious. And what are the four? They are clouds and fog and dusty smoke and Rāhu<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>, by which when the sun and the moon are affected they give neither heat nor light nor sheen. Just so, O Bhikkhus, there are four stains by which when Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans are affected they give neither heat nor light nor sheen. And what are the four? There are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans who drink strong drink, and things intoxicating, abstaining not therefrom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>. This is the first of such stains. And further, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans who practise sexual intercourse, and abstain not therefrom. This is the second of such stains. And further, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans who accept silver and gold, abstaining not from the use thereof. This is the third of such stains. And lastly, O Bhikkhus, there are some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans who gain their livelihood by low arts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>, abstaining not from such means of life. This is the fourth of such stains."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus spoke, Sirs, the Blessed One: and when the Happy One had thus spoken, the Master further said:</p>

					      <p class="f4 in2">'"Stained by lust and malice, some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans,<br />
							<a id="pg390"><span class="f2 g"><b>[390]</b></span></a> Men blinded by ignorance, praise things that seem to have delight.<br />
							Strong drink they drink and fierce, indulge in sensual acts,<br />
							Devoid of wisdom, silver and gold they take.<br />
							And by low arts some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans live.<br />
							Stains are such actions called by the Buddha of the Solar race,<br />
							Stains--by which defiled some Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhmans,<br />
							Impure brutes and unclean, give neither heat nor light.<br />
							Covered rather by darkness, purblind, enslaved by craving lusts,<br />
							They enlarge the realm of death<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>, and dread rebirth they gain."</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is for upholding this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; what is against the Vinaya to be against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya to be Vinaya.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> 'And once the Blessed One was staying, Sirs, at Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, at the Kalandaka Nivāpa. Now at that time among the royal attendants sitting together in the women's apartment in the palace, the following saying was heard: "Silver and gold is allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg391"><span class="f2 g"><b>[391]</b></span></a> The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as accept it, and take it in charge." Now at that time Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, a village headman, was present. And he said to the people there: "Say not so, Sirs. Neither is silver and gold allowed to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, nor do they accept it, nor take it in charge. The Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as are men who have laid aside gems and jewelry, and are without silver, and without gold." And the headman, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, succeeded in satisfying them.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then the headman, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, went to the place where the Blessed One was and saluted him, and took his seat on one side. And he told the Blessed One the whole matter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Now am I, Lord, in maintaining as I did, one who speaks according to the word of the Blessed One, one who does not falsely represent the Blessed One, one who does not put forth minor matters in the place of the true Dhamma? And is there anything that leads to blame in such discussion, this way and that, as touching the observance of the rules of the order<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Most certainly, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, in maintaining thus you speak in accordance with my word, and do not represent me falsely, nor put forth minor matters as the true Dhamma. Nor is there any thing leading to blame in such discussions. For gold and silver is not allowed, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, to the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, nor ought they to accept it, nor take it in charge. Men who have laid aside gems and jewelry are the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, <a id="pg392"><span class="f2 g"><b>[392]</b></span></a> men without silver and without gold. For to whomsoever, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, gold and silver are allowed, to him also the five kinds of sensual pleasure<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> are allowed. And to whomsoever these five kinds of pleasure are allowed, him you may know of a certainty to be following neither the rule of the Sama<i>n</i>as, nor the rule of the sons of Sākya. Although, Ma<i>n</i>i<i>k</i>&ucirc;<i>l</i>aka, I have said that he who is in need of grass may seek for grass, and he who is in need of wood may seek for wood, and he who is in need of a conveyance may seek for a conveyance, and he who is in need of a servant may seek for a servant; yet have I never said in any way whatever that gold or silver may be sought after or accepted."</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is for maintaining this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; that what is against the Vinaya is against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya is Vinaya.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> 'And once, Sirs, the Blessed One at the same place, at Rā<i>g</i>agaha, on the occasion of the matter of Upananda, the Sākyan, distinctly laid down a precept by which gold and silver were forbidden<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is for maintaining this opinion that I, Sirs, have been said to be upbraiding and reviling and rendering dissatisfied believing and faithful followers, in that I have said what is against the <a id="pg393"><span class="f2 g"><b>[393]</b></span></a> Dhamma to be against the Dhamma, and what is Dhamma to be Dhamma; that what is against the Vinaya is against the Vinaya, and what is Vinaya is Vinaya.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.6">1.6</a> When he had thus spoken, the lay brethren said to Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka There is but one, Sirs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>, who is a Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>a, our master, Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka. All the rest are no Sama<i>n</i>as, neither Sakyaputtiyas. Let the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, dwell among us. We will exert ourselves to provide him with robes, and food, and medicine, and the necessaries for the sick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, having gained over the lay brethren, returned with the companion Bhikkhu to the &Acirc;rāma,</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.7">1.7</a> And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; asked the companion Bhikkhu: 'Did Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, obtain, Sir, the forgiveness of the lay brethren?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Evil, Sirs, hath been wrought against us. Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, and he alone has been decided to be a Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>a, and all of us neither Sama<i>n</i>as nor Sakyaputtiyas.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; said: 'The venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, without being deputed by us, has proclaimed to laymen (a false doctrine)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span>. Come, let us carry out the Act of Suspension<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span> against him.' And <a id="pg394"><span class="f2 g"><b>[394]</b></span></a> they assembled together with the intention of doing so.</p>

					<p class="f4">But the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, rose up into the sky and descended at Kosamb&icirc;. And he sent messengers to the Bhikkhus of the Western country, and of Avanti, and of the Southern country<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>, saying, 'Let your reverences come! We must take in charge this legal question before what is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and what is Dhamma is put aside; before what is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and what is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.8">1.8</a> Now at that time the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> was dwelling on the Ahoga&#7749;ga Hill<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>. And thither the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, went; and on his arrival he saluted the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;, and took his seat on one side: and being so seated he said to him:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, these Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; have <a id="pg395"><span class="f2 g"><b>[395]</b></span></a> put forward ten theses.' And he told him what they were<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span>, and added: 'Come now, Lord, let us take in charge this last question before what is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and what is Dhamma is put aside; before what is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and what is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;, in assent to the venerable Yasa Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-putta.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then about sixty Bhikkhus from the Western country, all of whom were hermits, all of whom lived only on alms, all of whom dressed only in cast-off clothes, and kept only three robes, and all of whom were Arahats, assembled together at the Ahoga&#7749;ga Hill. And about eighty-eight from Avanti and the Southern country, some of whom were hermits, and some of whom, lived only on alms, and some of whom dressed only in cast-off clothes, and some of whom kept only three robes, but all of whom were Arahats, met together with them on the Ahoga&#7749;ga Hill.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.9">1.9</a> And the Thera Bhikkhus, consulting together, came to this conclusion: 'This legal question, now, is hard and subtle. How can we obtain such support that we may have the greater power at the decision thereof<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg396"><span class="f2 g"><b>[396]</b></span></a> Now at that time the venerable Revata was dwelling at Soreyya, and he was wise in the traditions, one who had learned the Agamas (the four Nikāyas), and knew by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mātikās; intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, devoted to the precepts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>. And the Thera Bhikkhus thought that if they could gain him over to their side, they would attain their end.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Revata, by the divine ear, clear and surpassing that of men, heard the Thera Bhikkhus as they were thus consulting together; and he thought: 'This legal question is both hard and subtle, it would not become me to hold back therefrom. But even now those Bhikkhus (the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ians) will be coming. It would be unpleasant travelling for me were I to fall in with them. Let me go on before them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Revata went from Soreyya to Sa<i>m</i>kassa. And when the Thera Bhikkhus went to Soreyya, and asked: 'Where is the venerable Revata?' they said: 'He is gone to Sa<i>m</i>kassa.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the venerable Revata had gone on from Sa<i>m</i>kassa to Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>aku<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. And when the Thera Bhikkhus came to Sa<i>m</i>kassa, and asked: 'Where is the venerable Revata?' they said: 'He is gone on to Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>aku<i>g</i><i>g</i>a.' And in the same way they followed him thither, and to Udumbara, and to Aggalapura, and to Saha<i>g</i>āti, and there they met with the venerable Revata.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.10">1.10</a> And the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc; said to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg397"><span class="f2 g"><b>[397]</b></span></a> 'Friend, the brother Revata is wise in the traditions, has learnt the Agamas, knows by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, and the Mātikās, he is intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, and devoted to the precepts. If we ask the venerable Revata a puzzling question, he is capable of spending the whole night on that one question. And even now the venerable Revata will call upon a Bhikkhu who is an intoner<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span>, and a pupil of his. Do you, therefore, when the Bhikkhu has concluded, go to the venerable Revata and ask him concerning these ten theses (points).'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Sir,' said the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, in assent to the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Revata called upon the Bhikkhu, the pupil of his, the intoner. And when the Bhikkhu had concluded, the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, went to the venerable Revata, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And, so seated, he said to the venerable Revata<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the horn-salt-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this horn-salt-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, to carry about salt in a horn with the intention of putting it into food which has not been salted?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the two-inch-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this two-inch-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, to eat the midday meal <a id="pg398"><span class="f2 g"><b>[398]</b></span></a> beyond the right time, provided only that the shadow has not yet turned two inches?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the village-trip-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this village-trip-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, for one who has once finished his meal, and refused any more, to eat food which has not been left over, on the ground that he is about to proceed into the village?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the circuit-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this circuit-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, for a number of Bhikkhus who dwell within the same circuit, within the same boundary, to hold separate Uposathas?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the indemnity-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this indemnity-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, for a Saŋgha, which is not legally constituted<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span>, to perform an official act on the ground that they will afterwards obtain the sanction of such Bhikkhus who may subsequently arrive?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is the precedent-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this precedent-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, to do a thing on the ground that, "My preceptor (upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āya) has practised this; or my teacher (ā<i>k</i>ariya) has practised that?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'In some cases, Sir, this is allowable, and in some not<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg399"><span class="f2 g"><b>[399]</b></span></a> 'Is the churn-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this churn-license?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, for one who has once finished his meal, and has refused any more, to drink milk not left over from the meal, on the ground that it has left the condition of milk, and has not yet reached the condition of curds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, to drink toddy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What, Sir, is this toddy?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it allowable, Lord, to drink spirits which have left the condition of not being spirits, and yet have not acquired intoxicating properties<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is a rug or mat (when it is beyond the prescribed size) lawful, Lord, because it is unfringed?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is gold and silver, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, Sir, it is not allowable.'</p>

					<p class="f4">These are the ten theses, Lord, which these Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; have put forth. Come, Lord, let us take this legal question in hand before that which is not Dhamma is spread abroad, and that which is Dhamma is put aside; before that which is not Vinaya is spread abroad, and that which is Vinaya is put aside; before those who argue against the Dhamma become powerful, and those <a id="pg400"><span class="f2 g"><b>[400]</b></span></a> who argue in favour of the Dhamma become weak; before those who argue against the Vinaya become powerful, and those who argue in favour of the Vinaya become weak.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Sir,' said the venerable Revata, in assent to the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the First Portion for Recitation.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> Now the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; heard the rumour: 'Yasa, they say, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, wishing to take this legal question in hand, is seeking about for support, and support they say he is succeeding in getting.' And they thought: 'This legal question, now, is hard and subtle. How can we obtain such support that we may have the greater power at the decision thereof<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they thought: 'The venerable Yasa, who dwells at Soreyya, is wise in the traditions, and is one who has learnt the Agamas, who knows by heart the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the Mātikās, is intelligent, discreet, and wise, modest, conscientious, and devoted to the precepts. If we could gain him over to our side, we should attain our end.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; got together much property, requisites, a number of things of the Sama<i>n</i>as' life--to wit, bowls and robes, and rugs, and needlecases, and girdles, and filters, and regulation-pots<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span>. And, taking this property with <a id="pg401"><span class="f2 g"><b>[401]</b></span></a> them, they went up stream by boat to Saha<i>g</i>āti, and there disembarked, and took their meal at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.2">2.2</a> Now to the venerable Sā<i>lh</i>a, who retired apart and was plunged in meditation, there occurred this doubtful problem: 'Are the Bhikkhus of the East, or the Bhikkhus of the West, the more in accordance with the Dhamma in the opinion that they hold?' And having gone over the Dhamma and the Vinaya in his mind, he came to the conclusion, 'The Bhikkhus of the East are not, and the Bhikkhus of the West are, in accordance with the Dhamma in the opinion that they hold.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain one of the deities in the Pure Abode<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span> perceived how this doubtful problem had arisen in the venerable Sā<i>lh</i>a's mind, and as quickly as a strong man could stretch forth his bent arm, or draw it in again when it was outstretched, so quickly did that deity vanish from the Pure Abode, and appeared before the venerable Sā<i>lh</i>a; saying to him: 'Thou art quite right, Sā<i>lh</i>a; it is the Eastern Bhikkhus whose opinions are against the Dhamma, and the Western Bhikkhus whose opinions accord therewith. Do thou, therefore, O Sā<i>lh</i>a, even as the Dhamma is, so take thy stand!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Both formerly, O deity, and now, also, do I take my stand even as the Dhamma is. Notwithstanding, I shall not make manifest my opinion until (the Saŋgha) shall have appointed me (judge) over this question<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.3">2.3</a> Now the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;, taking with them the aforesaid property, went to the place <a id="pg402"><span class="f2 g"><b>[402]</b></span></a> where the venerable Revata was, and said to him: 'Let the venerable Thera receive at our hands these requisites of a Sama<i>n</i>a's life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But he refused to receive it, saying, 'Not so, my friends. I have all the things<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span> I want.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a Bhikkhu named Uttara, who had been twenty years admitted into the Order<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span>, was the attendant upon the venerable Revata. And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; went to him, and said: 'Let your reverence receive at our hands these requisites of a Sama<i>n</i>a's life.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But he made the same reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then they said: 'People used to offer such requisites to the Blessed One. If he received them, they were happy. If he did not receive them, they used to offer them to the venerable &Acirc;nanda, saying, "Let the venerable Thera receive these requisites of a Sama<i>n</i>a's life: that will be just as if the Blessed One had received them." Let the venerable Uttara receive these things: that will be as if the Thera had received them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Uttara, being thus importuned by the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;, accepted one robe, saying, 'You may tell me, friends, what you want.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Uttara say thus much for us to the Thera: "Let the venerable Thera say thus much in the meeting of the Saŋgha--'It is in the regions of the East that the Buddhas, the Blessed Ones, are born. It is the Bhikkhus of the East who hold opinions in accord with the Dhamma, whereas the Bhikkhus of the West do not.'"'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg403"><span class="f2 g"><b>[403]</b></span></a> 'Even so, Sirs,' said the venerable Uttara, in assent to the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc;. And he went to Revata, and told him what they had said.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thou urgest me, O Bhikkhu, to that which is against the Dhamma,' said the Thera, and sent away the venerable Uttara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; said to the venerable Uttara: 'What, fiend Uttara, did the Thera say?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is an evil you have wrought me, Sirs. The Thera has sent me away, saying, "Thou urgest me, O Bhikkhu, to what is against the Dhamma."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Are you not, Sir, of full age, of twenty years (since your upasampadā)?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Yes, Sirs, I am.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then do we take the nissaya under you as your pupils<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.4">2.4</a> Now the Saŋgha met together with the intention of deciding the legal question. And the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Saŋgha, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. If we were to settle this question, it might be that those Bhikkhus who had at first taken the matter in hand might raise it again<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span>. If it seem meet to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha settle it at that place where it arose.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg404"><span class="f2 g"><b>[404]</b></span></a> Then the Thera Bhikkhus went to Vesāl&icirc;, with the intention of settling the matter there.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the eldest Thera in the world, Sabbakām&icirc; by name, one who was of a hundred and twenty years' standing from the date of his upasampadā, and who had been a pupil<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span> of the venerable &Acirc;nanda, was living at Vesāl&icirc;. And the venerable Revata said to the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall go to that Vihāra in which the Thera Sabbakām&icirc; dwells. Do you go betimes to the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;, and question him as touching these ten points.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;, in assent to the venerable Revata.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Revata came to that Vihāra in which the venerable Sabbakām&icirc; lived; and a sleeping-place was made ready for the former in the inner chamber, and for the latter in front thereof. And the venerable Revata, thinking, 'This Thera, though so old, does not care to sleep,' did not go to rest. And the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;, thinking, 'This Bhikkhu, though a traveller and tired, does not care to sleep,' did not go to rest.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.5">2.5</a> Then when the night was far spent, the venerable Sabbakām&icirc; said to the venerable Revata:</p>

					<p class="f4">'By what manner of life, beloved one, have you lived now these so many years?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'By continuing in the sense of love, honoured friend, have I continued thus so many years.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say that you have continued thus, beloved one, by easiness of life: and that indeed, beloved one, is an easy life, (I mean) the continuing in love.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg405"><span class="f2 g"><b>[405]</b></span></a> 'Even long ago, Sir, when I was a layman, was much love laid up in my heart, therefore is it that now also I live much in the sense of love, and indeed since long I have attained to Arahatship. And by what manner of life have you lived now these many years?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'By continuing in the sense of the emptiness (of worldly things) have I, beloved one, lived these many years.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'They say that you, honoured friend, have continued thus by the sense of being a man born to greatness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span>; and that indeed, honoured friend, is the same feeling, (I mean) the sense of the emptiness of things.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even long ago, beloved one, when I was a layman, had I a strong sense of the emptiness of things, therefore is it that now also I live much in that feeling, and indeed since long I have attained to Arahatship.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.6">2.6</a> Now<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> this conversation between the Thera Bhikkhus was still unfinished when the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc; arrived there. And he went up to the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And, so seated, he said to the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;:</p>

					<p class="f4">'These Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>ian Bhikkhus of Vesāl&icirc; have put forth in Vesāl&icirc; these ten points;' and he told them all<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span>. 'Now you, O Thera, have mastered much Dhamma and Vinaya at the feet of your preceptor.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg406"><span class="f2 g"><b>[406]</b></span></a> What, then, is the conclusion to which you, O Thera, come as you lay over in your mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya;--whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma, that of the Bhikkhus of the East, or that of the Bhikkhus of the West?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You also, Sir, have mastered much Dhamma and Vinaya at the feet of your preceptor. What, then, is the conclusion to which you, Sir, come as you lay over in your mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya;--whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma, that of the Bhikkhus of the East, or that of the Bhikkhus of the West?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The conclusion to which I come, Lord, as I so lay over in my mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya, is this--that the Bhikkhus of the East hold an opinion that is not in accord with the Dhamma, while the Bhikkhus of the West are in accord with the Dhamma. Notwithstanding, I do not intend to make manifest my opinion until (the Saŋgha) shall have appointed me (referee) over this question<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The conclusion to which I also have come, Sir, as I lay over in my mind the Dhamma and the Vinaya, is this--that the Bhikkhus of the East hold an opinion that is not in accordance with the Dhamma, while the Bhikkhus of the West are in accord with the Dhamma. Notwithstanding, I do not intend to make manifest my opinion until (the Saŋgha) shall have appointed me (referee) over this question.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.7">2.7</a> Then the Saŋgha met together with the intention of enquiring into this legal question. But while they were enquiring into it, both was much pointless speaking brought forth and also the sense <a id="pg407"><span class="f2 g"><b>[407]</b></span></a> in no single speech was clear<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span>. Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Saŋgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. Whilst we are discussing this legal question, there is both much pointless speaking, and no sense is clear in any single speech. If it seem meet to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha settle this legal question by referring it (to a jury)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And he chose four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West--from the Bhikkhus of the East the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;, and the venerable Sā<i>lh</i>a, and the venerable Khu<i>g</i><i>g</i>a-sobhita, and the venerable Vāsabha-gāmika--and from the Bhikkhus of the West, the venerable Revata, and the venerable Sambh&ucirc;ta Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc;, and the venerable Yasa, the son of Kāka<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka, and the venerable Sumana. Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Saŋgha:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. During the enquiry into this matter there has been much pointless talk among us, and in no single utterance is the sense clear. If it seem meet to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha delegate four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West to settle this question by reference. This is the resolution.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. During the enquiry into this matter there has been much pointless talk among us, and the sense in any single utterance is not clear. The Saŋgha delegates four Bhikkhus of the East and four Bhikkhus of the West to settle this question by reference. Whosoever <a id="pg408"><span class="f2 g"><b>[408]</b></span></a> of the venerable ones approves thereof, let him keep silence. Whosoever approves not thereof, let him speak. The delegation is made accordingly. The Saŋgha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a Bhikkhu named A<i>g</i>ita, of ten years' standing, was the reciter of the Pātimokkha to the Saŋgha. Him did the Saŋgha appoint as seat regulator<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> to the Thera Bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Thera Bhikkhus thought, 'At what place, now, ought we to settle this legal question?' And it occurred to them: 'This Vālika &Acirc;rāma is a pleasant place, quiet and undisturbed. Let us settle the matter there.' And thither the Thera Bhikkhus proceeded to enquire into the question.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.8">2.8</a> Then the venerable Revata laid a resolution before the Saŋgha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span>: 'Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me.

And the venerable Sabbakām&icirc; laid a resolution before the Saŋgha: 'If it seem meet to the Saŋgha, I, when asked by Revata touching the Vinaya, will give reply.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Revata said to the venerable Sabbakām&icirc;: 'Is the horn-salt-license, Lord, allowable?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg414"><span class="f2 g"><b>[414]</b></span></a> '<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span>This legal question, Sir, has been concluded; and being settled, it is settled once for all. Nevertheless, Sir, do you question me on these ten points in the midst also of the Saŋgha <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span>, in order to persuade those Bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn61" href="#n61">61</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">So the venerable Revata questioned the venerable Sabbakām&icirc; on the ten points also in the midst of the Saŋgha, and as he was questioned on one after the other, the venerable Sabbakām&icirc; gave reply.</p>

					<p class="f4">9. Now whereas at this rehearsal of the Vinaya seven hundred Bhikkhus, without one more, without one being wanting, took part, therefore is that rehearsal of the Vinaya called 'That of the seven hundred<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> As pointed out at xxii of our Introduction, we believe this number ought not to be taken too literally, but to be considered a round number.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The above terms are explained below, §§ 1, 10, and 2, 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> About a penny; on this and the following terms, see Rh. D.'s 'Ancient Coins and Measures, &amp;c.,' p. S.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>iviso. See Mahāvagga VIII, 27, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya-kamma. See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> On Anud&ucirc;ta, see <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 20-22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> That is, eclipse.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> It is curious that this matter is not, like all the following, referred to in the S&icirc;las. See Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 190.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Those, namely, which are set out in the Mahā S&icirc;la (Rh. D.'s Buddhist Suttas,' pp. 196-203).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> That is, by being repeatedly reborn they continually die. Va<i>d</i><i>dh</i>enti ka<i>t</i>asin ti punappuna<i>m</i> kalevara-nikkhipamāna-bh&ucirc;mi<i>m</i> va<i>d</i><i>dh</i>enti, says Buddhaghosa. The word occurs at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 146.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The whole is repeated in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The whole of this speech recurs, nearly word for word, in the Mahāvagga VI, 31, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This is set out in full in the Sutta Vibha&#7749;ga in the Introduction to the 18th Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiya,</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> They are speaking to Yasa and the anud&ucirc;ta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> This cannot refer to the 9th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, which only speaks of making known grievous offences. A&#7749;guttara II, 5, 2 refers to laymen as well as to sāma<i>n</i>eras.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Ukkhepaniya-kamma. See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 25.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> On these terms, compare note on Mahāvagga VII, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Sā<i>n</i>avās&icirc; is, literally, he who wears a hempen dress. In the traditions of the Sanskrit Buddhist literature we find mentioned a Sā<i>n</i>avāsika, said to be a predecessor, in the teacher and pupil line, of Upagupta (Wassilief, p. 44). The Nepalese call him So<i>n</i>avās&icirc; (Rajendralāl Mitra, 'Sanskrit Buddhist Literature of Nepāl,' p. 10). He is the hero of the Sā<i>n</i>avāsi Avadāna part of the Bodhisatva Avadāna Kalpalatā (Mitra, p. 67, Bendall 'Catalogue of Cambridge MSS.,' p. 42), where the name is explained: 'I wished for an ochre-coloured robe (so<i>n</i>a); hence I was called Sā<i>n</i>avāsi.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> See, for the position of this mountain, our note last quoted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> In the text the full words of I, 1 are here repeated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Compare below, XII, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> These adjectives have occurred above at Mahāvagga X, I, 2, and <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 11, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Sarabhā<i>n</i>aka<i>m</i>. See our note above at <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 3, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The whole of the following questions and answers recur below at XII, 2, 8, where the reasons of the answers also appear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Vaggena. See our note on the 21st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 2, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> That is, of course, according as the thing enjoined is, or is not, <span class="f2 g"><b>[399]</b></span> lawful. Eka<i>k</i><i>k</i>o kappat&icirc; ti ida<i>m</i> dhammikam āki<i>n</i><i>n</i>a<i>m</i> sandhāya vutta<i>m</i>, says Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> That is, which is neither liquid nor solid: something apparently like buttermilk.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> It is a question constantly arising under the excise laws in India and Ceylon, whether the liquor in the case has become arrack, or is only arrack in the making, and unfermented. This last is called unfermented toddy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Compare above, XII, 1, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> On Dhamma-karaka, see our note at <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 13, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> The Heaven, so called.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Compare below, § 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Literally, 'I have the three robes.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> V&icirc;sativasso; that is, since his upasampadā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Pa<i>n</i>āmesi. That is, permanently from attendance upon him. Compare Mahāvagga I, 27. 2, where the word is used of the formal dismissal or turning away of a pupil.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> Garu-nissaya<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hāma; on which Buddhaghosa has nothing, though the phrase does not occur elsewhere in the Khandhakas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> Compare the 63rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> Literally, 'had dwelt in the same Vihāra with.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Mahāpurisa. On the subsequent history of which word, see Senart's 'L&eacute;gende du Buddha,' pp. 54, 127,</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>arahi. Compare 'Book of the Great Decease,' III, 53; Childers, p. 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> The text repeats XII, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> Compare above, § 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> So above in <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 24, 19, where the proceeding adopted in the subsequent sentences is laid down for use on such an occasion.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> Ubbāhikāya. See the passage quoted in the last note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> &Acirc;sana-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>āpaka<i>m</i>. This office is not mentioned in the other Khandhakas. We should expect to find it at <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 21, 2. The reason of this is that it is no office of authority. The different referees would take their seats in the order of their seniority, and all that the āsana-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>āpaka would have to do would be to see that they were provided with everything they required (it was not much, chiefly mats or rugs to sit upon) in the hall or grove where they met.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Here, of course, consisting of the eight referees.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXXVIII.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXXVII.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXXV.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> Sa<i>m</i>yutta must here be used for Khandhaka. The passage referred to is Mahāvagga II (the Uposatha Khandhaka), 8, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Vinaya-vatthu. Here used as a title, apparently of the Khandhakas. The passage referred to is in the Kampeyyaka Khandhaka (Mahāvagga IX, 3, 5).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> See the note above on XII, I. 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXXV.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya LI.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> That is, does the fact of its being unfringed make legal a mat or rug otherwise illegal by reason of its size? See above, XII, 1, 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Pā<i>k</i>ittiya LXXXIX.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The 18th Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> It is clear from the word tva<i>m</i> āvuso, that Sabbakām&icirc; is here addressing Revata.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> That is not only of the referees, but of all the Bhikkhus there at Vesāl&icirc;.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> Bhikkh&ucirc;na<i>m</i> sa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>attiyā. See the use of this phrase at <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 14, 26, and VII, 4. I. and our note on the latter of those two passages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Compare XI, 1, 15.</p>
