					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the Third Khandhaka, on the Accumulation of Offences.</p>

					<p class="f4">&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Samodhāna-parivāsa. It is clear from the next chapter that this probation did not affect the Mānatta to which he was liable for that first offence. The Mānatta always lasted six days, and was preceded by a probation equal in length to the time during which the offence had been concealed. If now, during that probation, another offence was committed and concealed, the penalties for this new offence and for the old one were not accumulative but concurrent. The offender lost the advantage of the probation he had already undergone, he was thrown back to the commencement of his term of probation, and had to begin again. But the new term of probation--equal in length to whichever was the longest of the two periods during which he had concealed the two offences--satisfied both the concealments, and the Mānatta which still, as it would have done before, followed at the end of the probation, satisfied both the offences. See our note below on chapter 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> As in chapter 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> From this and what follows it is clear that however many are the offences, and however various the periods of concealment, the probation is only to last for the same period as the longest of the concealments has lasted. Thus the Samanta Pāsādikā says here: agghasamodhāno nāma sambahulāsu āpatt&icirc;su yā ekā vā dve vā tisso vā sambahulā vā āpattiyo sabba<i>k</i>irapa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annāyo tāsa<i>m</i> agghena samodhāya tāsa<i>m</i> rattipari<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edavasena avasesāna<i>m</i> &ucirc;natarapa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annāna<i>m</i> āpatt&icirc;na<i>m</i> parivāso diyyati.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Literally, 'according to the value of whichever offences among those offences have been the longest concealed.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Tadupādāya; see chapters 23. 1 and 2, 24. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This is merely repeated to lay a basis for the following variations. See below, chapter 25.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> In chapter 34, § 1, di<i>t</i><i>th</i>&icirc;, instead of nibbematiko, is put in opposition to vematiko.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> See our note above, on Mahāvagga II, 21, 2, and compare VII, 1, 7; VIII, 32, 1; X, 1, 2; <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 11, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This expression recurs below, chaps. 25, 27, &amp;c. Compare the use of r&ucirc;hati at Mahāvagga VI, 14, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> See above, chap. 22. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> This repetition of the last chapter is again only to afford a basis for the succeeding variations, as above, in chap. 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> That these are plurals, and not singulars, is clear from § 3, below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Suddhanta-parivāso. The Samanta Pāsādika says, Ta<i>m</i> gahetvā gahita-divasato yāva upasampadā-divaso tāva rattiyo ga<i>n</i>etvā parivasitabba<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> This and the following sentences are given in the text in full, as in the last paragraph.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> That is to say, shortly; if the guilty Bhikkhu can determine the time during which the offence has been concealed (on which the length of the probation depends), then he is to undergo the corresponding probation. If not, he is to undergo the so-called 'probation of complete purification,' which, as it is computed from the date of his ordination, is quite certain to be as long as the time of the longest concealment of any offence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> The text has a separate paragraph for each of these cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> That is, on any of the above eight events occurring in any of the above five cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Parimā<i>n</i>ā, the meaning of which is open to much doubt. The Samanta Pāsādikā merely says, Antarā sambahulā āpattiyo āpa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati parimā<i>n</i>ā pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annāyo ti ādisu āpatti-pari<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edavase parimā<i>n</i>āyo <i>k</i>&#8217; eva appa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>annāyo <i>k</i>ā &#8217;ti attho. The only conclusion to be drawn from this is that the word is acc. fem. plur., and not an adverb. Compare chap. 33, below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> The text has a full paragraph for each of these cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> This chapter is repeated below, chap. 33, for the cases in which a new ordination has followed after the offences have been committed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>imasmi<i>m</i> āpattikkhandhe ti eko &#8217;va so āpattikkhandho, pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>āditattā pana pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>imasmi<i>m</i> āpattikkhandhe ti vutta<i>m</i>. Purimasmin ti etthāpi es&#8217; eva nayo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> See the close of the last note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> This section should correspond to chap. 31, section 2, but as noted by H. O. in his edition of the text, p. 312, there is very great confusion in the MSS. We ought to have four cases of which the distinctions are as under. Those offences</p>

					<p class="lgqt">All these four cases are required to make up the one hundred cases mentioned in the title at the close of chap. 30; but the first is altogether omitted in the text, and the others are not properly discriminated. We have supplied the first in brackets, and corrected the others accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> See above, chap. 27, and Mahāvagga II, 22, 3; IX, 4, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The hundred cases are made up thus: Chap. 29, §§ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 contain each of them four cases (after our correction of 29. 2); so that chap. 29 gives altogether twenty cases. Then in chap. 30, each of these twenty cases is repeated in the four other cases there given; so that chap. 30 gives altogether eighty cases. Of these eighty cases, as usual, at the end of a repetition, the last (four cases) are set out in full.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> This section corresponds to chap. 29, section 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> This section corresponds to chap. 29, section 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> As laid down in chap. 31.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> This includes, of course, the two other cases of a Bhikkhu who has rendered himself liable to, or'is undergoing the Mānatta discipline.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> On the opposition of vavatthita and sambhinna, compare Minayeff Pātimokkha, p. 29, where these two expressions are used of language.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> The chapter is translated as it stands. To supply the implications involved, the words 'a Bhikkhu' at the beginning should be understood as 'a Bhikkhu undergoing probation, or liable to the Mānatta discipline, or undergoing the Mānatta discipline, or fit to be rehabilitated.' And the conclusion should be supplied as in chap. 28, except that the penalty in each case is not an additional probation, but a probation corresponding in length to the period which has elapsed since the first of those offences which the re-ordained Bhikkhu has concealed (either before or after the second ordination). The details are only worked out, in chap. 28, of the first of the several pairs here enumerated, and are intended to be supplied here for each of the other pairs in a similar way. All the pairs recur in chaps. 35, 36.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Compare chap. 23, § 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> The concluding words of the last paragraph are here repeated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Missakan ti thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>ayād&icirc;hi missita<i>m</i>; that is an act which involves not only a Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa, but also some one or other of the lesser offences. Compare the use of missaka at <i>G</i>ātaka II, 420, 433, and at Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta, ed. Childers, p. 22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> The concluding words of the last paragraph are here repeated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> That is, any offence less than a Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa. The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Suddhakan ti Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa<i>m</i> vinā lahukāpattikkhandham eva.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> It is probably to be understood that a like rule is to apply in the other similar cases mentioned in the last paragraph of chap. 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> See chap. 33 for this list.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> In accordance with the rule laid down in chap. 28, which shows that by 'a Bhikkhu' must be understood 'a Bhikkhu who is under probation;' and the offences he has committed must have been concealed by him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Akuppa. The technical term kamma<i>m</i> kopeti is not to revoke the valid decision of a kamma regularly held, but to show that the kamma by reason of some irregularity was no real kamma, and its whole proceedings therefore void. One may compare akuppā me <i>k</i>eto-vimutti spoken by the Buddha immediately after he had attained Nirvā<i>n</i>a under the Bo Tree (Ariyapariyosāna Sutta in H. O.'s 'Buddha,' p. 429) and the opposite idea in Sutta Nipāta IV, 3, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> These offences must be understood to be offences committed while under probation, and concealed. See the note on chap. 35, § 1.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr"><a id="note">NOTE</a> ON ABHIHA<i>T</i><i>TH</i>UM.</h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg440"><span class="f2 g"><b>[440]</b></span></a> In the 7th Nissaggiya, in the 34th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and in the 36th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya there occurs the phrase abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavāreyya, regarding the correct translation of which, as will be seen from the note on the first passage, we were in doubt. The connection is always 'if A should offer B,' &amp;c.; and the only difficulty is the force of the word abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> which precedes the 'should offer,' and in some way qualifies it. In all three passages the Old Commentary preserved in the Sutta-Vibhaŋga explains the two words abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavāreyya by 'Take just as much as you want' (yāvataka<i>m</i> i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>asi tāvataka<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hāhi), which does not solve the difficulty. On the following words of the third passage, however, the Old Commentary (see H. O., 'Vinaya Pitaka<i>m</i>,' vol. iv, p. 84) uses the word abhiharati in its usual sense of 'he brings up to, offers to, hands over to,' as practically equivalent to abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i> pavāreti; and Buddhaghosa, in the Samanta Pāsādikā on the 7th Nissaggiya, uses abhiharitvā as directly equivalent to abhiha<i>t</i><i>th</i>u<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now in a passage quoted from the Thera-gāthā in H. O.'s 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, and seine Gemeinde' (p. 425, note 1), nikkhamitu<i>m</i>na occurs as the gerund of nikkhamati instead of nikkhamitvāna. The existence in Prākrit of corresponding gerunds in -tu, -tu<i>m</i> for -tvā, and in -t&ucirc;<i>n</i>a, -tuā<i>n</i>a for -tvāna, is laid down in Hema<i>k</i>andra II, 146 (Pischel, vol. i, p. 62). And Professor Weber has given corresponding forms (āha<i>t</i><i>t</i>u, ka<i>t</i><i>t</i>u, &amp;c.) from the <i>G</i>ain dialect in his Bhagavat&icirc; I, p. 433.</p>

					<p class="f4">What we have in the phrase in question is therefore simply a gerund in -tu<i>m,</i> and the two words taken together mean, 'if A should lay before and offer to B,' &amp;c. The thing offered in one case is robes, in the other two cases food; and abhiharati is the usual word in Pāli for serving food, laying it before another person. Compare thāli-pāka-satāni abhihari at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 186; and the phrase bhattābhihāro abhihāriyittha constantly repeated in the Mahā-sudassana Sutta (Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas,' in the last paragraph of chap. II, § 12, 29, 31, 33, 37).</p>
