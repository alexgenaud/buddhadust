					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p1">1.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed Buddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> was staying at Rā<i>g</i>agaha in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, in the Kalandaka Nivāpa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>. And at that time no permission had been given to the Bhikkhus by the Blessed One with respect to dwellings. So the Bhikkhus dwelt now here, now there--in the woods, at the foot of trees, on hill-sides, in grottoes, in mountain caves, in cemeteries, in forests, in open plains, and in heaps of straw. And at early morn they came in from this place or from that place--from the woods (&amp;c., as before) decorous in their walking and turning, in their looking on or looking round, in stretching out their arms or in drawing them back, with eyes cast down, and dignified in deportment<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Now at that time the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha went at early morn to his garden. And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of <a id="pg158"><span class="f2 g"><b>[158]</b></span></a> Rā<i>g</i>agaha saw those Bhikkhus coming in from this place and from that place, from the woods (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to the end), and on seeing them he took pleasure therein<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>. And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha went up to those Bhikkhus, and said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, Sirs, I were to have dwellings erected for you, would you take up your abode in those dwellings?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not so, O householder. Dwellings have not been allowed by the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, Sirs, ask the Blessed One about it, and let me know.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, O householder,' said they, in assent to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha. And they went up to the Blessed One, and saluted him, and took their seats on one side. And when they were so seated, they said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, Lord, wishes to have dwellings erected for us. What, Lord, should be done?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, when he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, abodes of five kinds--Vihāras, A<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ayogas, storied dwellings, attics, caves<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Then those Bhikkhus went up to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, and said to him: 'The Blessed One, Sir, has allowed us dwellings; do, therefore, what seemeth to thee good.' And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha had sixty dwelling-places put up in one day.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg159"><span class="f2 g"><b>[159]</b></span></a> <a id="p1.4">1.4</a> And when the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha had completed those sixty dwelling-places, he went up to the place where the Blessed One was, and [invited him and the Bhikkhu Saŋgha for the morrow's meal; and so on, as usual<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>, down to the time when, after the meal, the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i] said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">I have had, Lord, these sixty dwelling-places made for the sake of merit, and for the sake of heaven. What am I to do, Lord, with respect to them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, O householder, dedicate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> these sixty dwelling-places to the Saŋgha of the four directions, whether now present, or hereafter to arrive.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Lord!' said the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in assent to the Blessed One, and he dedicated those sixty dwelling-places to the use of the Saŋgha of the four directions whether present or to come<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> Then the Blessed One gave thanks to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha in these verses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

							<p class="in2">'Cold he wards off and heat, so also beasts of prey,<br />
							And creeping things and gnats, and rains in the wet season.<br />
							And when the dreaded heated winds arise, they are kept off.<br />
							<a id="pg160"><span class="f2 g"><b>[160]</b></span></a> To give Vihāras to the Saŋgha, wherein in safety and in peace<br />
							To meditate and think at ease, the Buddha calls the best of gifts.<br />
							Let then the able man, regarding his own weal,<br />
							Have pleasant monasteries built, and lodge there learned men<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>.<br />
							Let him with cheerful mind give food to them, and drink,<br />
							Raiment, and dwelling-places, to the upright in heart.<br />
							Then shall they preach to him the Truth--The Truth dispelling every grief<br />
							Which Truth when here that man perceives He sins no more, and dies away<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Blessed One had given thanks to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha in these verses, he rose from his seat, and departed thence.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> And the people heard, saying, 'Vihāras have been allowed by the Blessed One.' And they built Vihāras zealously. Those Vihāras had no doors<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>, and snakes, scorpions, and centipedes got in.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg161"><span class="f2 g"><b>[161]</b></span></a> They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a door<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They made holes in the wall, and tied the door on with string or with creepers, These were eaten by mice and white ants; and when the things by which the doors had been tied on had been eaten away, the doors fell.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, door-posts and lintel, hollow like a mortar, for the door to revolve in, and projections to the door for it to revolve on.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The doors would not come to.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a hole to pass a string through with which to pull the door to, and a string for that purpose.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The doors could not be made fast<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, rings on the door for the bolt to work along in, blocks of wood fixed to the edge of the door-post and containing a cavity for the bolt to go into, a pin to secure the bolt by, and a bolt.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Bhikkhus were not able to open the door.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg162"><span class="f2 g"><b>[162]</b></span></a> 'I allow, O Bhikkhus, key-holes, and keys of three kinds--bronze keys, and keys of hard wood, and keys of horn.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When anybody unlocked them<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>, and entered, the Vihāras became unprotected.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a yantaka, and a pin to it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.2">2.2</a> Now at that time the Vihāras were thatched; and in the cold season they were cold, and in the hot season hot.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover them (with skins)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>, and to plaster them within and without.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Vihāras had no windows, and they were bad for the eyes, and had a disagreeable odour.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, windows of three kinds--windows made with railings <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>, windows made with network<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span>, and windows made with slips of wood<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg163"><span class="f2 g"><b>[163]</b></span></a> Squirrels and bats<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> entered through the opening for the window.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, window-blinds (or curtains)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The squirrels and bats still got in through the interstices between the blind (and the wall).</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, shutters, and rolls or bags (to fill up interstices with)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.3">2.3</a> Now at that time the Bhikkhus slept on the floor, and both their limbs and their robes became dirty.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, mats made of grass.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The mats were eaten by mice and white ants.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, a solid bench or divan (built up against the wall of a room, or under the verandah against the outside wall of the house)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg164"><span class="f2 g"><b>[164]</b></span></a> On the solid bench their limbs ached.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bedsteads made of laths of split bamboo<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a bier-like masāraka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span> bedstead--a masāraka chair--a bier-like bundikābaddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span> bedstead--a bundikābaddha chair--a bier-like kul&icirc;ra-pādaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> bedstead--a kul&icirc;ra-pādaka chair--a bier-like āha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a-pādaka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span> bedstead--an āha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a-pādaka chair--had come into the possession of the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg165"><span class="f2 g"><b>[165]</b></span></a> They told this matter (in each case) to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, (each of these things).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.4">2.4</a> Now at that time a rectangular chair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span>--an arm-chair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span>--a sofa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span>--a sofa with arms to it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span>--a state chair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span>--a cushioned chair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span>--a chair raised on a pedestal<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span>--a chair with many legs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span>--a board (to recline on)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span>--a cane-bottomed chair<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span>--a straw-bottomed chair--had come into the possession of the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter (in each case) to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, (each of these things).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg166"><span class="f2 g"><b>[166]</b></span></a> <a id="p2.5">2.5</a> Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus slept on lofty beds.</p>

					<p class="f4">People coming on a visit to the Vihāra, when they saw them, murmured, &amp;c., saying, 'Like those who still live in the pleasure of the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to sleep on lofty beds. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain Bhikkhu, when sleeping on a low couch, was bitten by a snake<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, supports to your bedsteads<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used lofty supports to their bedsteads, and rocked themselves with these bedstead supports, backwards and forwards<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to use lofty supports to your bedsteads. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a. I allow you such supports up to eight inches in length.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.6">2.6</a> Now at that time a quantity of string had come into the possession of the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to weave (a texture of string across) the bedstead.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Much string was taken up by (passing it round) the sides of the bedstead.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg167"><span class="f2 g"><b>[167]</b></span></a>'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to pierce the sides of the bedstead, and thus to weave the string across and across<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to use it as a carpet<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">A mattress stuffed with cotton<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span> had come into their possession.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to comb out the cotton, and make the cotton up into pillows<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span> if it be of any of these three kinds--cotton produced on trees, cotton produced on creepers, cotton produced from Po<i>t</i>aki-grass.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus made use of pillows half the size of a man's body.</p>

					<p class="f4">People who came on a visit to the Vihāras murmured, &amp;c., on seeing this, saying, 'Like those who still enjoy the pleasures of the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.7">2.7</a> Now at that time there was a festival on a high place<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span> at Rā<i>g</i>agaha. The people provided for the use of high officials bolsters stuffed with wool, or cotton cloth, or bark, or grass, or leaves. When the festival had been held they tore open the covers of skin and carried them off. And the Bhikkhus saw much wool, and cotton cloth, and bark, and grass, and leaves thrown away on the spot where the festival had been held; and on seeing this, they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, bolsters<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span> of five kinds--those stuffed with wool, or cotton cloth, or bark, or grass, or talipot leaves.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to cover a bolster with it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the Bhikkhus folded up bed bolsters on to chairs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span>, and chair bolsters on to bedsteads, and the bolsters came to pieces.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, chairs and bedsteads covered (with upholstered cushions to fit them).'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, first to spread out a cloth under the bedsteads or chairs, and then to upholster them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They tore off the coverings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span>, and took them away.</p>

Would it be possible for us, at this very time, to go and visit that Blessed One, the Arahat, the very Buddha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn98" href="#n98">98</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not now, O householder, the proper time to pay a visit to the Blessed One; but early on the morrow you shall go and visit him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika, pondering of the visit he was about to pay, lay down to sleep with his thoughts so bent upon the Buddha that thrice in the night he arose, thinking the daylight had appeared.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.3">4.3</a> And Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder went up to the gate leading to the S&icirc;tavana, and celestial beings opened the gate. And as he emerged from the city, the light disappeared and a thick darkness arose, and fear and trembling and consternation sprang up within him, so that a longing came upon him to turn back again from that spot. But S&icirc;vaka the Yakkha, himself the while invisible, caused a sound to be heard, saying:</p>

					<p class="f4">'A hundred elephants, a hundred steeds, a hundred chariots with mules<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn99" href="#n99">99</a>]</sup></span>,</p>

					<p class="f4">[And a second and a third time the same thing happened, and the same words were heard, and with the same result.]</p>

And when he was so seated, he addressed Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come hither, Sudatta!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika, glad and happy at the thought that the Blessed One had addressed him by his name, went up to the place where the Blessed</p>

					<p class="f4">One was, and bowed down before him, falling at his feet, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I trust my lord the Blessed One has slept in peace!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He ever sleeps in peace, the Arahat who is free<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn100" href="#n100">100</a>]</sup></span>, <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> 'Who is not touched by lusts, but calm and free from sin<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn101" href="#n101">101</a>]</sup></span>,</p>

Then the Blessed One discoursed to Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder in due order; that is to say, he spake to him of giving, of righteousness, of heaven, of the danger, the vanity, and the defilement of lusts, and of the advantages of renunciation. And when the Blessed One saw that Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had become prepared, softened, unprejudiced, and upraised and believing in heart, then he proclaimed that which is the special doctrine of the Buddhas; that is to say, Suffering, its Origin, its Cessation, and the Path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stain has been washed away will readily take the dye, just even so did Anātha <a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth; (that is to say, the knowledge that) whatsoever has a beginning, in that is inherent also the necessity of dissolution. Thus did Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder see, and master, and understand, and penetrate the Truth; and he overcame uncertainty, and dispelled all doubts, and gained full knowledge, becoming dependent upon no one else for his knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher. And he addressed the Blessed One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Most excellent, Lord (are the words of thy mouth), most excellent! Just as if a man were to set up that which is thrown down, or were to reveal that which is hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms just even so, Lord, has the Truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the Blessed One. And I, even I, betake myself, Lord, to the Blessed One as my refuge, to the Truth, and to the Order. May the Blessed One accept me as a disciple, as one who, from this day forth as long as life endures. has taken his refuge in him. And may the Blessed One consent to accept at my hand the to-morrow's meal for himself and for his Order of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, by silence, granted his consent. And when Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder perceived that his request had been granted, he rose from his seat, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and keeping him on his right hand as he passed him, he departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.6">4.6</a> Now the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha heard that the <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> Order of Bhikkhus which has the Buddha at its head had been invited by Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder for the morrow's meal.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.7">4.7</a> Then Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, when the night was far spent, made ready in the house of the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha sweet food both hard and soft, and had the time announced to the Blessed One, saying, 'The time, Lord, has come; and the meal is ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, when he had dressed himself in the early morning, went duly bowled and <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> robed to the house of the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, and sat down there on the seat spread out for him, together with the Order of Bhikkhus. And Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder offered to the Order of Bhikkhus which had the Buddha at its head the sweet food both hard and soft, waiting upon them with his own hand<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn107" href="#n107">107</a>]</sup></span>. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his hands and his bowl, Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika took his seat on one side; and, so seated, he said to the Blessed One: 'May the Blessed One consent to spend the rainy season of Was at Sāvatthi, together with the Order of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Tathāgatas, O householder, take pleasure in solitude.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand, O Blessed One; I understand, O Happy One' (was the reply)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn108" href="#n108">108</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, after he had instructed and aroused and incited and gladdened Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder with religious discourse, arose from his seat, and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.8">4.8</a> Now at that time Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had many friends and' large acquaintance, and his word was held of weight<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn109" href="#n109">109</a>]</sup></span>.

					<p class="f4">And when Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had arrived at Sāvatthi, he examined all the region round about it, saying<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn110" href="#n110">110</a>]</sup></span>, 'Where now shall I fix the place for the Blessed One to stay in, not too far from the town and not too near, convenient for going and for coming, easily accessible for all who wish to visit him, by day not too crowded, by night not exposed to too much noise and alarm, protected from the wind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn111" href="#n111">111</a>]</sup></span>, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.9">4.9</a> And Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder saw that the garden of <i>G</i>eta the Kumāra had [all these advantages]. And when he saw that, he went to <i>G</i>eta the Kumāra, and said to him, 'Sir, let me have your garden to make an &Acirc;rāma on it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not, Sir, for sale, even for (a sum so great that the pieces of money would be sufficient to cover it if they were) laid side by side.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I take, Sir, the garden at the price.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'No, O householder, there was no bargain meant<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn112" href="#n112">112</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg188"><span class="f2 g"><b>[188]</b></span></a> Then they asked the lords of justice whether a bargain of sale had been made or not. And the lords decided thus: 'The &Acirc;rāma is taken, Sir, at the price which you fixed.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder had gold brought down in carts, and covered the <i>G</i>etavana with (pieces) laid side by side<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn113" href="#n113">113</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.10">4.10</a> Now the gold that he had brought down the first time did not suffice (after the rest of the garden was covered) to cover one small space close by the gateway. So Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder told his servants to go back and fetch more gold, saying he would cover that piece also.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then thought <i>G</i>eta the Kumāra, 'This can be no ordinary matter<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]</sup></span> for which this householder is ready to lavish so much gold!' And he said to Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder, 'It is enough, O householder. You need not have that space covered. Let me have that space, and it shall be my gift.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder thought<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn115" href="#n115">115</a>]</sup></span>, 'This <i>G</i>eta the Kumāra is a very distinguished and illustrious person. Great would be the efficacy of the adherence of so well known a man as he to this doctrine and discipline.' And he gave up that <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> space to <i>G</i>eta the Kumāra. And <i>G</i>eta the Prince erected thereon a gateway, with a room over it.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika the householder built<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn116" href="#n116">116</a>]</sup></span> dwelling-rooms, and retiring-rooms, and store-rooms (over the gateways), and service halls, and halls with fire-places in them, and storehouses (outside the Vihāra)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn117" href="#n117">117</a>]</sup></span>, and closets, and cloisters, and halls for exercise, and wells, and sheds for the well<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn118" href="#n118">118</a>]</sup></span>, and bath-rooms, and halls attached to the bath-rooms, and ponds, and open-roofed sheds<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn119" href="#n119">119</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5.1">5.1</a> Now when the Blessed One had stayed at Rā<i>g</i>agaha as long as he thought fit, he set out towards Vesāl&icirc;; and journeying straight on he in due course arrived there. And there at Vesāl&icirc; the Blessed One stayed in the peak-roofed hall at the Mahāvana.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the people were zealously engaged in putting up new buildings (for the use of the Order)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn120" href="#n120">120</a>]</sup></span>, and as zealously provided with the <a id="pg190"><span class="f2 g"><b>[190]</b></span></a> requisite clothes, and food, and lodging, and medicine for the sick, all such Bhikkhus as superintended their work.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain poor tailor thought; 'This can be no every-day matter on which the people are so zealously engaged. Let me too set to work on a new building.' And that poor tailor himself kneaded the clay, and laid the bricks, and raised the walls. But by his want of experience the laying was out of line and the wall fell down. And a second and a third time he [repeated his work, and with the same result].</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5.2">5.2</a> Then that poor tailor murmured, was annoyed, and became indignant, saying, 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as exhort and teach those men who provide them with the requisite clothes, food, lodging, and medicine, and superintend their buildings for them. But I am poor, and no one exhorts or teaches me, or helps me in my building!'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus heard him so murmuring, and told the matter to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection made a religious discourse, and gave command to the Bhikkhus, saying, 'I permit you, O Bhikkhus, to give new buildings in course of erection (for the use of the Order) in charge (to a Bhikkhu who shall superintend<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn121" href="#n121">121</a>]</sup></span> the work). And the Bhikkhu who <a id="pg191"><span class="f2 g"><b>[191]</b></span></a> is overseer shall zealously exert himself to the end that the work on the Vihāra may be brought to a rapid conclusion, and shall afterwards cause repairs to be executed wherever the buildings have become broken or worn out<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn122" href="#n122">122</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5.3">5.3</a> 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the work to be given in charge. In the first place a Bhikkhu is to be asked (whether he will undertake the duty). When he has been asked, some able and discreet Bhikkhu is to lay the matter before the Saŋgha, saying, "Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. If the time seems meet to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha give in charge to such and such a Bhikkhu the Vihāra of such and such a householder as a navakamma<i>m</i>. This is the motion (<i>ñ</i>atti). Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. The Saŋgha hereby gives in charge . . . . (&amp;c., as before).

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg192"><span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span></a> Now at that time the pupils of the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus went on in front of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha which had the Buddha at its head, and occupied the rooms, and occupied the sleeping-places, saying, 'This will do for our superiors (upa<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āyas), this for our teachers (ā<i>k</i>ariyas), this for ourselves.' And the venerable Sāriputta who had followed after the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha which had the Buddha at its head, since all the rooms and all the sleeping-places had been occupied, found no place to sleep in, and took his seat at the foot of a certain tree.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the Blessed One, at early dawn, after he had risen, coughed. The venerable Sāriputta coughed also.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Who is this?' (said the Blessed One.)</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is I, Lord; Sāriputta.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'How do you come to be sitting here, Sāriputta?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Sāriputta told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6.2">6.2</a>Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and asked, 'Is it true, as I have been told, O Bhikkhus, that the pupils of the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus have (acted in this way)?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One rebuked them, saying (as usual, see <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 2, 3), and he said to the Bhikkhus, 'Who is it, O Bhikkhus, who is worthy of the best seat, and the best water, and the best food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some of the Bhikkhus said, 'One who belonged to a Kshatriya family before he entered the Order.' Others of the Bhikkhus said, One who belonged to a Brahman family before he entered the Order.' Others again said, 'One who belonged to a <a id="pg193"><span class="f2 g"><b>[193]</b></span></a> Gahapati<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn124" href="#n124">124</a>]</sup></span> family before he entered the Order--one versed in the Suttas--one versed in the Rules of the Order--an expounder of the Dhamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn125" href="#n125">125</a>]</sup></span>--one who has attained the first, second, third, fourth <i>Gh</i>āna--one who has entered the first, second, third Path--an Arahat--one who has the threefold wisdom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn126" href="#n126">126</a>]</sup></span>--one who has the six powers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn127" href="#n127">127</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6.3">6.3</a> Then the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Long ago, O Bhikkhus, there was a great banyan tree on the lower slopes of the Himālaya range; and near it there dwelt three friends--a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant. And they dwelt together without mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn128" href="#n128">128</a>]</sup></span>. Then, O Bhikkhus, it occurred to those friends, "Come now, let us find out which of us is the elder by birth; and let us agree to honour and reverence and esteem and support him, and by his counsels let us abide." So, Bhikkhus, the partridge and the monkey asked the elephant,</p>

					<p class="f4">'"How far back can you, friend, remember?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Friends! when I was little I used to walk over <a id="pg194"><span class="f2 g"><b>[194]</b></span></a> this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and its topmost twig brushed against my stomach. So far back, friends, can I remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, O Bhikkhus, the partridge and the elephant asked the monkey [the same question],</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Friends! when I was little, sitting once on the ground, I gnawed at the then topmost twig of this banyan. So far back can I remember."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, O Bhikkhus, the monkey and the elephant asked the partridge [the same question],</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Friends! there was formerly a lofty banyan tree in yonder open space. One day after eating one of its fruits, I voided the seed here; and from that this banyan tree grew up. So I must be older than either of you."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thereupon, O Bhikkhus, the elephant and the monkey said to the partridge, "You, friend, are the oldest of us all. Henceforth we will honour and reverence and esteem and support you, and by your counsels will we abide."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thenceforth, O Bhikkhus, the partridge kept the monkey and the elephant in obedience to the Five Precepts, and observed them also himself. And dwelling together in mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy, at the dissolution of the body after death they were reborn unto a happy state in heaven. And this (perfect life of theirs) became known as "the good life of the partridge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn129" href="#n129">129</a>]</sup></span>."</p>

							<p class="in2">'Tis those who reverence the old<br />
							That are the men who Dhamma know,<br />

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6.4">6.4</a> 'So that, O Bhikkhus, since even animals can live together in mutual reverence, confidence, and courtesy, so much more, O Bhikkhus, should you so let your light shine forth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn130" href="#n130">130</a>]</sup></span> that you, who have left the world to follow so well taught a doctrine and discipline, may be seen to dwell in like manner together.' And when he had delivered a religious discourse (as in I, 1, 3), he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, that paying of reverence, rising up in reverence, salutation, proper respect, and apportionment of the best seat and water and food, shall be according to seniority.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6.5">6.5</a> 'These ten, O Bhikkhus, are not to be saluted--a Bhikkhu afterwards admitted unto the higher grade of the Order by one previously admitted--a person not admitted--a senior Bhikkhu when he belongs to a different community, and does not speak according to the Dhamma--a woman<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn132" href="#n132">132</a>]</sup></span>--a eunuch<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn133" href="#n133">133</a>]</sup></span>--a Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn134" href="#n134">134</a>]</sup></span>--one who, having been so placed, is <a id="pg196"><span class="f2 g"><b>[196]</b></span></a> liable to be thrown back to the beginning of his probationary term<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn135" href="#n135">135</a>]</sup></span>--one who is liable to have a penance (Mānatta) imposed upon him--one who is undergoing a penance--one who, so undergoing a penance, is fit to be rehabilitated.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And these three, O Bhikkhus, ought to be saluted--one previously admitted into the higher grade of the Order by one afterwards admitted--the senior in a different community when he speaks according to the Dhamma--and, O Bhikkhus, throughout the worlds of men and gods, of Māras and of Brahmas, by all creatures Sama<i>n</i>as and Brahmans, gods and men, the Arahat Sammāsambuddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p11.4">11.4</a> Now the apportioners of lodging-places thought, 'How then ought the lodging-places to be apportioned?'</p>

And many Bhikkhus, senior and junior, and of medium standing, went to learn the Vinaya under the venerable Upāli. The venerable Upāli taught them standing, out of reverence for the senior Bhikkhus, and the senior Bhikkhus heard him standing, out of reverence for the law; and thereby both the senior Bhikkhus grew weary, and the venerable Upāli.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Our readers will have noticed that the phrase at the beginning of each Khandhaka is 'the Blessed Buddha,' and not merely 'the Blessed One.' It recurs besides only in the constantly-repeated paragraph 'The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, &amp;c.' (see, for instance, <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 2, where the connection is given in full).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Compare the note on Mahāvagga III, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> So also Mahāvagga I, 23, 2, and frequently in the Suttas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> So also of Bimbisāra in the <i>G</i>ātaka Commentary, I, 66.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa's note on these pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a lenāni has already been given in our note above, Mahāvagga I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> See, for instance, Mahāvagga VI, 30, or <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 27.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Literally, 'establish' (pa<i>t</i>i<i>t</i><i>th</i>āpehi).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This formula of dedication has been constantly found in rock-inscriptions in India and Ceylon over the ancient cave-dwellings of Buddhist hermits. See Rh. D. in the 'Indian Antiquary' for May, 1872.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The following verses recur below at VI, 9, 2; and also in that connection in the <i>G</i>ātaka Commentary, I, 93.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This verse forms the subject of one of the 'Questions of Milinda' (ed. Trenckner, p. 211).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The above verses may have stood originally in a different con-text from that in which they have been handed down, as the opening phrase s&icirc;ta<i>m</i> pa<i>t</i>ihanti would be more intelligible if the word vihāro occurred in the immediately preceding clause.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Kavā<i>t</i>a. This is the special word for door. Dvāra often roughly translated door, is not really 'door,' but 'door-' or 'gate-way,' with special reference to the aperture and not to that by which the aperture could be closed. The latter word is also different from 'door,' in that it is never used for the entrance into an inner chamber. It is always the outer entrance (and the entrance at the front as distinguished from the entrance at the back) of a house, or one of the principal entrances to a walled town or village. See, for instance, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XIX; <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 1, VIII, 8, 1; <i>G</i>ātaka I, 63, 114, 346, 361, II, 63, 140.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> On this and the following details, compare V, 14, 3, and the notes there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Thak&icirc;yanti: literally, 'covered, or stopped, up.' The same word is used at <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 5, of closing up the lattices mentioned in the next section (VI, 2, 2).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Ugghā<i>t</i>etvā, an expression used in VIII, 1, 1 of undoing the bolt (gha<i>t</i>ikā) just referred to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Yantaka<i>m</i> s&ucirc;<i>k</i>ika<i>m</i>, which is the only expression here used which has not already occurred above at V, 14, 3. Buddhaghosa says, Yantaka-s&ucirc;<i>k</i>ikan ti ettha ya<i>m</i>&nbsp;ya<i>m</i> <i>g</i>ānāti ta<i>m</i>&nbsp;ta<i>m</i> yantaka<i>m</i>. Tassa vivara-s&ucirc;<i>k</i>ika<i>m</i> ku<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ika<i>m</i> kātu<i>m</i> va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Vedikā-vātapāna<i>m</i> nāma <i>k</i>etiye vedikā-sadisa<i>m</i> (B.). See our note on vedikā above, V, 14, 2. These windows or lattices are mentioned in <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 5; Mahāvagga I, 25, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> <i>G</i>āla-vātapāna<i>m</i> nāma <i>g</i>ālaka-baddha<i>m</i> (B.). <i>G</i>ālam, literally 'net,' is given as a word for 'window' at Abhidhānappadipikā, verse 216. The expression probably corresponds to our 'lattice,' and does not mean that an actual net was used. Compare the Anglo-Indian 'jalousie.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Salāka-vātapāna<i>m</i> nāma thambhaka-vātapāna<i>m</i> (B.). Possibly this means with slips of wood arranged horizontally as in our venetian blinds.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Vagguliyo. This habit of the bat and its harmlessness are referred to in Milinda Pa<i>n</i>ha, p. 404. Compare the Sanskrit valgul&icirc;.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>akkalikan ti. Ettha <i>k</i>olaka-pāda-pu<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>ana<i>m</i> bandhitu<i>m</i> anu<i>g</i>ānām&icirc; ti attho (B.). The word <i>k</i>akkali occurs below, VI, 19, probably in the sense here meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Vātapāna-bhis&icirc; ti vātapāna-pamā<i>n</i>ena bhisi<i>m</i> katvā bandhitu<i>m</i> anu<i>g</i>ānām&icirc; ti attho (B.). Probably like the sand-bags used in England to keep out draughts. On the use of the word in other connections, see our note on Mahāvagga VIII, 13, 1, and the Old Commentary on Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XIV (where five kinds are named) with the Kankhā-vitara<i>n</i>&icirc; on the last passage quoted by Minayeff, p. 86.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Mi<i>dh</i>im. See the note on V, 9, 4. Native huts in Ceylon always have such solid benches (of brick or mud covered with plaster) built up against the wall under the verandah: and they are commonly used as sleeping-places for the unmarried males in the house. Waska<i>d</i>uwa Subh&ucirc;ti has this in his mind in the explanation he gives in English of vedikā (Abhidhāna-ppad&icirc;pikā, verse 222), though he applies it to the wrong word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Bidala-ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>aka<i>m</i> nāma vetta-ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i>, ve<i>l</i>u-vil&icirc;vāhi vā v&icirc;ta<i>m</i> (B.). The word occurs in the <i>G</i>ātaka Commentary I, 9, lines 26, 34. Compare the Sanskrit bidala and vidala.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Masārako, on which Buddhaghosa says nothing here; but on the Old Commentary to the 14th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, where all the four words in this paragraph also occur, he has the following note (see Minayeff, p. 68): Masārako ti ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-pāde vi<i>g</i><i>gh</i>itvā tattha a<i>t</i>aniyo pavesetvā kato--just the opposite therefore of āha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a-pādako below. On a<i>t</i>ani, compare our note to the 87th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. The four names recur, of chairs only, in the Old Commentary on the 87th and 88th Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., says, Bundikābaddho ti a<i>t</i>an&icirc;hi ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-pāde <i>d</i>a<i>m</i>sāpetvā palla&#7749;ka-sa<i>m</i>khepema kato. The first word, bundika, may mean a small bolt.</p>

A bedstead or chair with curved or carved legs, especially when carved to represent animals' feet. Kul&icirc;ra is a crab.</p>

This is in agreement with the Old Commentary on the 18th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya in which this word already occurs. Compare āha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a in the &Acirc;yāranga S&ucirc;ya II, 1, 1, 2, II, 1, 10, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> &Acirc;sandiko. Buddhaghosa says, &Acirc;sandako (sic) ti <i>k</i>aturassapi<i>th</i>a<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati. An āsandi (cushioned chair) is forbidden at Mahāvagga V, 10, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> A<i>t</i><i>th</i>apadaka<i>m</i> vetu<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa says nothing, either here or at Mahāvagga VIII, 21, where the word also occurs. A<i>t</i><i>th</i>apada-<i>t</i><i>th</i>āpana at <i>G</i>ātaka II, 5, 14, is a mode of dressing the hair, probably in broad plaits crossing each other so as to resemble the squares of a chessboard.</p>

It is probably the same word as, or connected with, <i>k</i>imilikā, used by Buddhaghosa in note 5 on Mahāvagga VII, 1, 5, and explained by him (in Minayeff, p. 87, line 5) as tāla-pa<i>n</i><i>n</i>ād&icirc;hi katā. Both words are possibly diminutives of <i>k</i>ola, and it is not improbable that the reading should be <i>k</i>ilimikā in both cases, as Buddhaghosa so spells the word again in his note below on VI, 2, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> T&ucirc;lika. This is undoubtedly what is meant to be forbidden in § 5 of the Ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>ima S&icirc;la, although Grimblot, 'Sept Suttas Palis,' p. 9, reads kulika<i>m</i>. See Mahāvagga V, 10, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Compare IV, 4, 4, VIII, 1, 3, where such pillows are mentioned among the ordinary belongings of a Vihāra. The present rule is repeated below in VI, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Giragga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o. See our note above on V, 2, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Bhisi. See the note on this word at Mahāvagga VIII, 13, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says here ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-bhisi<i>m</i> p&icirc;<i>th</i>e sa<i>m</i>harant&icirc; ti ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-p&icirc;<i>th</i>e attharanti attharanatthāya harant&icirc; ti yu<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati (B.), On this use of sa<i>m</i>harati compare above, V, 11, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> Ulloka<i>m</i> akaritvā hetthā <i>k</i>ilimika<i>m</i> adatvā (B.). The word occurs again at Mahāvagga I, 25, 15 = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 3, where cobwebs are to be removed with a cloth (ullokā!).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> <i>Kh</i>avi<i>m</i>; but perhaps not necessarily of leather. See the commencement of this section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> So that the coverings would be useless for other purposes. The Pāli word is positu<i>m</i>, which Buddhaghosa explains thus--hesitun ti (so the Berlin MS.) ra<i>g</i>anena vā haliddhāya vā upari pusitāni dātu<i>m</i>. The word is evidently connected not with the root push, but with the roots p<i>ri</i>sh and prush, 'to be, spatter;' and is the same as phositun at Mahāvagga VI, 14, 5, which is probably the better reading of the two.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Bhatti-kamma<i>m</i>. The meaning is doubtful, because the reading is uncertain. Buddhaghosa says, Bhitti-kamman ti (sic) bhisi-<i>kh</i>aviyā upari bhitti-kamma<i>m</i>. The word is probably analogous in formation to our English 'patchwork,' though the 'patches' are not of pieces of different coloured stuffs, but of bits of different colour spread over the same stuff, and whatever its meaning, it is probably the same word as bhati-kamma at V, 9, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Again both reading and interpretation are open to question. Hattha-bhittin ti pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a&#7749;gula-bhitti<i>m</i> is all that Buddhaghosa says; and we have followed in our translation the reading of the Sinhalese MS. (see p. 321 of the edition of the text), which brings the word into connection with the preceding phrase.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> See V, 11, 6, where all these words recur.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Pā<i>n</i>ikāya. Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> Ikkāsa, on which we have nothing to add to Buddhaghosa's note at p. 321 of the edition of the text. It recurs below again in this section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-maddan ti pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-khala<i>m</i> (B.). Compare the Sanskrit m<i>ri</i>d.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-mattikan ti ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-missaka-mattika<i>m</i> (B.). Compare ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka-p&ucirc;vam in the <i>G</i>ātaka Commentary I, 423 (cakes made of flour mixed with this powder).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> Sāsapa-ku<i>t</i><i>t</i>an ti sāsapa-pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>am. The word has occurred already at Mahāvagga VI, 14, 5, where the reading is ku<i>t</i><i>t</i>a instead of ku<i>d</i><i>d</i>a given in the text here. The latter should be altered in accordance with that passage, and with Buddhaghosa here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Sittha-telakan ti vil&icirc;na-madhu-sitthaka<i>m</i> (B.). It is mentioned as used for hair-oil at <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 2, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> A<i>k</i><i>k</i>ussanna<i>m</i> hot&icirc; ti bindu<i>m</i>&nbsp;bindu<i>m</i> hutvā ti<i>t</i><i>th</i>ati, says Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>olakena pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>uddharitu<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa says pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>uttharitun ti mu<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>itu<i>m</i>; but compare for the right form V, 17, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> Ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>u-mattikan ti ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>uppāda-g&ucirc;tha-mattika<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Kasāvan ti āmalaka-hari<i>t</i>akāna<i>m</i> kasāva<i>m</i> (B.). Compare Mahāvagga VI, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>ibhāna-<i>k</i>itta<i>m</i>. The Bhikkhun&icirc;s were forbidden by the 41st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya of the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga to go and see such paintings. (Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga II, 298, where a picture gallery, <i>K</i>ittāgāra, belonging to King Pasenadi of Kosala, is mentioned.) We. are not quite sure of the connotation of the term, which appears to imply some reproach. Perhaps it means 'suggestive.' Figures as such were not forbidden; and remains of statues and bas reliefs erected in the Vihāras, illustrative of every-day life, have been found in great numbers. In the introductory story to the 26th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya it certainly means 'indecent.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> All these words occur above at V, 11, 6, and V, 14, 4. The meaning of the two last is very doubtful. Perhaps it is intended that these should occupy the space on the walls instead of any ornamentation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> &Acirc;lakamandā, literally, 'like Kuvera's city in heaven.' Buddhaghosa tells us why. &Acirc;lakamandā ti eka&#7749;ganā manussābhiki<i>n</i><i>n</i>ā. &Acirc;ki<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-yakkhā, corresponding to this last word, recurs in the standing description of &Acirc;lakamandā at Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta V, 43 = Mahā Sudassana Sutta I, 3. The name of the city is spelt in both those passages with <i>l</i> not l.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Sivikā-gabbho ti <i>k</i>aturassa-gahbho says Buddhaghosa.</p>

That na<i>li</i>kā is used like nā<i>li</i> for a bushel measure follows from a comparison of <i>G</i>ātaka 1,124, last lines, with I, 126, line 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> Hammiya-gahbho ti ākāsa-tale ku<i>t</i>āgāra-gabbho muda<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-<i>k</i><i>kh</i>adana-gabbho vā (B.). Compare our note on Mahāvagga I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> There is a similar injunction at V, 14, 3, with respect to fire-places in bath-rooms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Kula&#7749;ka-pādaka<i>m</i>. See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 321 of the edition of the text. The remedy here is different from that provided in the similar case, at V, 14, 3, with respect to bath-houses.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> On the use of ovassati compare V, 16, 1, and VIII, 3, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Parittāna-ki<i>t</i>ikan ti tassa parittānattha<i>m</i> ki<i>t</i>ika<i>m</i> is all that Buddhaghosa says. Compare the end of § 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> Uddha-sudhan ti va<i>k</i><i>kh</i>aka-gomayena <i>k</i>a <i>kh</i>arikāya <i>k</i>a saddhi<i>m</i> maddita-mattika<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> Vissara<i>m</i> akāsi. See the note on <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, I, where the whole incident is similar.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> The use of these has been already referred to at V, 9. 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> These have already been allowed in <i>K</i>ullavagga V, It, 6, and V, 14, 3. The license under the present rule extends only to their use in Vihāras.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> Apa<i>t</i>issaranā, which must have some special, technical, meaning unknown to us. Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> &Acirc;lindo nāma pamukha<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati (B.). Compare Abhidhāna-ppad&icirc;pikā, verse 218.</p>

At <i>G</i>ātaka III, 446, it is said of a dying man 'niharitvā osārake nipa<i>g</i><i>g</i>āpesu<i>m</i>.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> Sa<i>m</i>sara<i>n</i>a-ki<i>t</i>iko nāma <i>k</i>akkala-yutto ki<i>t</i>iko (B.). <i>K</i>akkala should be compared with <i>k</i>akkhalikā at VI, 2, 2, and <i>k</i>akkhali at VI, 19.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Ugghā<i>t</i>ana-ki<i>t</i>iko, on which Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> Ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka. See our note above on V, J4, 4, as to the various allied meanings of this word. Perhaps 'gateway' should be chosen as the rendering here, as it clearly must be in the closely allied passage in the next section but one (§ 10). As the chamber supposed always to be built over the gateway could be used as a store-room, the difference is not very essential.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> The whole as above in V, 14, 3, where see the note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> Uklāpo. On this use of the word compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII. 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> Uparope. Compare Uparopaka at <i>G</i>ātaka II, 345.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> Apesiyam. See p. 321 of the edition of the text, reading of course ka<i>n</i><i>th</i>aka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> Akkavā<i>t</i>a, on which Buddhaghosa says nothing. A kind of dress made from the stalks of the akka plant is mentioned in Mahāvagga VIII, 28, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Tosa<i>n</i>a, which is the ornamental erection over a gateway of which such excellent examples in stone have been found at the Sānchi and Bharhut Topes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> The exact meaning of the word Pāsāda at the time when this book was written has not yet been precisely ascertained. In later times it meant a building of several storeys, each successive storey being smaller in superficial area than the one immediately beneath it. Compare the Mahā-loha-pāsāda so often mentioned in the Mahāva<i>m</i>sa (pp. 161-257), the stone pillars of the lowest stories of which are still one of the sights of Anurādhapura.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> Uttari-bha&#7749;ga<i>m</i>. Childers sub voce uttari is in doubt what the meaning of this phrase is. It is no longer uncertain that the word means 'delicacy' of some sort. Whether the term was more precise, and denoted some particular delicacy or not, is still doubtful. Compare the passages quoted in our note above on Mahāvagga VI, 14, 3 (adding <i>G</i>ātaka I, 186, and <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 4, 5, VIII, 4, 4), which show that it was eaten with boiled rice or congey; is mentioned along with ghee and oil; and could be made from the flesh (or other parts) of a sucking-pig. If it were not for the latter circumstance (<i>G</i>ātaka I, 197) it might well be pickles or chutney.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> 'Much more so with the reality' is to be understood. Compare Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 63 (at the end).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> On this rendering of Sammā-sambuddha<i>m</i>, see Rh. D.'s Hibbert Lectures,' pp. 145-147.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> Assatari. Compare va<i>k</i><i>kh</i>atar&icirc; at Mahāvagga V, 9, 1, 3. The word recurs below at VII, 2, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> Brāhma<i>n</i>o parinibbuto. To translate the first of these words by 'Brahman' would mislead English readers. It is constantly used in early Buddhist texts for Arahat. On the use of parinibbuto not in the sense of 'dead,' but of a living man in the sense of 'spiritually free,' compare Dhammapada, verse 89; Sutta Nipāta II, 13, I, 12, III, 12, 35; and Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta IV, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> Nir&ucirc;padhi, i.e. free from Kāma, Kilesa, and Kamma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> Sabbā āsattiyo <i>kh</i>etvā. Having cut or broken all the āsatti's (from the root sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>, 'to hang'), the things which hang on to and burden a man in his spiritual progress. Compare the figure of speech at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 5 (āsatta<i>m</i> ku<i>n</i>apa<i>m</i> <i>kh</i>addetvā). Buddhaghosa says sabbā āsattiyo <i>kh</i>etvā ti . . . . hadaye daratha<i>m</i> <i>k</i>itte kilesa-daratha<i>m</i> <i>g</i>inetvā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Vineyya and appuya are no doubt gerunds. In a corresponding passage of the A&#7749;guttara Nikāya the Phayre MS. reads appeyya, which smoothes over a difficulty at the expense of the better reading.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> The following section is in identical terms with Mahāvagga I, 7, 5, 10, V, I, 9, 10, VI, 26, 8, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> Veyyāyika<i>m</i> formed from vyaya, expenditure. Veyyāyikan ti vayakara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> Rā<i>g</i>agahako negamo. This person has been already mentioned, and there also in intimate connection with the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in the Mahāvagga VIII, 1, 2, 16. It is tolerably clear from the connection that this is no ordinary citizen, but one holding a distinct and semi-official position. In this respect the word is an exact parallel to its neighbour the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i. For instances of the word in its more general sense, see Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana (ed. Senart), p. 219, and Dā<i>th</i>āva<i>m</i>sa III, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Compare the note on Mahāvagga I, 8, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> A<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>āta<i>m</i> bhagavā a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>āta<i>m</i> sugatā ti. The first word is the standing expression used when the Buddha or a Thera has signified a request, not in so many words, but in some phrase from which the request may be implied, and the person addressed desires to express that he has perceived the intended implication. Compare D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa XIV, 65, XV, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> Adeyyavā<i>k</i>o ti tassa va<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i> bahu<i>g</i>anā mānetabba<i>m</i> ma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ant&icirc; ti attho (B.). In Puggala III, 11, we have the phrase tassa va<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i> ādheyya<i>m</i> ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati, which the commentary explains by hadaye ādhātabba<i>m</i> <i>th</i>apitabba<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> The following speech is identical with that put into Bimbisāra's mouth on choosing the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, above Mahāvagga I, 22, 16, 17.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Vi<i>g</i>anavāta<i>m</i>, of which neither the reading nor the meaning is certain. See the various forms given from the commentaries in the notes on the text of the passage in the Mahāvagga, loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> Na gahito: literally, 'it is not taken.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> It is evident from the illustration of this story on a bas relief at the Bharhut Tope that these pieces of money were supposed to be square, not round. See Cunningham's 'The St&ucirc;pa of Bharhut,' Plate No. LVII and pp. 84-86.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> Na oraka<i>m</i> bhavissati. Compare Mahāvagga I, y, I, and the commencement of our next chapter below. The idiom recurs in VII, 3, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> The following phrase is identical with that put into the mouth of &Acirc;nanda, at Mahāvagga VI, 36, 3, with respect to Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla. In the text here there is a slight misprint; the full-stop after <i>ñ</i>ātamanusso should be struck out.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> With the following list should be compared the list of things that laymen build for themselves given in Mahāvagga III, 5, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> Kappiya-ku<i>t</i>iyo. See Mahāvagga VI, 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> Udapāna-sālāyo. See above, V, 16, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ape. See Mahāvagga VIII, 1, 1, and above, <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 3, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> Navakamma<i>m</i> karonti. This idiom always connotes buildings for the use of the Order. See the passages quoted in our note on <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 18, I. If the buildings were for the Bhikkhus, then a Bhikkhu, if for the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, then a Bhikkhun&icirc;, was appointed to superintend the works in order to ensure the buildings being in accordance with the rules of the Order as to size, form, and object of the various apartments.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The buildings referred to in this section are no doubt intended to be the same as those referred to in <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 13, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> Navakamma<i>m</i> dātu<i>m</i>. For the works which ought not to be included, and for those which might be lawfully included. in this term, see below, <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 17. Hence the overseer is called navakammika.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> Kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>an ti bhinnokāso: phullan ti phalitokāso (B.). The expression recurs below at VI, 17, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> The incident related in the following chapter is identical with the 37th <i>G</i>ātaka (including the Introductory Story there given) already translated by Rh. D. in the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 310-314.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a>]</sup> On this mention of gahapati as the name of a caste or rank, compare the passage in the Tevi<i>g</i><i>g</i>a Sutta I, 47 = Sāma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>aphala Sutta, p. 133 (translated by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' S.B.E. vol. xi, p. 187), where the word is opposed to a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atarasmi<i>m</i> kule pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>ā<i>g</i>āto.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a>]</sup> Dhamma is here possibly already used in the special sense to which the term Abhidhamma was afterwards applied. So Pu<i>n</i><i>n</i>a, who in the A&#7749;guttara Nikāya I, 14, is called the chief of the expounders of the Dhamma (compare D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa IV, 4), says of himself in the Apadāna abhidhammanaya<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>o &#8217;ha<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> Tittiriya<i>m</i> brahma<i>k</i>ariya<i>m</i>. It is quite possible that a covert sarcasm is here intended to be understood against the Taittir&icirc;ya Brahmans.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> Ta<i>m</i> sobhetha yam (one illegible word--JBH). On this idiom compare Mahāvagga X, 2, 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> Compare chapter and also chapter 12. It would seem from these passages that the prohibition to reserve exclusively according to seniority the use of property belonging to the whole Saŋgha was held to imply that the temporary use of it was to go according to seniority. Compare X, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> These are Nos. 1, 2, and 7 in the list just referred to, and may be kept if treated in the way laid down in VI, 14, 2 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> This rule has already occurred in identical terms at Mahāvagga V, 11. Probably both here and there the word such, which we have here added in brackets, is to be understood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> The usual terms are here followed throughout: see, for instance, above, VI, 4, 6, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> That is 'of all the world.' See our note above on Mahāvagga VIII, 27, 5, where the phrase has already occurred.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> The verses are quoted in the account of Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's gift given in the <i>G</i>ātaka commentary (Fausb&ouml;ll I, 93; Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' I, 131).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> &Acirc;nantarika<i>m</i>; perhaps 'the Bhikkhu (who happened to be) next (to him).' The text reads anantarika<i>m</i>, which is a misprint. Compare Mahāvagga IX, 4, 8, and <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 3, 9, VIII, 4, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> Compare the rule for Bhikkhun&icirc;s at X, 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> The story in this section forms also the introductory story to the 17th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> Pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>antima<i>m</i>; perhaps 'in the border-country.' Compare pa<i>k</i><i>k</i>anta<i>m</i> nagara<i>m</i>, a frontier fort at Dhammapada, p. 56.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n146" href="#fn146">146</a>]</sup> &Acirc;gametha yāva. Compare the introductory story to the 46th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> That is, under the 17th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n148" href="#fn148">148</a>]</sup> Senāsanam gāhetu<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa has nothing on this idiom, but its meaning is sufficiently clear from the connection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n149" href="#fn149">149</a>]</sup> Seyyaggena gāhetu<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa has no special explanation of agga here, but in his explanation of the passage says that this is to be so done that each Bhikkhu receives room for a couch (ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>t</i><i>th</i>ana<i>m</i>). Agga must here be agra, to which B&ouml;htlingk-Roth give, from Indian lexicographers, the subsidiary meaning of 'multitude.' So below in XII, 1, 1, the Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>iputtakas divide money amongst themselves bhikkhu-aggena, 'according to the number of the Bhikkhus.' Seyyā is here used in the same meaning as that in which senāsana is used throughout the rest of this chapter and the next. See VIII, 1, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n150" href="#fn150">150</a>]</sup> Ussādiyi<i>m</i>su. Buddhaghosa says ussārayi<i>m</i>s&ucirc; ti ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a<i>t</i><i>th</i>ānāni atirekāni ahesu<i>m</i>. His reading is in a copy of his work in Burmese characters, and is supported, both here and in Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XLVI, 2, where the word recurs, by a Burmese copy of the text. The Sinhalese reading is the correct one, but one may compare the idiom <i>g</i>ana<i>m</i>, or parisa<i>m</i>, ussāreti at Mahāvagga VIII, 1, 22, and <i>G</i>ātaka I, 419, 434. So at IX, I, 3, 4, the reading ussāreti given in the text is corrected at p. 363 into ussādeti, in accordance with the reading of the Sinhalese MS.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n151" href="#fn151">151</a>]</sup> The relation of the Vihāra to the Parive<i>n</i>a is here curious. In the later language parive<i>n</i>a means 'cells.' Here it evidently includes several vihāras.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> Anubhāgan ti puna apara<i>m</i> pi bhāga<i>m</i> dātu<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n153" href="#fn153">153</a>]</sup> Na akāmā is used here in a sense precisely parallel to that in which it occurs at Mahāvagga VII, 24, 4. See the passages quoted in our note there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n154" href="#fn154">154</a>]</sup> Niss&icirc;me <i>th</i>itassa. See on this phrase above, Mahāvagga VII, I, 5, and VIII, 2, 3. It is repeated below, VI, 17, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n155" href="#fn155">155</a>]</sup> These first two dates are the days on which the earlier and the later Vassa begins. See Mahāvagga III, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n156" href="#fn156">156</a>]</sup> These are the acts which render a Bhikkhu liable to the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya Kamma. See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n157" href="#fn157">157</a>]</sup> That is, by taking a lodging here you ipso facto renounced your right to a lodging there, and by taking one there you ipso facto renounced your right to get one here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n158" href="#fn158">158</a>]</sup> Compare the fifteen rules of a similar character, Sekhiyas 57-72, and especially No. 69.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup> Onlookers apparently, not strictly learners. On the force of pa<i>t</i>imāneti, compare the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pārā<i>g</i>ika I, 1, and <i>G</i>ātaka II, 423.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup> Hatthi-nakhaka<i>m</i>, 'supported on the frontal globes (kumbhe) of elephants,' says Buddhaghosa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n161" href="#fn161">161</a>]</sup> On the meaning of paribhoga here compare VI, 18, 1. The doubt here expressed is curious, as a storeyed building (pāsāda) is one of the five kinds of abodes (lenāni) specially sanctioned by Mahāvagga I, 30, 4, and <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 1, 2; and a verandah (ālinda) has been also authorised by <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 3, 5. No doubt the special point here is as to the carved pillars: but, even so, that this rule should be thus separated from the other rules as to buildings, in the commencement of this book (VI, 1-4), is a proof of the unsystematic way in which the Khandhakas have been put together. Even the final redaction which we have now before us contains much similar evidence of the gradual growth of these rules. See note 3 on the next paragraph.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> Compare the 87th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup> This rule has already been given in VI, 2, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup> It is distinctly laid down without any reservation in Mahāvagga V, 10, 5 (in the paragraph erroneously numbered V, 10, 4 in vol. ii, p. 28, of the present work), that the use of any of these things is a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. That this relaxation of that rule should be inserted only here, looks very much like an after-thought, even though the former passage merely refers to the use of these things as seats. This is more. especially noteworthy from the fact mentioned in the last note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The rules as to new rugs or mats to be used for sitting upon, are contained in the 11th to the 15th Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> This is a direct infringement of the 82nd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, which forbids property dedicated to the Saŋgha being diverted to the use of any individual.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup> On these Bhikkhus and their relations with Sāriputta and Moggallāna, see above, <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 13-16.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> These expressions 'untransferable' (avissa<i>g</i><i>g</i>iyāni) and 'unapportionable' (avebha&#7749;giyāni) have already occurred above at Mahāvagga VIII, 27, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> The Bhikkhus of &Acirc;<i>l</i>av&icirc; are frequently mentioned in connection with offences in relation to the navakamma<i>m</i>. See, for instance, Pārā<i>g</i>ika III, 5, 30.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> For the rule authorising such giving in charge in general cases, see above, VI, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup> For most of the following technical terms in building, see our notes above on <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 11, and V, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup> See our note on this phrase above, V, 11, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup> Ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikadhāna-mattenā ti dvāra-bāhāna<i>m</i> upari-kapo<i>t</i>a-ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika-yo<i>g</i>ana-mattena (B.). Ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>i is used in this sense at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 237. Compare the use of Dhamma-ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikā, 'block of execution,' at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 150, II, 124. The word ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikā occurs also at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 474 (last line), in the sense of 'bunch:' but it is there probably a misprint; for Oldenberg, in the parallel passage at Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya I, 1, reads bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ike. That the two words are easily confused in Burmese writing is shown by the fact that the Berlin (Burmese) copy of Buddhaghosa reads here also bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikādhāna-mattenā ti, &amp;c., and again afterwards bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup> See our note on this phrase above, VI, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup> Paribha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-kara<i>n</i>a-mattenā ti gomaya-paribha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-kasāva-parikara<i>n</i>a-mattena (B.). The very same expression is used in a wholly doubtful sense, and of some process of tailoring, in. Mahāvagga VII, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n175" href="#fn175">175</a>]</sup> Dh&ucirc;makālikan ti ida<i>m</i> yāv&#8217; assa <i>k</i>itaka-dh&ucirc;mo na pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>āyat&icirc;ti tāva aya<i>m</i> vihāro etass&#8217; evā ti eva<i>m</i> dh&ucirc;ma-kāle apaloketvā kata-pariyosita<i>m</i> vihāra<i>m</i> denti (B.). The word recurs below, applied to sikkhāpada<i>m</i>, in XI, 1, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n176" href="#fn176">176</a>]</sup> V&icirc;ppakatan ti ettha vippakato nāma yāva gopānasiyo na ārohanti. Gopānas&icirc;su pana āru<i>l</i>hāsu bahukato nāma hoti: tasmā tato pa<i>t</i><i>th</i>āya na dātabbo (B.). The use of bahukato is noteworthy. for in the only other passage where we have found the word (Mahāvagga VI, 36, 2), it has a totally different application. There is possibly a misreading in the one MS. available. (? pakato.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n177" href="#fn177">177</a>]</sup> See above, VI, 11, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n178" href="#fn178">178</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga II, 22, 3, and II, 36, 1-3. In the latter of these two passages the three cases are omitted. In Mahāvagga IX, 4, 2, and 8, the whole 23 are given.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n179" href="#fn179">179</a>]</sup> That is, the navakammiko loses his privileges (his lien on the best sleeping-place, &amp;c.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n180" href="#fn180">180</a>]</sup>Vihāra-paribhoga<i>m</i>. 'Meant for use only in that Vihāra.'. Compare above, VI, 14, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n181" href="#fn181">181</a>]</sup>Tāvakālika<i>m</i>. The word occurs in <i>G</i>ātaka I, 121, 393 (on which see Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 170, and 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 241), in Buddhaghosa's notes on Mahāvagga VII, 5, 1 (above, II, 154, note 7), in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXV, 2, and in <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 16, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n182" href="#fn182">182</a>]</sup>Saŋghassa vihāro udriyati. The whole phrase has already occurred at Mahāvagga III, 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n183" href="#fn183">183</a>]</sup> Because such things were forbidden by Mahāvagga V, 10, 4, though kambala is not there specially mentioned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n184" href="#fn184">184</a>]</sup> Phātikammatthāyā ti va<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ikammatthāyā ti.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n185" href="#fn185">185</a>]</sup> According to VI, 2, 2, and VI, 3, 5, this could also be used as a screen or curtain over the space in a wall left for a window.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n186" href="#fn186">186</a>]</sup> According to Mahāvagga VIII, 18, this might be used to wipe faces with; and according to <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 9, 4, VI, 19, to place crockery or furniture on. The word <i>k</i>ola means simply cotton cloth, but it is clear from these passages that <i>k</i>olaka has some special connotation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n187" href="#fn187">187</a>]</sup> Not to sit upon.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n188" href="#fn188">188</a>]</sup>With this should be compared the other rule in Mahāvagga V, 6, 1, according to which the Bhikkhus were to wear sandals when getting upon bedsteads or chairs, lest these should become soiled. The two passages are parallel in wording throughout.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n189" href="#fn189">189</a>]</sup>Parikammakatāya. The floors were of earth, not of wood, and were restored from time to time by fresh clay or dry cowdung being laid down, and then covered with a whitewash, in which sometimes black or red (geruka) was mixed. See above, V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 1; 17, 1; 27. From the parallel passage at Mahāvagga I, 25, 15, and <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 3, 1, it would seem that the red colouring was used rather for walls, and the black one for floors.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n190" href="#fn190">190</a>]</sup>'The walls were no doubt usually made with 'wattle and daub;' that is, sticks with clay between the interstices. This was treated from time to time like the flooring (see last note).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n191" href="#fn191">191</a>]</sup>Apassena-phalaka<i>m</i>. This article of furniture is mentioned, with the spittoon, in Mahāvagga I, 45, 15, 16, and in the parallel passage at <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 3. We have rendered it in the Mahāvagga by 'board to recline on.' Compare the use of apassaya<i>m</i> in Buddhaghosa's note on <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 2, 4 (above, p. 153, note 3) of an arm-chair or sofa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n192" href="#fn192">192</a>]</sup>Dhotapādakā ti dhotapādakā hutvā dhotehi pādehi akkamitabba<i>t</i><i>h</i>āne nipa<i>g</i><i>g</i>itu<i>m</i> kukku<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyanti. Dhotapādake ti pi pā<i>th</i>o. Dhotehi pādehi akkamitabba<i>t</i><i>th</i>ānass&#8217; eva eta<i>m</i> adhiva<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n193" href="#fn193">193</a>]</sup> Other special rules for times of scarcity will be found at Mahāvagga VI, 17, 7; 18, 4; 19, 2; 20, 4 (repealed for times of plenty in VI, 32). Compare also Pārā<i>g</i>ika IV, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n194" href="#fn194">194</a>]</sup> The above modes of receiving food (instead of collecting in a bowl morsels of food given in alms) are the dispensations allowed by Mahāvagga I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n195" href="#fn195">195</a>]</sup> Uddesa-bhatta<i>m</i> <i>k</i>ātu<i>m</i>. Compare the story of Upananda at Mahāvagga VI, 19, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n196" href="#fn196">196</a>]</sup> Nimantana<i>m</i> kātu<i>m</i>. The word is only used in this special technical sense. Compare the whole story of <i>K</i>ulla-panthaka at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 116, and especially the last line.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n197" href="#fn197">197</a>]</sup> Salāka-bhatta<i>m</i> <i>k</i>ātu<i>m</i>. See especially above, <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 9; IV, to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n198" href="#fn198">198</a>]</sup> Pakkhika<i>m</i> <i>k</i>ātu<i>m</i>. Both Childers sub voce and Frankfurter ('Pali Handbook,' p. 165), in interpreting the passage at Mahāvagga I, 30, 4, take this to mean a feast given on the eighth day of the month. But paksha is the half-month. The expression much more probably means, therefore, to provide food either during the whole of a half-month for one or more specially invited Bhikkhus, or for a larger number on any one day of the half-month to be chosen by the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n199" href="#fn199">199</a>]</sup> Compare above, <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 4, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n200" href="#fn200">200</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Salākāya vā pa<i>t</i>ikāya vā upanibandhitvā opu<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>itvā uddisitun ti va<i>k</i>anato rukkhasāramayāya salākāya vā ve<i>l</i>uvilivatālapa<i>n</i><i>n</i>ādinayāya pa<i>t</i>ikāya vā asukassa nāma salākabhattan ti eva<i>m</i> akkharāni upanibandhitvā pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>iya<i>m</i> vā <i>k</i>&icirc;varabhoge vā katvā sabbā salākāyo omu<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>itvā [sic] punappuna<i>m</i> he<i>t</i><i>th</i>ā-vasena ā<i>l</i>oletvā . . . dātabbā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n202" href="#fn202">202</a>]</sup> Dhamma-karako. See V, 13, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n203" href="#fn203">203</a>]</sup> On these words, see Mahāvagga VIII, 12, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n204" href="#fn204">204</a>]</sup> On these two words, see Mahāvagga VIII, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n205" href="#fn205">205</a>]</sup> These things were to be used only as medicines, according to Mahāvagga VI, 1, 1-5, where butter is also added. That would be under the charge of the distributor of dry foods (§ 2), as if kept it would go bad. According to VI, 15, 10, none of these five kinds of medicine were to be kept for a period exceeding seven days, but that was a rule that was not very probable to be strictly followed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n206" href="#fn206">206</a>]</sup> Sā<i>t</i>iya; no doubt the same as is spelt elsewhere sā<i>t</i>ikā or sā<i>t</i>akā, and is used for such purposes as bathing in.</p>
