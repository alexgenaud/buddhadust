					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was dwelling at Sāvatthi, in the &Acirc;rāma of Anāthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika. And at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to carry out the formal Acts--the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya, and the Nissaya, and the Pabbā<i>g</i>aniya, and the Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya, and the Ukkhepaniya--against Bhikkhus who were not present.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Bhikkhus who were modest were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus [act thus]<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>?' And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus carry out the (aforesaid)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> formal Acts against Bhikkhus who are not present?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'This is improper (&amp;c., as in I, 1, 2, down to the end).' And when he had thus rebuked them, and had <a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'The formal Acts, O Bhikkhus, the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-, the Nissaya-, the Pabbā<i>g</i>aniya-, the Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya-, and the Ukkhepaniya-kammas, ought not to be carried out against Bhikkhus who are not present. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> The single Bhikkhu who speaks not in accordance with the right, the many who speak not in accordance with the right, the Saŋgha which speaks not in accordance with the right. The single Bhikkhu who speaks in accordance with the right, the many who speak in accordance with the right, the Saŋgha which speaks in accordance with the right<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4">Now (it may happen that) the one Bhikkhu who speaks not in accordance with the right may point out (the right course) to a single Bhikkhu who speaks in accordance with the right, or gives him to understand what it is<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, or urges him to see or consider the matter in that light<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>, or teaches him, or <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> instructs him, saying, 'This is the Dhamma, this the Vinaya, this the teaching of the Master. Accept this, and approve this.' If the dispute should be thus settled, it is settled contrary to the Dhamma, and with a mere counterfeit of the Vinaya rule of procedure (that cases of dispute must be settled before a duly constituted meeting of the Saŋgha, and in the presence of the accused person)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">[And in like manner, if he instruct the many, or the Saŋgha, who speak according to the right;--or if the many or the Saŋgha who speak not according to the right instruct the one, or the many, or the Saŋgha who speak according to the right;-then the dispute is settled contrary to the Dhamma (&amp;c., as before).]</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">End of the nine cases in which the right side decides.</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p4">4.</a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.1">4.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in the Kalandaka Nivāpa, in the Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Dabba the Mallian, who had realised Arahatship when he was seven years old, had entered into possession of every (spiritual gift) which can be acquired by a disciple; there was nothing left that he ought still to do, nothing left that he ought to gather up of the fruit of his past labour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>. And when the venerable Dabba the Mallian had retired into solitude, and was sunk in thought, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'Arahatship had I <a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> acquired when I was seven years old. I have gained everything that a learner can reach to. There is nothing further left for me to do, nothing to gather up of the fruit of that which I have done. What service is it possible for me to render to the Saŋgha?' And it occurred to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: 'It would be a good thing for me to regulate the lodging-places for the Saŋgha, and to apportion the rations of food.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.2">4.21</a> And when, at eventide, the venerable Dabba the Mallian had arisen from his meditations, he went to the place where the Blessed One was; and when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side; and when he was so seated the venerable Dabba the Mallian spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I had retired, Lord, into solitude and was sunk in thought, the following consideration presented itself to my mind (&amp;c., as before, down to) It would be a good thing for me to regulate the lodging-places for the Saŋgha, and to apportion the rations of food. I desire, Lord, [so to do].'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, Dabba. Do you then regulate the lodging-places for the Saŋgha, and apportion the rations of food!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is well, Lord,' said the venerable Dabba the Mallian, accepting the word of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.3">4.3</a> And the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection, when he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let then the Saŋgha, O Bhikkhus, appoint Dabba the Mallian as the regulator of lodging-places, and as the apportioner of rations. And thus, O Bhikkhus, should the appointment be made.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> 'First Dabba should be asked (whether he is willing to undertake the office). When he has been asked, some able and discreet Bhikkhu should lay the resolution before the Saŋgha, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me.</p>

					<p class="f4">'"If it be convenient to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha appoint Dabba the Mallian as regulator of lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. '"This is the resolution (<i>ñ</i>atti).</p>

					<p class="f4">'"Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me.</p>

					<p class="f4">'"The Saŋgha appoints the venerable Dabba the Mallian as regulator of lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. Whosoever of the venerable ones agrees that Dabba should be so appointed, let him remain silent; whosoever does not agree, let him speak. The venerable Dabba is appointed by the Saŋgha as regulator of the lodging-places, and as apportioner of rations. The Saŋgha approves thereof. Therefore is it silent. Thus do I understand."'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.4">4.4</a> And the venerable Dabba the Mallian, being so chosen, appointed one lodging-place in the same place for the Bhikkhus who belonged to the same division. For those Bhikkhus who were repeaters of the Suttantas he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to chant over the Suttantas to one another.' For those Bhikkhus who were in charge of the Vinaya he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to discuss the Vinaya one with another.' For those Bhikkhus who were preachers of the Dhamma he appointed a lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will be able to talk over the Dhamma one with another.' For those Bhikkhus who were given to <a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> meditation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> he appointed one lodging-place together, thinking, 'They will not disturb one another.' For those Bhikkhus who were wise in worldly lore, and abounding in bodily vigour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>, he appointed one lodging-place together, thinking, 'These venerable ones, too, will thus remain settled according to their pleasure.' And for such Bhikkhus as came in late, for them he caught fire,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span> and by the light of the flame thereof he pointed out to them a lodging-place.</p>

					<p class="f4">So much so<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> that Bhikkhus of set purpose would come in late, thinking, 'We shall thus behold the power of the Iddhi of the venerable Dabba the Mallian.' And they went up to the venerable Dabba the Mallian, and said: 'Appoint us, O venerable Dabba, a lodging-place.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And to them the venerable Dabba the Mallian would speak thus: 'Where do the venerable ones desire to rest? Where shall I appoint it?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And they of set purpose would designate some place afar, saying, 'May the venerable Dabba appoint us a lodging-place on the Vulture's Peak; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Robber's Cliff; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Black Rock on the Isigili Passa; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging on the Vebhāra Passa; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Sattapa<i>n</i><i>n</i>i Cave; may the <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the mountain cave of the Snake's Pool in S&icirc;ta's Wood; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Goma<i>t</i>a Grotto; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the cave of the Tinduka Tree; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place at the Tapoda Ghāt; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the Tapoda &Acirc;rāma; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka's Mango Grove; may the venerable one appoint us a lodging-place in the deer-park at Maddaku<i>k</i><i>kh</i>i.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable Dabba the Mallian would burst into flame, and walk on in front of them with his finger burning, and they by the light thereof would follow close upon the venerable Dabba the Mallian. And the venerable Dabba the Mallian would appoint them a lodging-place, saying, 'This is the couch, and this the stool, and this the mat, and this the pillow, and this the privy place, and this the drinking-water<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>, and this the water for washing, and this the staff<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>, and this the form of (the result of) the consultation of the Saŋgha<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>, that at such and such a time are you to enter thereon, and at such and such a time are you to depart therefrom<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>.' And when the <a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> venerable Dabba the Mallian had thus appointed unto them their lodging-place, he would return back again to the Bamboo Grove.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.5">4.5</a> Now at that time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> had been but recently received into the Saŋgha, and were wanting in merit, and such among the lodging-places appertaining to the Saŋgha as were inferior fell to their lot, and the inferior rations<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the people of Rā<i>g</i>agaha were desirous of presenting to the Thera Bhikkhus a wishing-gift<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>, to wit, ghee and oil and dainty bits<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span>; while to the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka they used to give an ordinary gift according to their ability, to wit, scraps of food and sour gruel with it<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></a> When they had returned from their receipt of alms, and had eaten their meal, they asked the Thera Bhikkhus, 'What did you get, Sirs, at the place of alms; what did you get?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Some of the Theras answered, Sirs; 'We had ghee, we had oil, we had dainty bits.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka replied: 'We got nothing at all, Sirs; just an ordinary gift such as they could manage, scraps of food, and sour gruel with it.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.6">4.6</a> Now at that time a certain householder, possessed of good food<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span>, used to give a perpetual alms to the Saŋgha, a meal for four Bhikkhus. He with his wife and children used to stand at the place of alms and serve; and offer to some Bhikkhus boiled rice, and to some congey, and to some oil, and to some dainty bits.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the meal for the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka had been fixed for the morrow at the house of this prosperous householder. 'And the prosperous householder went to the &Acirc;rāma for some business or other, and went up to the place where the venerable Dabba the Mallian was. And when he had come there, he saluted the venerable Dabba the Mallian, and took his seat on one side. And him so seated did the venerable Dabba instruct, and arouse, and gladden, and incite with religious discourse.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the prosperous householder had thus been instructed, and aroused, and gladdened, and incited by the venerable Dabba the Mallian with <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> religious discourse, he said to the venerable Dabba the Mallian: 'For whom, Sir, has the meal been appointed to-morrow at our house?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'The meal has been appointed, my friend, at your house to-morrow for those Bhikkhus who are followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the prosperous householder was ill-pleased, thinking, 'How can bad Bhikkhus enjoy themselves at our house?' And going home he gave command to the slave-girl: 'For those who come to-morrow for the meal, spread out the mats in the entrance hall<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span>, and serve them with scraps of food, and with sour gruel with it!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Sir!' said the slave-girl, accepting the word of the householder.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.7">4.7</a> Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka spake one to another: 'Yesterday a meal has been appointed for us at the house of the prosperous householder. To-morrow he, with his wife and children, will attend upon us at the place of alms, and serve us. And he will offer to some of us boiled rice, and to some congey, and to some oil, and to some dainty bits. And through joy thereat they slept uneasily that night.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, having robed themselves in the early morning, went duly bowled and robed to the dwelling-place of the prosperous householder. And that slave-girl saw the Bhikkhus who were followers <a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka approaching from afar; and spreading out the mats in the entrance hall, she said to them, 'Be seated, Sirs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka thought: 'For a certainty the meal cannot yet be ready, since we are told to take our seats in the entrance.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the slave-girl coming up with scraps of food, and sour gruel with it, said to them, 'Eat, Sirs!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'We, sister, are of those for whom perpetual meals are provided.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I know, Sirs, that you are so. But only yesterday I received command from the householder that for them who should come to-morrow for the meal I was to spread out the mats in the entrance hall, and serve them with scraps of food, and some gruel with it. Eat, Sirs!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka thought: 'It was yesterday that the householder, the prosperous one, came to the &Acirc;rāma to visit Dabba the Mallian. For a certainty the householder must have been set against us by Dabba the Mallian.' And through sorrow thereat they ate uneasily. And the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, when they had finished their meal, returned from the receipt of alms, went to the &Acirc;rāma, and laid aside their bowls and their robes, and sat down outside the porch of the &Acirc;rāma, squatting against their waist cloths<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>, <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> silent, and ashamed, with fallen hearts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span>, and sunken faces, moody, and bewildered<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.8">4.8</a> Now the Bhikkhun&icirc; Mettiyā came up to the place where the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka were: and when she had come there she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span>!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When she had so said the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka did not speak to her. So a second time she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs!' and they did not speak. And a third time she said to them: 'My salutation to you, Sirs!' Still the third time the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka did not speak. And she said: 'Wherein have I offended you, Sirs? Wherefore do you not speak to me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Are you then so indifferent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span>, sister, when we are tormented by Dabba the Mallian?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what can I do, Sirs?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> 'If you like, sister, you could this very day make the Blessed One expel the venerable Dabba the Mallian.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But what shall I do, Sirs? What is it that it is in my power to do?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come now, sister; do you go to the place where the Blessed One is, and when you have come there say as follows: "This, Lord, is neither fit nor proper that the very quarter of the heavens which should be safe, secure, and free from danger, that from that very quarter should come danger, calamity, and distress--that where one might expect a calm, one should meet a gale. Methinks the very water has taken fire. I have been defiled, Lord, by Dabba the Mallian!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, Sirs!' said the Bhikkhun&icirc; Mettiyā, accepting the word of the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka. And she went to the Blessed One [and spake even as she had been directed].</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.9">4.9</a> Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Saŋgha, and asked the venerable Dabba the Mallian:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Are you conscious<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span>, Dabba, of having done such a thing as this Bhikkhun&icirc; says?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even as my Lord, the Blessed One, knows me.' [And a second and a third time the Blessed One asked the same question, and received the same reply.]</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> Then said the Blessed One: 'The Dabbas, O Dabba, do not thus repudiate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span>. If you have done it, say so. If you have not done it, say you have not.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Since I was born, Lord, I cannot call to mind<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> that I have practised sexual intercourse even in a dream, much less when I was awake!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Expel then, O Bhikkhus, the Bhikkhun&icirc; Mettiyā, and examine those Bhikkhus about it.' And so saying he rose from his seat and entered into the Vihāra.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Bhikkhus expelled the Bhikkhun&icirc; Mettiyā. But the Bhikkhus who were followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka said to those Bhikkhus: 'Do not, Sirs, expel the Bhikkhun&icirc; Mettiyā. She has not committed any offence. She has been set on by us with angry and bitter intentions of causing his fall.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'What then, Sirs? is it you who are thus harassing the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge and breach of morality?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is true, Sirs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant and annoyed and complained, saying, 'How can these Bhikkhus the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka harass the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge of breach of <a id="pg16"><span class="f2 g"><b>[16]</b></span></a> morality?' And they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is this true, O Bhikkhus?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he rebuked them, and when he had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">Let then the Saŋgha grant to Dabba the Mallian, whose conscience in respect of this matter is quite clear, the Proceeding for the consciously innocent<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.10">4.10</a> 'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is it to be granted.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let that Dabba the Mallian go before the Saŋgha, and having arranged his robe over one shoulder, let him bow down at the feet of the senior Bhikkhus; and crouching down<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span>, let him stretch <a id="pg17"><span class="f2 g"><b>[17]</b></span></a> forth his hands with the palms joined together, and let him say, "These Bhikkhus, Sirs, the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, are harassing me by a groundless charge of breach of morality. But I, Sirs, in respect thereof have a clear conscience, and I ask the Saŋgha for the acquittal to be accorded to those who are conscious of innocence." Then some able and discreet Bhikkhu is thus to lay the resolution (<i>ñ</i>atti) before the Saŋgha. "Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. These Bhikkhus, Sirs, the followers of Mettiya and Bhumma<i>g</i>aka, are harassing the venerable Dabba the Mallian with a groundless charge of a breach of morality, and the venerable Dabba the Mallian has in respect thereof a conscience that is clear, and asks the Saŋgha for the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. If the time is convenient to the Saŋgha, let the Saŋgha accord to the venerable Dabba the Mallian the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. This is the resolution. Let the venerable Saŋgha hear me. These Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) asks the Saŋgha for the acquittal of those who are conscious of innocence. The Saŋgha accords to the venerable Dabba the Mallian the acquittal of those who are consciously innocent.

					<p class="f4">'Among these, what is a legal question arising out of dispute? This, O Bhikkhus, is when Bhikkhus dispute, saying, "This is Dhamma," or "This is not Dhamma," or "This is Vinaya," or "This is not Vinaya," or "This is taught and spoken by the Tathāgata," or "This is not taught nor spoken by the Tathāgata," or "This has been practised by the Tathāgata," or "This has not been practised by the Tathāgata," or "This has been ordained by the Tathāgata," or "This has not been ordained by the Tathāgata," or "This is an offence," or "This is not an offence," or "This is a slight offence," or "This is a grievous offence," or "This is an offence which can be done away," or "This is an offence which cannot be done away<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn69" href="#n69">69</a>]</sup></span>," or "This is a most grave offence," or "This is not a most grave <a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> offence." Whatsoever quarrel, strife, controversy, difference of opinion, contradiction, opposition, cantankerousness<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn70" href="#n70">70</a>]</sup></span>, or contention there may be on such a matter, this is called a legal question arising out of dispute.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And among these, which is a legal question arising out of censure? This, O Bhikkhu, is when Bhikkhus charge a Bhikkhu with a fault of morality, or of conduct, or of opinion, or of means of livelihood. Whatsoever charge, censure, incrimination<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn71" href="#n71">71</a>]</sup></span>, admonition<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n71">71</a>]</sup></span>, candid opinion<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn72" href="#n72">72</a>]</sup></span>, making of excuses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span> for a person, or making fun of him, there may be, that is called a legal question arising out of censure.</p>

The five groups of offences<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> are subjects of legal questions of offences, and the seven groups of offences<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span> are subjects of legal questions of offence. This is what is called a legal question arising out of offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And among these, what is a legal question of business? Whatsoever is to the Saŋgha a matter which ought to be done, an obligation, a matter for which leave ought to be formally asked, the proposal <a id="pg37"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></a> of a resolution<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span>, the proceeding by is a <i>ñ</i>atti-dutiya-kamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span>, or by <i>ñ</i>atti-<i>k</i>atuttha-kamma<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span>, that is called a legal question of business.</p>

And there are three causes of wrong-doing that give rise to legal questions of dispute, and three causes of right-doing that give rise to legal questions of dispute. And which are these six?</p>

					<p class="f4">'In the first place, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu who is angry, and who bears enmity in his heart. Whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is such an angry man bearing enmity in his heart, he remains without reverence for, and without delight in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha, and does not fulfil all the duties of a disciple. And whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, remains without reverence for, and without delight in the Teacher, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha, and does not fulfil all the duties of a disciple, he causes disputes to arise in the Saŋgha, and such a dispute becomes a cause <a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> of woe, and of want, and of disaster to the great multitudes, of woe and of want to gods and men. If you, therefore, O Bhikkhus, perceive such a one, a root of disputes both internal and external, do you exert yourselves, O Bhikkhus, to put away from you so evil a person, the root of those disputes. If you perceive, O Bhikkhus, no such person, take pains lest any such evil root of disputes should thereafter arise among you. Thus will so evil a root of disputes be put away from you, and thus will no such evil person, the root of. disputes, arise hereafter among you.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Again, O Bhikkhus, there is the Bhikkhu, who is a hypocrite<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span>, and who hides his faults; who is envious and jealous; who is crafty and treacherous; who has sinful desires and false beliefs; who is tarnished by love of worldly gain, devoted to getting and taking, for whom to renounce a thing is hard. Whatsoever Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, is thus a hypocrite, who hides his faults, he remains [&amp;c., as before, the whole of the last paragraph down to the end being repeated in each of the cases here enumerated].</p>

So those Bhikkhus went to that residence, and spake to those Theras thus: 'This legal question, Sirs, has arisen in such and such a manner, and has grown up in such and such a manner. It would be well if the venerable Theras would settle the case according to the Dhamma, and according to the Vinaya, and according to the teaching of the Master!'

					<p class="f4">'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the secret method of taking votes? The Bhikkhu who is the teller of the votes is to make the voting tickets of different colours, and as each Bhikkhu comes up to him he is to say to him thus: "This is the ticket for the man of such an opinion; this the ticket for the man of such an opinion. Take whichever you like." When he has chosen (he is to add), "Don't show it to anybody." If he ascertains that those whose opinion is against the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to reject the vote as wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to report the vote as well taken. This, O Bhikkhus, is the secret method of taking the votes.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And how, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking votes? The Bhikkhu who is the teller of the votes is to whisper in each Bhikkhu's ear, "This is the ticket of those of such an opinion; this is the ticket of those of such an opinion. Take whichever <a id="pg57"><span class="f2 g"><b>[57]</b></span></a> you like." When he has chosen (he is to add), "Don't tell anybody (which way you have voted)." If he ascertains that those whose opinion is against the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to reject the vote as wrongly taken. If he ascertains that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, he is to report the vote as well taken. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the whispering method of taking the votes.</p>

					<p class="f4">And how, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking votes? If he ascertains (beforehand) that those whose opinion is in accordance with the Dhamma are in the majority, the vote is to be taken undisguisedly, openly. Thus, O Bhikkhus, is the open method of taking the votes.</p>

					<p class="f4">'These, O Bhikkhus, are the three methods of taking the votes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn114" href="#n114">114</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

And he replies thus: "Seeing that I am willing, Sir, though you did not ask me, to confess myself guilty of that trifling offence, why should I not confess, when asked, such and such a grievous offence--a Pārā<i>g</i>ika offence, or an offence equivalent to a Pārā<i>g</i>ika offence?" And the other rejoins, "But you do not confess, Sir, even that trifling offence without being asked. How should you confess, if you were not asked, the commission of such and such a grievous offence--a Pārā<i>g</i>ika offence, or one equivalent to a Pārā<i>g</i>ika offence?

The rule of procedure, called Sammukhā-vinaya, hereafter rendered 'Proceeding in Presence,' is one of the seven modes of settling disputes already. referred to in the closing chapter of the Pātimokkha ('Vinaya Texts,' vol. 1, p. 68), and is more fully described below in <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 14, 16, and following sections.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">It will be seen below, from §§ IV, 14, 27-30, that it is involved in, or rather is supposed to accompany, each of the other Proceedings mentioned in this chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The whole of the following story of Dabba down to the end of section 9 (except the last sentence) recurs in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga as the Introductory Story to the Eighth Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa. The Samanta Pāsādikā has therefore no commentary upon it here, and the few extracts that we give from it are taken from the notes of that work on the corresponding passage in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga. The stupidity of Udāyi, who once supplanted Dabba the Mallian in the performance of his duty as bhattuddesaka, forms the burthen of the Introductory Story to the <i>G</i>ātaka on 'the Measure of Rice' (No. 5 in the <i>G</i>ātaka book; 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' pp. 172 and following).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> On this phrase compare Mahāvagga V, 1, 21, and the verses at V, 1, 27.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> <i>Gh</i>āyino possibly used with the technical connotation of, being addicted to the practice of the Four <i>Gh</i>āna meditations; but compare Mahāvagga I, 1, 3, 5, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> See the comment as quoted by H.O.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Compare the use of te<i>g</i>odhātu<i>m</i> samāpa<i>g</i><i>g</i>itvā at Mahāvagga I, 15, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Compare api ssu at <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 9, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> That paribho<i>g</i>aniya<i>m</i> does not mean drinking-water, as Childers renders it, is clear from VIII, 1, 2, where it is implied that it is to be used for washing feet. Our translation of Mahāvagga II, 20, 5 should be corrected accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Compare below, VIII, 6, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Katika-sa<i>n</i><i>th</i>āna<i>m</i>. Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 81, and Mahāvagga VIII, 32, and <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> That this is the correct rendering of this otherwise doubtful passage is clear from the closing words of VIII, 1, 2, where most of these phrases recur. In the text, for the last word nikkhipitabba<i>m</i> read nikkhamitabba<i>m</i>, as pointed out in the note at p. 363 of the edition of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> These were two of the six leaders of the notorious <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Compare the 22nd Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Abhisa<i>m</i>khārika<i>m</i>; that is, a gift by the giving of which the donor expressly wished that a particular result (as, for stance, that the donor should be re-born as a king or queen, or should enter the paths, or have opportunity to hear a Buddha preach) should be brought about by the normal effect of that good act in a future birth. There are not a few instances of such wishes, and of their fulfilment, recorded in various parts of the sacred literature.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Uttaribha&#7749;gam. See the passages quoted in the note on Mahāvagga VI, 14, 3. These three things are also mentioned together at VIII, 4, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> These expressions recur at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 228. The Samanta Pāsādikā says merely <i>k</i>a<i>n</i>āgakan ti sakuntaka-bhatta<i>m</i>. Bila&#7749;gadutiyan ti <i>k</i>a<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ika-dutiya<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says simply kalyā<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> bhatta<i>m</i> assā ti kalyā<i>n</i>a-bhattiko.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>ake, which means the battlemented gateway which formed the entrance to an important house; and in which there was a room. See <i>G</i>ātaka I, 227.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i-pallatthikāya. There is a misprint in the text (&deg;ttikāya). On this curious expression, see below, V, 28, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Pattakkhandhā, which the Samanta Pāsādikā explains by patitakkhandhā. Khandhā here seems to mean 'faculties.' Compare the use of Dhammā in a similar connection at Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta II, 32 = Mahāvagga V, 13, 9; and see Buddhaghosa's commentary on that passage, quoted by Rh. D. in 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' p. 36.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Appa<i>t</i>ibhānā. Pa<i>t</i>ibhāna<i>m</i> is the rapid suggestion of an idea in a case of doubt or difficulty, an illumination; so that pa<i>t</i>ibhānako, the man of ready wit, may be compared with upāya-kusalo, the man fertile in resource. 'Absent-minded' would be an incorrect rendering; they had no idea what to think or do, and the appearance of the nun on the scene (in the next paragraph) supplied the want. Till then they hesitated, drifted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> The following narrative, down to § 9, is repeated almost word for word in V, 20, only that the person there persuaded to bring the false accusation is different.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> A<i>g</i><i>gh</i>upekkhati. Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 147.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Literally, 'Do you recollect?' But it is quite clear from the technical words at the close of this section that the verb sarati had already acquired the secondary meaning 'to be conscious of.' The whole story is peculiarly valuable as illustrating the growth of the connotation of the verb and its allied meanings, and indirectly the origin and growth of the idea of 'conscience' which has played so great a part in theological and ethical speculation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> That is, 'Men of character and standing such as yours, O Dabba, are not in the habit of repudiating a charge in so indirect a manner by adverting merely to their standing and known character.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> Here the word used is abhi<i>g</i>ānāmi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Dabbassa sati-vepulla-ppattassa sati-vinaya<i>m</i> detu. The explanation of the compound sati-vepulla-ppatto given by Childers, though it rests on so good an authority as that of Vi<i>g</i>esi<i>m</i>ha Mudaliar, cannot be right. He makes it mean 'a man of great intellectual development.' But sati must here refer to the fact that Dabba has been formally called upon to remember (sar&icirc;to) whether he did or did not commit the offence. And though the exact sense of the compound is subject to some doubt, the general sense of the clause must be very much as we have conjecturally rendered it. On this formal appeal to the conscience, or memory (sati), of a Bhikkhu charged with an offence, or supposed to have offended, see <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 2, and 5 at the end; and X, 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Ukku<i>t</i>ika<i>m</i> nis&icirc;ditvā. This verb does not mean 'to sit on the hams,' as rendered by Childers. The exact posture, unknown in Europe, is to crouch down on the feet (keeping both toes and heels on the ground) in such a way that the hams do not touch the ground, but come within an inch or two of it. Europeans find it very difficult to retain this posture for any length of time, but the natives of India find it easy, and it is regarded in the Pi<i>t</i>akas as a posture of humility.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> This section is repeated below, chap. 14, § 27, with the necessary alterations for a general rule instead of a particular case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The particular decision given in this chapter for the particular case is elaborated in chap. 14, § 28 below into a general rule for every similar case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains this word as follows: 'Bhāsitaparikantan ti vi<i>k</i>āya bhāsita<i>m</i> kāyena parikkanta<i>m</i> parikkametvā katan ti attho.' The similar word Parikanta<i>m</i>, which occurs in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, Pārā<i>g</i>ika IV, 1, 2, in the sense of lacerated, is from the root k<i>ri</i>nt.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Na<i>m</i> in the text is correct. It is identical with the <i>n</i>a<i>m</i> so frequently found in Jain Prakrit; on which see Weber in his Bhagavat&icirc; 'Abhandlungen der Berliner Akadamie,' 1865, pp. 422 and foll.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> Ummattakālaya<i>m</i> karoti, on which Buddhaghosa says nothing. The word recurs in the following section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> The mode in which such a confession ought to be made is set out in full in IV, 14, 30-34.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> The same, namely, as those in the list given at Mahāvagga IV, 16, 12, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> In other words, if a Bhikkhu confesses an offence different from that with which he has been charged, the confession cannot be used against him even as regards a decision with respect to the offence confessed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> On this chapter, see further below, IV, 14, 16.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> A<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ama<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> mukhaisatt&icirc;hi vitudantā viharanti. Literally, 'with mouth-javelins.' Vitudati, and not vit&ucirc;dati as Childers gives, is the right spelling. So Fausb&ouml;ll reads at <i>G</i>ātaka II, 185, 186.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> From here to the end of the chapter recurs in IV, 14, 24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> These are the qualifications always ascribed to one who rightly fills any judicial offence, and are called the four Agatis. They are the especial attributes of a good king sitting as judge, and are mentioned elsewhere (Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa XIII; Mahāvagga VIII, 5, 2; VIII, 6, 1; and below, VI, 11, 2) of other officials of the order with duties similar to those in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> On this chapter, see further below, IV, 14, 24-26.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> Oramattaka<i>m</i>. Compare the English law maxim, De minimis non curat lex.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Na <i>k</i>a gatigatan ti dve tayo āvāse na gata<i>m</i>, tattha tatth&#8217; eva vā dvitikkhattu<i>m</i> avini<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ita<i>m</i>. See on these proceedings above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Na <i>k</i>a sarita-sāritan ti dvitikkhattu<i>m</i> tehi bhikkh&ucirc;hi saya<i>m</i> sarita<i>m</i> va a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ehi sārita<i>m</i> vā na hoti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Gānāt&icirc; ti salāka<i>m</i> gāhento <i>g</i>ānāti. (S.P.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> App eva nāma. That this phrase does not merely mean 'perhaps' is clear from its use in § 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> Adhammena ga<i>n</i>hant&icirc; ti adhammavādino eva<i>m</i> maya<i>m</i> bah&ucirc; bhavissāmā ti dve&nbsp;dve salākāyo ga<i>n</i>hanti. (S.P.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> On vaggā, here = vi + agga, compare our note on the 21st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 2, 1. Buddhaghosa here says, Vaggā ga<i>n</i>hant&icirc; ti dve dhammavādino eka<i>m</i> dhammavādisalāka<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hanti eva<i>m</i> dhammavādino na bah&ucirc; bhavissanti ti ma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>amānā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> With this chapter the 26th section of chapter 14 should be compared, where very curious means are inculcated for avoiding some of the votes here stated to be invalid.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> In the Burmese MSS. the name of this monk is written Upavāla.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> A<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ena a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i>arati. We follow Wijesi<i>m</i>ha Mudaliyar's interpretation of this phrase as given by Childers (s.v. tassapāpiyyasikā).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> Chapter 14, section 29 below, is in fact an elaboration of this paragraph, giving instances of the kind of prevarication here intended to be referred to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> The exact meaning of the phrase is somewhat doubtful, owing to the ambiguity of the tassa. It should probably be analysed 'the proceeding against one who is more sinful (pāpiyo) than that (tassa);' that is, who adds sin to sin. Childers gives a long note on the Proceeding drawn by Wijesi<i>m</i>ha Mudaliyar from this chapter, but does not analyse the word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> This Kammavā<i>k</i>ā is precisely the same as is laid down in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 4, &amp;c. in the case of all the other penal Kammas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Compare the use of anuvādo in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> These paragraphs exactly correspond to paragraphs at <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 2. It is probably merely owing to this repetition that it is here also prescribed that the accused person must confess himself guilty, as it must be evident from the Introductory Story, that he will not do so.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> The whole of this chapter recurs below, IV, 14, 33.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa's commentary on this expression will be found in the notes to H.O.'s edition of the text, pp. 313, 314.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa (H.O. loc. cit.) explains this as meaning either Pārā<i>g</i>ika or Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa offences. So also he explains Du<i>t</i><i>th</i>ullā āpatti at Mahāvagga X, 5, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Deseyya<i>m</i>. Compare IV, 14, 33, at the end.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> On these phrases Buddhaghosa has the following note Di<i>t</i><i>th</i>āvikamman ti ye pana na me ta<i>m</i> khamat&icirc; ti a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ama<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>ā di<i>t</i><i>th</i>āvikamma<i>m</i> karonti tehi vā saddhi<i>m</i> āpatti<i>m</i> āpa<i>g</i><i>g</i>itvā pi, tattha anāgatā āgantvā vā <i>kh</i>anda<i>m</i> datvā parive<i>n</i>ādisu nisinnā, te āpatt&icirc;hi na vu<i>t</i><i>th</i>ahanti. This is more an exegesis on the rule than an explanation of the words Di<i>t</i><i>th</i>āvikamma<i>m</i> <i>th</i>apetvā, the exact meaning of which remains doubtful. The literal rendering would be 'except as regards the manifestation of opinion.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> It was with reference to this conduct of <i>Kh</i>anna that the Buddha is stated in the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 4 to have imposed a penalty upon him. He is also mentioned above, I, 25-31, and below, XI, 1, 12-14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Compare the 16th and 43rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas. Buddhaghosa says here, Bhikkhun&icirc;na<i>m</i> anupakha<i>g</i><i>g</i>ā ti bhikkhun&icirc;na<i>m</i> antopavisitvā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> The various ways of settling these four kinds of legal questions are recapitulated in § 27-34 of this chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> Sāvasesā-anavasesā-āpatti. The Parivara IX, 1, 10 says, Yā sā āpatti anavasesā sā āpatti na katamena adhikara<i>n</i>ena na katamamhi <i>th</i>āne na katamena samathena sammati. It is practically equivalent therefore to Pārā<i>g</i>ikā. Those offences which can be done away, but only by the Saŋgha, are called accordingly in the Buddhist Sanskrit Sa<i>m</i>ghāva<i>s</i>esha, which corresponds to the Pāli Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa. The translation and note at Mahāvagga X, 2, 4 should be altered accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Vipa<i>k</i><i>k</i>atāya vohāro ti <i>k</i>itta-dukkhatthāya vohāro pharusava<i>k</i>anan ti attho (S.P.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> That is to say, the five mentioned in the last note, and besides them, Thulla<i>k</i><i>k</i>aya and Dubbhāsita.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Apalokana-kamman ti-ādi pana tass&#8217; eva pabheda-va<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i>.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> See our note at Mahāvagga I, 28, 3. The Samanta Pāsādikā here says, <i>ñ</i>attidutiyakamma<i>m</i> pana apaloketvā kattabba<i>m</i> pi atthi akattabba<i>m</i> pi atthi.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> Palās&icirc;; no doubt connected with the primary meaning of the word 'leaf,' as is also its use in the sense of 'covering, lining,' in eka-palāsikā upāhanā at Mahāvagga V, 1, 29. The expression forms the subject of Puggala II, 2. See also <i>G</i>ātaka III, 259.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa has no explanation of these terms here, but on A&#7749;guttara Nikāya III, 2, 3, where the whole list recurs, he says (as Dr. Morris is good enough to inform us) that oko<i>t</i>imako is equal to laku<i>n</i><i>t</i>ako; and the same explanation is given by the commentary on Puggala IV, 19. Compare the use in English of 'a mere dot of a man,' in a similar sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> These three epithets of the voice are no doubt intended to be the opposites of the three in Mahāvagga V, 13.'9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> We have already pointed out (above, IV, 1, 2) that this mode of the commencement of a discussion by setting out a list of the points to be discussed and compared is found also in some of the Abhidhamma books. There it was only the objects themselves, here we have all the predicates which it is proposed to apply (as in § 8), or to declare inapplicable to the object (as in § 10), which are set out, but the principle is the same.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> This is merely a play upon words. &Acirc;patti is literally 'attainment to.' Standing alone it is always used with the connotation of 'attainment to guilt, sin, offence,' so that its etymological meaning is always lost sight of. Sotāpatti is the 'attainment to,' the 'entering upon' the stream, that is, the course of the Excellent Way. The Sam āpatti s, literally, 'complete, or higher, attainments,' are eight successive states of ecstatic insight or meditation practised by Arahats and other men of advanced spiritual culture. The question stated is in fact a riddle, like so many of the questions stated in the Parivāra and the Puggala-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Here again the whole section depends upon a play upon the various meanings of the word ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>am. In the technical phrase ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>ādhikarana<i>m</i>, the word means solely the business or the agenda at the formal meetings of the Saŋgha (compare above, § 7). In the problems or riddles of this section its more common meaning of 'duty' is brought into play.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> Sammukhā-vinayena. See above, chapter 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> Yebhuyyasikena. See above, chapter 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> The following five paragraphs recur in IV, 14, §§ 24, 27, and four of them in IV, 14, 21, 30.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Kammappattā. See Parivāra XIX, 1, 7, et seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> See above, Mahāvagga II, 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> Or rather, 'perhaps, 'against the proceedings which are being carried out.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> This is the 63rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> This is the 79th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. The whole paragraph is repeated several times below in this chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> Ettakena vā antarena, on which Buddhaghosa has nothing. On vā = eva, see B&ouml;htlingk-Roth s.v. vā, No. 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> These words recur at XII, 2, 7, where an instance occurs of the mode of proceeding here laid down.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Ubbāhikāya. Childers has quite misunderstood both the meaning and the derivation of this term. It must be derived from ud+vah; and means simply 'reference'--the turning over of a difficult or intricate case from the general Saŋgha to a special committee, as was done at Vesāl&icirc; (below, XII, 2, 7).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> With this passage (so far) compare the &Acirc;ka&#7749;kheyya Sutta, § 2 (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 210), where the wording is somewhat different. See, however, the various readings here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> We prefer to translate, in accordance with IX, 5, I below, sāttha<i>m</i> savya<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ana<i>m</i> as given in the corrections to the text on p. 303; thus making the phrase 'in the spirit and in the letter' refer to the brahma-<i>k</i>ariya<i>m</i>, and not to the dhammā. But it should be pointed out that the parallel passage in the stock description of a Buddha (for instance in Tevi<i>g</i><i>g</i>a Sutta I, 46, translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 187) would support the reading given here in the text, referring the phrase in question to the dhammā, and not to the brahma-<i>k</i>ariya<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> See the various readings, and compare Sigālovāda Sutta, p. 301; <i>G</i>ātaka II, 247, 293; Mahāvagga VI, 25, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> Though di<i>t</i><i>th</i>i is usually found in its bad sense of 'delusion' (it never means 'heresy,' as Childers renders it), it is also used, especially in older texts, in the good sense of 'insight.' Compare the 'Book of the Great Decease,' I, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> Perhaps this may mean 'both as to the Suttas themselves and as to the Old Commentary upon them'--suttato anuvya<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anaso. See 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. i, p. xviii, and note 2, p. xxix.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> Vinaye <i>kh</i>eko hoti asa<i>m</i>h&icirc;ro. Compare on the use of these words, <i>G</i>ātaka I, 290; II, 161; Sutta Nipāta V, 18, 26.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> On all these terms, which have occurred above at IV, 2, I, see the commentary as there quoted in the notes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> It is of course to be understood that the committee or jury does not consist of only one such Bhikkhu. In the instance already referred to as occurring in XII, 2, 7, four are chosen from each side.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Sammukhā-vinayena. See chapter 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> This is the same as in § 16 of this chapter, except that 'the presence of the Saŋgha' is omitted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> See the 63rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and § 17 above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> That is, the Pātimokkha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Literally, 'cause him to arise.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> This sentence is also used of the other modes of settlement below, §§ 27, 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> So also above, § 16; and below, §§ 27-29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> That is, the Four Nikāyas, now forming the Sutta Pi<i>t</i>aka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> See our note above on <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> On the following section, compare chapters 9 and to above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> On Sa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>attiyā see our note below on VII, 4, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> This naive chapter would seem to show that the pia fraus was not unknown to the Buddhist monks at the time when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was composed. Buddhaghosa's note (given at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text) specifies the different occasions when each of the three methods should be used.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> This clause corresponds to the one above, in §24, and below, in § 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> This section again bears exactly the same relation to chapter 11 as the previous ones have done to chapters 4 and 5 respectively. The outline of the form is the same, but as in the introductory part (containing the description of the offence) the present section is much fuller than the chapter to which it refers, 'we prefer to give that part of this section in full.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> &Acirc;yati<i>m</i> samvareyyāsi. So again in the next section. Compare V, 20, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> See §§ 16, 29, &amp;c. of this chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>iga<i>n</i>heyya<i>m</i>. See V, 20, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> This refers to the technical term of the Proceeding in question, ti<i>n</i>avatthārakena deseyya<i>m</i> (IV, 13, 2); and the singular of course includes the plural, as the confession usually took place before a number of Bhikkhus.</p>
