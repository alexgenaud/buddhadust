					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed Buddha was staying at Sāvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anāthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove. And at that time Bhikkhus who had been placed on probation<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> used to accept reverence and service and salutation and respect from regular Bhikkhus; and to allow them to provide a seat, or a sleeping-place, or water for the feet, or a foot-stool, or a foot-towel for them; and to carry their bowl or their robe, and to shampoo them<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg385"><span class="f2 g"><b>[385]</b></span></a> Those Bhikkhus who were moderate were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation accept reverence (&amp;c., as above, down to) shampoo them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And those Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha, and asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, as they say, that Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation accept reverence (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked them, saying, 'How can those Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them? This will not conduce, O Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as usual, down to)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had rebuked them, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, saying, 'A Bhikkhu who has been placed on probation ought not to accept reverence (&amp;c., as before, down to) shampoo them. Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, to those Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation to do [all the courtesies, duties, and services mentioned above<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>] for one another, according to their seniority. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, five things (as permissible) to Bhikkhus who have been placed on probation, <a id="pg386"><span class="f2 g"><b>[386]</b></span></a> according to their seniority; (that is to say), the Uposatha ceremony, the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā ceremony, the share in robes for the rainy season, in things dedicated to the Saṅgha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>, and in food.</p>

A Bhikkhu who has been placed under probation ought not, O Bhikkhus, to visit the families who support a regular Bhikkhu (by officiating, in order to do so, as the companion who precedes or follows that regular Bhikkhu)--he ought riot to devote himself to a forest life--he ought not to devote himself to living on alms personally received<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>--he ought not to cause an alms to be brought out to him with the object of escaping an extension of his probationary term<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>, thinking, "Let them not recognise me" (as one who has been placed under probation)<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> There are four principal kinds of probation; the first of which was required when the follower of another of the reforming sects was received into the Buddhist Order, and is described in Mahāvagga I, 38. The other three, which follow on the commission of a Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa offence, are more particularly described below in the third Khandhaka. The Pāli names of these four are respectively apa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>anna-parivāsa, pa<i>t</i>i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>anna-parivāsa, suddhanta-parivāsa, and samodhāna-parivāsa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">No conclusion should be drawn against this statement from the passage above at I, 9, 1; though Seyyasaka's conduct, as there described, would not have rendered him liable to any one of these four principal probationary proceedings. For he is said to have been guilty of many offences (āpatti-bahulo). The accompanying enumeration must be taken, not as a description of those offences, but as additional to them. And the probation imposed upon him must have been for concealing one or more of the many offences not particularly specified.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> All these expressions recur above, I, 27, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> See I, 1, 2, down to the end.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> That is, in the lists recurring in the previous paragraphs, and given in full at I, 27, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Ono<i>g</i>anam, which the Samanta Pāsādikā explains by 'visa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ana<i>m</i>: Compare the use of ono<i>g</i>esi at D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa XIII, 29. The etymology of the word is unknown to us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā has here the following note on sava<i>k</i>aniya<i>m,</i> which should be compared with the shorter note on the same word given above, I, it, 5: Na sava<i>k</i>aniya<i>m</i> kātabban ti palibodhatthāya pakkosanatthāya vā sava<i>k</i>aniya<i>m</i> na kātabba<i>m</i>.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says here, &Acirc;sanapariyanto bhattaggād&icirc;su sa<i>m</i>gha-navak-āsana<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati, svassa dātabbo. Pariyanta is used here in the same sense as in the 22nd Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Vihārā, In later times this word is no doubt always, or almost always, used to designate the whole of a building in which several or many Bhikkhus resided. In the older literature it always, or almost always, denotes the dwelling-place, the private apartment, of a single Bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> That is, to refrain from salāka-bhatta, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, Tappa<i>k</i><i>k</i>ayā &#8217;ti niha<i>t</i>abhatto hutvā vihāren&#8217; eva nisiditvā bhu<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anto vattiyo ga<i>n</i>ayissāmi ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ato me bhikkh&ucirc; disvā anāro<i>k</i>entassa ratti<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edo (cap. 2) siyā &#8217;ti iminā kāra<i>n</i>ena pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>apāto na niharāpetabbo.</p>

Anāvāso nāma <i>k</i>etiyaghara<i>m</i> bodhighara<i>m</i> samma<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>ania<i>t</i><i>t</i>ako dārua<i>t</i><i>t</i>ako pāniyamā<i>l</i>o va<i>k</i><i>k</i>aku<i>t</i>i dvārako<i>t</i><i>th</i>ako &#8217;ti evamādi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> In the text read āvāso vā anāvāso vā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> This recurs in Khandhaka I, chapter 27.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Compare the 69th Sekhiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Compare the 68th Sekhiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> A narrow space of open ground, levelled and cleared of jungle, for the purpose of being used to walk up and down upon when meditating. See our note on Mahayana V, 1, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> On these disciplines and on rehabilitation, see the following Khandhaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Compare Mahāvagga IX, 4, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Literally, 'breaking of the nights.' The time of probation was reckoned, not by days, but by nights; and in either of the three cases which follow the reckoning was interrupted, and had to begin afresh.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains this to mean when the probationer has done any of the things forbidden in II, 1, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> That is, when the probationer has done any of the things forbidden in II, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> That is, when the probationer has omitted to make any of the announcements prescribed at the end of II, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> This chapter is repeated below, chap. 8, in reference to Bhikkhus undergoing the Mānatta discipline.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> That is, if it should be impossible during the time immediately succeeding the imposition of probation to fulfil all the thereto necessary duties, then a Bhikkhu might postpone the fulfilment to some more convenient season.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā here says, Eva<i>m</i> vatta<i>m</i> samādiyitvā parivutta-parivāsassa mānatta<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hato puna vatta-samādāna-ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>am n&#8217; atthi samādinna-vatto yeva hi esa. Tasmāssa <i>kh</i>āratta<i>m</i> mānatta<i>m</i> dātabba<i>m,</i> <i>k</i>inna-mānatto abbhetabbo, eva<i>m</i> anāpattiko hutvā suddhante pati<i>t</i><i>th</i>ito tisso sikkhā p&ucirc;retvā dukkhass&#8217; anta<i>m</i> karissat&icirc;ti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> This is fully explained in the next Khandhaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> In the text alter the words 'Instead of sa<i>m</i>ghena parivāso dinno hoti read sa<i>m</i>ghena m&ucirc;lāya pa<i>t</i>ikassanāraho kato hoti' into 'Instead of parivāsikā bhikkh&ucirc; read m&ucirc;lāya pa<i>t</i>ikassanārahā bhikkh&ucirc;.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> This is fully explained in the next Khandhaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> It will be seen, therefore, that there is very little, one might almost say no practical, difference between the Parivāsa, which we have rendered 'probation,' and the Mānatta, which we have usually left untranslated, and sometimes rendered 'penance.' Neither the one nor the other are at present enforced anywhere among the Buddhists.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> See chapter 2, note 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> See the notes above on chapter 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The Samanta Pāsādikā says, &ucirc;ne ga<i>n</i>e ti <i>k</i>attāro vā atirekā vā.</p>
