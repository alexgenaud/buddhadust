					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthi, in Anātha Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's &Acirc;rāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time incoming Bhikkhus entered the &Acirc;rāma with their sandals on<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, or with sunshades held up over them<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, or with their heads muffled up<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, or with their upper robe carried in a bundle on their heads<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>; and they washed their feet in the drinking-water; and they did not salute resident Bhikkhus senior to them, nor ask them where they (the incomers) should sleep.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain incoming Bhikkhu undid the bolt<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> of an unoccupied room (Vihāra), and opened the door<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>, and so entered by force; and a snake fell <a id="pg273"><span class="f2 g"><b>[273]</b></span></a> on to his back from the lintel above<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>, and he was terrified, and made an outcry<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus, running up, asked him why he did so. He told them that matter. Then those Bhikkhus who were moderate in their desires were vexed and indignant, and murmured, saying, 'How can incoming Bhikkhus enter the &Acirc;rāma . . . .? (&amp;c., as before, down to) . . . . where they should sleep<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told the matter to the Blessed One (&amp;c., as usual, I, 1, 2, 3, down to) he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said, 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for incoming Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'An incoming Bhikkhu, O Bhikkhus, when he knows he is about to enter an &Acirc;rāma, ought to take off his sandals, turn them upside down<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>, beat them (to get the dust) off, take them (up again) in his <a id="pg274"><span class="f2 g"><b>[274]</b></span></a> hand, put down his sunshade, uncover his head, arrange his upper robe on his back<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>, and then carefully and slowly enter the &Acirc;rāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When he enters the &Acirc;rāma he ought to notice where the resident Bhikkhus are gone to; and whithersoever they are gone--whether to the service hall, or to the portico (ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>apa), or to the foot of a tree--thither he ought to go, and laying his bowl on one side, and his robe on one side, he ought to take a suitable seat, and sit down.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He ought to ask as to the drinking-water, and the water for washing<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>, which is appropriated to the one use, and which to the other. If he has need of drinking-water, he ought to fetch it and drink. If he has need of water for washing, he ought to fetch it, and wash his feet. In washing his feet he ought to pour the water over them with one hand, and wash them with the other; he ought not to pour the water over them and wash them with one and the same hand.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He ought to ask for the cloths with which sandals are cleaned, and clean his sandals. In cleaning his sandals he ought first to wipe them with a dry cloth, and afterwards with a wet cloth: and then he ought to wash the cloths, and lay them on one side<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg275"><span class="f2 g"><b>[275]</b></span></a> 'If the resident Bhikkhu be senior, he ought to be saluted; if junior, he ought to be made to salute (the incomer). The incomer ought to ask as to the lodging-place, which has fallen (to his lot)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>, and whether it is occupied or unoccupied. He ought to ask as to lawful and unlawful resorts<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>, and as to what families have been officially declared to be in want<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>'He ought to ask as to the retiring-places, (where they are), and as to the drinking-water, and as to the water for washing, and as to the staves for walking with, and as to the place for the conferences of the Saŋgha, (and as to) the time at which he ought to enter (it) and at which he ought to leave it.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'If the Vihāra be unoccupied, he ought to knock at the door, then to wait a minute, then to undo the bolt, and open the door, and then, still standing outside, to look within.</p>

					<p class="f4">'If that Vihāra is covered with dust<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>, or the beds or chairs are piled one upon another, and the bedding put in a heap on the top of them<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span>,--then if <a id="pg276"><span class="f2 g"><b>[276]</b></span></a> he can do so he ought to clean up the Vihāra.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span> And when cleaning the Vihāra, he ought to take the floor matting out and put it down on one side, and the supports of the bedsteads<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span>, and the bolsters<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span> and pillows, and the mat which is used as a seat. Putting the bedsteads and chairs down on to the ground, and carefully avoiding scratching (the floor with them) or knocking them up against (the door-posts), he ought to take them outside the door, and put them down on one side. The spittoon and the board to lean up against<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span> ought to be taken out, and put down on one side<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn24" href="#n24">24</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">'If the Vihāra is covered with cobwebs, they should first be removed with a cloth<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn25" href="#n25">25</a>]</sup></span>. The casements should be dusted, especially in the corners and joints.</p>

					<p class="f4">'If the wall which had been plastered and red-washed, or the floor which had been laid (with earth) and black-washed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn26" href="#n26">26</a>]</sup></span>, has become dirty in the corners<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn27" href="#n27">27</a>]</sup></span>, they should be wiped down with a <a id="pg277"><span class="f2 g"><b>[277]</b></span></a> duster<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn28" href="#n28">28</a>]</sup></span> that has been first wetted and wrung out. If the floor has not been so prepared, it should be sprinkled over with water and swept<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn29" href="#n29">29</a>]</sup></span>, lest the Vihāra should be spoilt<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span> by dust. The sweepings should be gathered together, and cast aside.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg278"><span class="f2 g"><b>[278]</b></span></a> 4. 'The floor coverings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span> should be dried in the sun, cleaned, beaten to get the dust out, taken back, and spread out again in the place to which they belonged<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span>. The supports of the bed should be dried in the sun, dusted, taken back, and put in the place to which they belonged. The bed (ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a) and the chairs (p&icirc;<i>th</i>a) should be aired in the sun, cleaned, beaten to get the dust out, turned upside down, taken back, carefully avoiding scratching them against the floor, or knocking them up against the door-posts, and then put in the place to which they belonged<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn33" href="#n33">33</a>]</sup></span>. The bolsters and pillows, and the <a id="pg279"><span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span></a> mats used as seats, should be aired in the sun, cleaned; beaten to get the dust out, <i>t</i>aken back, and put in the place to which they belonged. The spittoon, and the board for leaning up against, should be put in the sun, dusted, taken back, and put in the place to which they belonged.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn34" href="#n34">34</a>]</sup></span>5. '(Then the incoming Bhikkhu) should put away his bowl and his robe. In putting away his bowl, he should hold it in one hand while he feels under the bed or the chair with the other, and then put it away; and he should not put it on a part of the floor which has been left bare. In putting away his robe, he should hold it in one hand while he feels along the bamboo or the rope used for hanging robes on with the other; and then hang it up with the border turned away from him, and the fold turned towards him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn35" href="#n35">35</a>]</sup></span> 'If the winds, bearing dust with them<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn36" href="#n36">36</a>]</sup></span>, blow from the East, West, North, or South, the window spaces<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn37" href="#n37">37</a>]</sup></span> on the side in question should be closed up (with shutters or lattices). If it is cold weather, the lattices should be opened by day, and closed by <a id="pg280"><span class="f2 g"><b>[280]</b></span></a> night: if it is hot weather, they should be closed by day, and opened by night.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span>'If the cell, or the store-room, or the refectory, or the room where the fire is kept, or the privy, is covered with dust, it should be swept out. If there is no drinking-water, or water for washing, they should be provided. If there is no water in the rinsing-pot<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span>, water should be poured into it.</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct for incoming Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> Now at that time resident Bhikkhus, on seeing incoming Bhikkhus, did not prepare seats for them, nor provide water and footstools and towels for them to wash their feet, nor go to meet them and take charge of their bowls and their robes, nor ask them whether they wanted drinking-water<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span>, nor salute such of the incoming Bhikkhus as were their seniors, nor make beds ready for them.</p>

					<p class="f4">The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c., and told the matter to the Blessed One, &amp;c., (down to) he said to the Bhikkhus: 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, <a id="pg281"><span class="f2 g"><b>[281]</b></span></a> do I establish a rule of conduct for resident Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'A resident Bhikkhu, on seeing an incoming Bhikkhu, who is senior to him, ought to make ready a seat for him, provide water and a footstool and a towel for him to wash his feet; go to meet him, and take charge of his robe and his bowl, ask him if he wants water to drink, and if he can (bring himself to do so), he ought to wipe his sandals. In wiping the sandals, they should be first wiped with a dry cloth, then with a wet one, and the cloths ought then to be washed, and put aside.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn41" href="#n41">41</a>]</sup></span> 'An incoming Bhikkhu ought to be saluted. A bed should be laid for him, saying, "This bed is for you." He should be informed whether (the bed-room) is occupied or not, what are lawful and what are unlawful resorts, and what families have been officially declared to be in want. He should be told where the retiring-places are, and the drinking and washing water, and the staves, and the place for the conferences of the Saŋgha, and what is the time when he ought to enter, and ought to leave (it).</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'If (the incoming Bhikkhu) be junior to him, then (the resident Bhikkhu), keeping his seat, should tell him where he is to put his bowl and his robe away, and on which mat he is to sit down. The incoming Bhikkhu should be informed where the drinking and washing water are, and the cloths to clean sandals with; he should be allowed to salute the resident Bhikkhu: and he should be told <a id="pg282"><span class="f2 g"><b>[282]</b></span></a> where his bed is, saying, "That bed is for you." He should be informed whether (that bedroom) is occupied or not (and so on, as in last paragraph, down to the end).</p>

					<p class="f4">'This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct for resident Bhikkhus, according to which they ought to behave.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3.1">3.1</a> Now at that time Bhikkhus, about to leave, started without setting the wooden articles and crockery in order, leaving doors and lattices open, and without giving the sleeping-places in charge to any one. The wooden articles and crockery were spoilt, and the sleeping-places were unprotected.</p>

					<p class="f4">The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. . . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c . . . . (down to) He. said to the Bhikkhus: 'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for Bhikkhus about to leave, according to which they ought to behave.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. 'A Bhikkhu about to leave should, O Bhikkhus, put the wooden articles and earthenware in order, close the doorways and lattices, give the sleeping-places in charge<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span> (to some one, and only) then set out. If there be no Bhikkhu remaining, a Sāma<i>n</i>era should be put in charge. If there be no Sāma<i>n</i>era remaining, the attendant who keeps the grounds in order<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span> should be put in charge. If <a id="pg283"><span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span></a> there be neither Bhikkhu, nor Sāma<i>n</i>era, nor &Acirc;rāmika, the bed frame should be laid on four stones<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span>, the other bed frames put on the top of it, the chairs should be put one on the top of the other, the bedding piled in a bundle on the top, the wooden articles and the earthenware should be put away in order, and the doorways and lattices should be closed<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn45" href="#n45">45</a>]</sup></span>, and then should be set out.</p>

					<p class="f4">3. 'If the Vihāra leaks, it should be repaired if he can, or he should exert himself to get the Vihāra roofed. If he should thus succeed, it is good. If not, he should put the bed frame on four stones in that part of the Vihāra which does not leak, and then put the other bed frame (&amp;c., as in last paragraph, to the end). If the whole of the Vihāra leaks, he should if he can take all the bedding to the village, or should exert himself to get it taken there. If he should succeed, it is good. If not, he should lay a bed frame on four stones in the open air, put the others on the top of it, put the chairs one on another, pile the bedding on the top, lay the wooden and earthenware utensils in order by them, and cover the whole up with grass or leaves, so that at least the principal articles of furniture might remain (uninjured)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn46" href="#n46">46</a>]</sup></span>; and (only) then go away.</p>

					<p class="f4">This, O Bhikkhus, is the rule of conduct for <a id="pg284"><span class="f2 g"><b>[284]</b></span></a> Bhikkhus about to leave, according to which they should behave themselves.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p4">4.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4.1">4.1</a> Now at that time the Bhikkhus did not give thanks in the place where a meal was served. People murmured, &amp;c.; the Bhikkhus heard, &amp;c.; the Blessed One on that occasion, &amp;c.<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn47" href="#n47">47</a>]</sup></span> said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the giving of thanks.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhus thought, 'By whom should the thanks be given?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, the elder Bhikkhu (present) to give thanks in the place where a meal is served.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time (the turn to provide) the Saŋgha with a meal had fallen to a certain company<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn48" href="#n48">48</a>]</sup></span>; and the venerable Sāriputta was the senior (Bhikkhu in that) Saŋgha. The Bhikkhus, thinking, 'The Blessed One has permitted the senior Bhikkhu to return thanks in the place where a meal is served,' went away, leaving the venerable Sāriputta alone. And the venerable Sāriputta gave thanks to those people, and then came away alone.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One saw the venerable Sāriputta coming from the distance; and on seeing him, he said to him: 'Did the meal, then, Sāriputta, pass off well<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn49" href="#n49">49</a>]</sup></span>?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg285"><span class="f2 g"><b>[285]</b></span></a> 'The meal, Lord, passed off well. But the Bhikkhus went away and left me alone.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, in that connection, having delivered a religious discourse, said to them:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow, O Bhikkhus, four or five of the Bhikkhus, who are senior or next to the seniors, to wait.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a certain elder waited in the dining hall, though he wanted to retire, and through holding himself back, he fainted and fell.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, if necessity should arise, to leave the hall after informing the Bhikkhu sitting immediately next<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn50" href="#n50">50</a>]</sup></span> (to the one who wants to go).'</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus went to the place where a meal was to be served with their under-garments or their robes improperly put on, and not decently attired; and turning aside<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn51" href="#n51">51</a>]</sup></span>, they pushed on in front of the senior Bhikkhus; and they encroached on (the space intended for) the senior Bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn52" href="#n52">52</a>]</sup></span> when taking their seats, and they compelled the junior Bhikkhus to give up their seats to them; and spreading out their upper robes <a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a> (as mats)<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn53" href="#n53">53</a>]</sup></span> they took their seats in the space between the houses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn54" href="#n54">54</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">The moderate Bhikkhus murmured, &amp;c. . . . told the Blessed One, &amp;c. . . . he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Therefore, O Bhikkhus, do I establish a rule of conduct for the Bhikkhus at a meal, which they are to observe thereat.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn55" href="#n55">55</a>]</sup></span>3. 'When time has been called in the &Acirc;rāma, a Bhikkhu should put on his waistcloth so as to cover himself all round from above the navel to below the knees, tie his belt round his waist, fold<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn56" href="#n56">56</a>]</sup></span> his upper robes and put them on, fasten the block on<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn57" href="#n57">57</a>]</sup></span>, wash (his hands), take his alms-bowl, and then slowly and carefully proceed to the village. He is not to turn aside (from the direct route) and push on in front of senior Bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn58" href="#n58">58</a>]</sup></span>. He is to go amidst the houses properly clad, with (his limbs) under control, with downcast eye, with (his robes) not tucked up, not laughing, or speaking loudly, not swaying his body or his arms or his head about, not with his arms akimbo, or his robe pulled over his head, and without walking on his heels. And he is to take his <a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> seat amidst the houses properly clad (&amp;c., all as before, down to) not with his arms akimbo, or his robes pulled over his head, and without lolling, and without encroaching on (the space intended for) the senior Bhikkhus, or ejecting the junior Bhikkhus from the seats, or spreading his upper robe out (as a mat).</p>

					<p class="f4">4. 'When the water is being given out (before the meal), he is to hold his bowl with both hands, receive the water (in it), lower the bowl carefully down to the ground so as to avoid scratching the floor, and then wash it. If there be (a person there) whose duty it is to take away the water (which has been so used), (the Bhikkhu) should lower (his bowl on to the ground) and pour the water into the waste tub<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn59" href="#n59">59</a>]</sup></span> without splashing the person in question, nor the Bhikkhus near, nor (his own) robes. If there be no such person, he should lower his bowl on to the earth and pour the water away, without splashing the Bhikkhus near or (his own) robes.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When the boiled rice is being given out, he should hold his bowl with both hands, and receive the rice in it. Room should be left for the curry. If there is ghee, or oil, or delicacies<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn60" href="#n60">60</a>]</sup></span>, the senior Bhikkhu should say: "Get an equal quantity for all." The alms (given) are to be accepted with mind alert, paying attention to the bowl, with equal curry, and equally heaped up<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn61" href="#n61">61</a>]</sup></span>. And the senior <a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> Bhikkhu is not to begin to eat until the boiled rice has been served out to all.</p>

					<p class="f4"><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn62" href="#n62">62</a>]</sup></span>5. 'The alms given are to be eaten with mind alert, paying attention to the bowl, with equal curry, and equally heaped up; without pressing down from the top; without covering up the curry or the condiment with the rice, desiring to make it nicer; and without asking for either rice or curry for the Bhikkhu's own particular use, unless he be sick. Others' bowls are not to be looked at with envious thoughts. The food is not to be rolled up (by the fingers) into balls that are too large, but into round mouthfuls. The door of the mouth is not to be opened till the ball is brought close to it. When eating, the whole hand is not to be put into the mouth. He is not to talk with his mouth full, nor to toss the food into his mouth as he eats, nor to nibble at the balls of food, nor to stuff his cheeks out as he eats, nor to shake (particles of food off) his hands, nor to scatter lumps of rice about, nor to put out his tongue, nor to smack his lips, nor to make a hissing sound as he eats, nor to lick his fingers, or his bowl, or his lips. And the jar containing drinking-water is not to be taken hold of with hands soiled with food.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5.1">5.1</a> Now at that time Bhikkhus who were going on their rounds for alms did so with their under garments or their robes improperly put on, and not decently attired, and they entered dwellings without deliberation, and left them without deliberation, and they entered dwellings roughly, and left them roughly, and they stood at too great a distance or too near, and they stood too long or turned back too soon.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a certain Bhikkhu, on his round for alms, entered a dwelling without noticing where he was going to, and taking (a doorway) for a house-door he passed into an inner chamber. A woman was lying asleep naked on her back in that chamber; and when the Bhikkhu saw her he went out again, perceiving that that was no house-door, but a chamber. Now the husband of that woman, seeing his wife in that position in the chamber, thought: 'My wife has been defiled by that Bhikkhu.' And he seized him, and beat him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> But the woman, being woke up by the noise, said to the man, 'Why, Sir, are you beating this Bhikkhu?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'You have been defiled by this Bhikkhu.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not so, Sir. This Bhikkhu has done nothing' (said she), and had the Bhikkhu set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Bhikkhu, on going to the &Acirc;rāma, told the matter to the Bhikkhus . . . murmured . . . . told the Blessed One . . . . he said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

He should not go in, nor come out, roughly. He should not stand too far off, nor too near, nor too long; and he should not turn back too easily.</p>

					<p class="f4">'As he stands still he should notice where (the people in the house) seem willing or not willing to give (him food). If she lays aside her work, or rises from her seat, or wipes a spoon, or wipes or puts ready a dish, he should stand still, perceiving that she seems willing to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He should take notice whether she seems willing or not to give curry. If she wipes a spoon, or wipes or puts aside a dish, he should stand still, perceiving that she seems willing to give.</p>

					<p class="f4">'After the food has been given, he should cover up the bowl with his robe, and turn back slowly and carefully. He should pass through the houses (on his way back) properly clad . . . . (&amp;c., as in § 3, sentence 3, down to the end).</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who comes back last from the village, from his round for alms, may eat if there be any food left (from the meal of the other Bhikkhus), if he desires to do so. If he does not desire to do so, he should throw away the leavings on the (ground at a place) which is free from grass, or pour them away into water in which there are no living things.

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus told this matter to the Bhikkhus. The Bhikkhus told it to the Blessed One. Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, after delivering a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

The chunam should be pounded, the clay moistened with water, and water poured into the water jar.</p>

					<p class="f4">'When entering the hot bath-room, the face should be smeared over with clay, and the person well covered up in front and behind before entering. A seat is not to be taken so as to hustle the senior Bhikkhus, and junior Bhikkhus are not to be ousted from their seats. If possible, shampooing is to be performed for the senior Bhikkhus in the hot bath-room.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Such an act has been already guarded against by the rule laid down at the end of <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 9. 5, where the same expression is made use of.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Upari-pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ito. On pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a (which we should possibly read here), as the lintel of a door, see our note above at <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 14, 3. It recurs immediately below, VIII, I, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Vissara<i>m</i> akāsi. As Childers, sub voce, expresses doubt as to the meaning of this word, it may be well to note that this phrase occurs above, <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 10, 2 and VI, 3, 4, and also in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya LX, and always in the sense here given.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The form of this speech bears very clear testimony to the artificial way in which these introductory stories are put together, for the speech does not arise out of the story. Similar instances are not infrequent. See VIII, 5, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Samma<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati is to sweep (not to scrub), as is apparent from Mahāvagga VI, 34, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> &Ucirc;ha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>i. So also at Mahāvagga I, 25, 15. At Mahāvagga I, 49, 4, we should have rendered 'defiled their beds' instead of 'threw their bedding about,' correcting uhananti of the text there into &ucirc;hadanti. &Ucirc;han (originally 'to throw up,' 'raise,' &amp;c.) seems, like sam&ucirc;han, to have acquired the meaning of to destroy, injure, spoil. From this meaning of spoiling, &ucirc;han evidently came to be used for, or confounded in the MS. with, &ucirc;had, 'to defile (with excrement).' So the phrase '&ucirc;hananti pi ummihanti pi' (at Mahāvagga I, 49, 4) exactly corresponds in meaning to 'omuttenti pi &ucirc;hadayanti pi' in Dhammapada, p. 283. There are other passages showing the same confusion. (1) The gerund, &ucirc;ha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, which occurs in <i>G</i>ātaka II, p. 71 ('idāni kho (ahan) ta<i>m</i> &ucirc;ha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a'), is explained by the commentator to mean 'va<i>k</i><i>k</i>an te s&icirc;se katva.' (2) &ucirc;hanti, in Gātaka II, p. 73 ('aggihutta<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a &ucirc;hanti, tena bhinnā kama<i>n</i><i>d</i>al&ucirc;ti'), must mean the same and be = &ucirc;hadeti. For the monkey here referred to is said to have been guilty of the following dirty trick:--'ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikā bhindati, aggisālāya va<i>k</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i> karoti.' (3) mutteti ohaneti at <i>K</i>ariyā Pi<i>t</i>aka II, 5, 4, represents u<i>k</i><i>k</i>āra-pasāvam katvā at <i>G</i>ātaka II, 385. In the first of these passages uha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a may well be a copyist's blunder, arising from the similarity of the words, for uha<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. Dr. Morris, to whom we owe the comparison of these passages and the suggested emendation of Mahāvagga I, 49, 4, is rather of opinion that the words were confounded by the writers. For it is not an uncommon thing to find two words, not very remote in form or meaning, confounded together. It is well known that the English word livelihood properly and originally meant 'liveliness,' and has only afterwards replaced the earlier livelode, to which the sense of livelihood properly belongs. And something of this kind <span class="f2 g"><b>[278]</b></span> must have occurred, he thinks&#8222;in Pāli in the use of &ucirc;han for it had. The past participle &ucirc;hata occurs at <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 10, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Bhummatthara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i>; usually, no doubt, matting of various kinds, but occasionally also skins or rugs of the kinds specially allowed by VI, 14, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Yathābhāga<i>m</i>. The use of this word here constitutes the only variation between our passage and that in the Mahāvagga I, 25 = below, VIII, 7, 2, where it is replaced by yathā<i>t</i><i>th</i>āne or yathāpa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atta<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> This passage throws a welcome light on the meaning of ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a and p&icirc;<i>th</i>a: for as they were to be beaten to get the dust out, it is clear that they were upholstered. The ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a, or bed, must have been a wooden framework, stuffed (probably with cotton), covered at the top with cotton cloth, and made underneath and at the sides of wood. It had no legs fixed to it, but was supported on movable tressels--the pa<i>t</i>ipādakā. When using it, the sleeper covered it with a mat, or a cotton sheet, and had over him a coverlet of some kind; and these articles, which he would also use if he slept on the ground, constituted, together with the bolster and pillows, the senāsana<i>m</i> or bedding,--that is, in the more special and limited use of that term (as, for instance, above, § 3, and perhaps below, 7, 1). In its larger sense the same word is used, putting the part for the whole, for the whole sleeping apparatus, and is nearly equivalent to seyyāyo (so, for instance, in VI, 11 and 12, and below, VIII, 2, I; 6, 2 and perhaps VIII, 7, 1; whereas the latter term is used in the same connection at VI, 6, <span class="f2 g"><b>[279]</b></span> and VI, II, 3). Sayana, in VI, 8, is a generic term including bed, couch, sofa, and divan, but probably with special reference to these three latter things used in the day-time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> The following paragraph occurs, word for word, at Mahāvagga I, 25, II, and below, VIII, 7, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> The following paragraph is the same as Mahāvagga I, 25,18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Sara<i>g</i>ā vātā. These are the well-known hot winds (like the sand-bearing simoom that blows from North Africa over Italy), against which modern residents endeavour to protect themselves by the use of 'tats.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> There were, of course, no windows in our modern sense, but only spaces left in the wall to admit light and air, and covered by lattices of three kinds allowed by VI, 2, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> The following paragraph is the same as Mahāvagga I, 25, 19, and part of it is repeated below, VIII, 10, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> &Acirc;<i>k</i>amana-kumbhi. This formed part of the sanitary apparatus for use in the privy. See above, Mahāvagga V, 8, 3, and below, <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 9 and 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> All the above expressions are used at the opening of Mahāvagga IX.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> This paragraph corresponds to the last paragraph of VIII, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Senāsana<i>m</i> āpu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ā. Compare the Old Commentary on the 14th and 15th Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas. The lengthening of the last vowel in āpu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ā is noteworthy.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> &Acirc;rāmiko. In Mahāvagga VI, 15, the king wishing to present a man for this purpose, it is there laid down that the Bhikkhus <span class="f2 g"><b>[283]</b></span> may accept him; and at <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 21, 3, a superintendent of such slaves is mentioned as one of the officials of the Order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> This is the usual method still adopted by native servants as a safeguard against white ants, who would eat up into the legs of furniture left standing on the ground.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> This arrangement is referred to above at VIII, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> A&#7749;gāni pi seseyyu<i>m</i>. See Buddhaghosa's note as appended to the edition of the text (p. 325).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> For the passages here implied, see I, 1, 2, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> A<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atarassa p&ucirc;gassa. This sentence has already occurred at V, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> On this use of iddho, compare ovādo iddho in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya LVI.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Anantarika<i>m</i> bhikkhu<i>m</i>. See the note on this phrase at VI, 10, 1. &Acirc;nantarika<i>m</i> in the text (with long ā) is a misprint.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> Vokkamma, which is not, as Childers supposes, equal to okkamma with euphonic v, but to vyavakramya or vyutkramya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Anupakha<i>g</i><i>g</i>a: which is here used, not in the sense it has at IV, 14, 1, but in the sense in which it is used in the 16th and 43rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas, in both which passages it is explained by the Old Commentary by anupavisitvā. This clause and the next occur also at Mahāvagga I, 25, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i<i>m</i> ottharitvā. This use of the Sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i is referred to at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 212, and above, I, 13, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Antaraghare. See Sekhiyas 3-26, repeated in the next section. It is perhaps doubtful whether this word may not mean here. (as in Sekhiya 27--below, § 6) the inner courtyard of a house which is surrounded by buildings; but we follow the interpretation we have adopted, loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> The following section repeats the Sekhiyas, Nos. 3-26, where see further notes. Much of it recurs below in VIII, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> Sagu<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> katvā. Compare Mahāvagga I, 25, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Ga<i>n</i><i>th</i>ika<i>m</i>. See the note on V, 29, 3. It was to prevent the robe being blown up by the wind. The word occurs again in VIII, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The following sentence is repeated, word for word, below, § 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>iggahe. See the note on V, 10, 3. Avakkāra-pāt&icirc;, at Mahāvagga IV, 1, 2 = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 3, seems to have very nearly the same meaning. The whole of this paragraph is repeated below, § 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Uttaribha&#7749;ga<i>m</i>. See the note on VI, 4, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> On the expressions in this sentence, compare the notes on Sekhiyas 27-32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> This paragraph repeats Sekhiyas 31-55, where see our notes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> This is the 57th Sekhiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> The bowl is always carried by the left hand under the robe. On pa<i>n</i>āmeti, see the note at V, 9, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> The following section is, word for word, parallel to Mahāvagga IV, I, 2-4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Avakkāra-pāt&icirc;. We have had pa<i>t</i>iggaha used just above (VIII, 4, 4) in a very similar sense and connection. The present word occurs also at Mahāvagga IV, I, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Vā<i>k</i>a<i>m</i> bhindati. To break silence by speaking. See Mahāvagga IV, 1, 3, where it makes good sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Ara<i>n</i>i-sahita<i>m</i>, on which Buddhaghosa merely says ara<i>n</i>i-sahite sati aggi<i>m</i> kātu<i>m</i> pi va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati. In the <i>G</i>ātaka Commentary (I, 212, ed. Fausb&ouml;ll) we have the phrase ara<i>n</i>i-sahita<i>m</i> n&icirc;haritvā aggi<i>m</i> karonti. At p. 34 of the Assalāyana Sutta (ed. Pischel) we hear of there being an upper and lower stick to the ara<i>n</i>i; and at p. 53 of the Milinda Pa<i>ñ</i>ha (ed. Trenckner) we find the same upper and lower sticks, the thong by which to turn the latter, and the piece of rag for tinder mentioned as the constituent parts of this ancient means of producing fire. The expression in the text is probably a collective term for the whole of these.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> They are all repeated in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Thavikā. This is possibly one of the bags referred to in the permission granted by Mahāvagga VIII, 20, but it was only to be used when the bowl had to be carried a long distance, and not when passing through a village. (See the beginning of the next section.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> khandhe katvā: either in contradistinction to <span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span> eka<i>m</i>sa<i>m</i> <i>k</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> katvā (on which question there is a great division among modern Buddhists. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 47), or possibly 'put it in a roll on his back.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> On this expression, see above, VIII, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga VIII, 13, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> A&#7749;gana. This is not 'courtyard,' as Childers renders it, but a part of the &Acirc;rāma, immediately in front of the hut or Vihāra, which is kept as an, open space, and daily swept. The Sinhalese name for it is midula; there those who sleep in the hut spend the greater part of the day, and not even grass is allowed to grow upon it. The term is a very common one, and its meaning is not doubtful. Compare the <i>G</i>ātaka book, I, 124, 151, 421; II, 249, 250, 345. Eka&#7749;gana<i>m</i> bhavati, at ibid. I, 53, 12, is to become one open space, as eka&#7749;gana<i>m</i> karoti at II, 357, is to clear a forest, and turn it into an open space.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> The order is slightly different, but all the details are the same. The only addition is that in speaking of taking out the floor covetings, he is directed to notice where they lay.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> All the preceding expressions have occurred at Mahāvagga I, 26, 1; see also 32, 1, and 38, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> <i>G</i>antāghara, not simply bath-room, but room in which hot or steam baths were taken. Most of the following expressions occur in Mahāvagga I, 25, 12, or above at V, 14, 3.</p>
