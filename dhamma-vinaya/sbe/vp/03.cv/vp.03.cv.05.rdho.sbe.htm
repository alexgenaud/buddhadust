And at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, used to rub<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> their bodies--thighs, and arms, and breast, and back--against wood. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as do so, like wrestlers, boxers, or shampooers<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>?' The Bhikkhus heard the people so murmuring, &amp;c.; and they told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, having convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, asked the Bhikkhus: 'Is this true, O Bhikkhus, what they say, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, when bathing, rub (&amp;c., as before)?'</p>

Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>

					<p class="f4">3. Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus used to bathe on an A<i>t</i><i>t</i>āna (a sort of shampooing stand<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>). The people (&amp;c., as before). The Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before). Then the Blessed One (&amp;c., as before, down to) addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'You are not to bathe, O Bhikkhus, on an A<i>t</i><i>t</i>āna.

And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha thought, 'How would it be if I were to have a bowl carved out of this block of sandal-wood, so that the chips<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn38" href="#n38">38</a>]</sup></span> shall remain my property, and I can give the bowl away?' And the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha had a bowl turned out of that block of sandal-wood, and put it in a balance, and had it lifted on to the top of a bamboo<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn39" href="#n39">39</a>]</sup></span>, and tying that bamboo at the top of a succession of bamboos, he let it be known, saying, 'If any Sama<i>n</i>a or Brahman be an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi, let him get down the bowl.

					<p class="f4">Then P&ucirc;ra<i>n</i>a Kassapa went to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, and said to him, 'I, O householder, am <a id="pg79"><span class="f2 g"><b>[79]</b></span></a> an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi. Give me the bowl.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'If, Sir, you are an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi, let your reverence get down the bowl!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Makkhali Gosāla, and A<i>g</i>ita Kesa-kambal&icirc;, and Pakudha Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana, and Sa<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>aya Bela<i>t</i><i>th</i>iputta, and Niga<i>n</i><i>th</i>a Nāta-putta went severally to the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha, [and preferred the same request, and received the same reply.]</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time the venerable Mahā Moggallāna and the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, having dressed themselves early in the morning, went into Rā<i>g</i>agaha, duly bowled and robed, for alms. And the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a said to the venerable Mahā Moggallāna: 'The venerable Mahā Moggallāna is both an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi.

					<p class="f4">'The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a also is both an Arahat and possessed of Iddhi. Go, friend Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, and fetch down the bowl, for this bowl belongs to thee.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, rising up in the air, took the bowl, and went thrice round Rā<i>g</i>agaha (in the air). And at that time the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha stood in his dwelling-place with his wife and children, and holding up his clasped hands in reverent salutation, he exclaimed, 'May the venerable Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a be pleased to descend upon our dwelling-place.' And the venerable Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a descended into his dwelling-place. Then the Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Rā<i>g</i>agaha took the bowl from the hands of the venerable Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, and filled it with costly food, and presented it to the venerable Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a. And <a id="pg80"><span class="f2 g"><b>[80]</b></span></a> the venerable Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a took the bowl, and departed to his &Acirc;rāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">2. Now the people heard, 'The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, they say, has got down the Rā<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl.' And those people, with shouts loud and long, followed in the steps of Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a. And the Blessed One heard the shouts loud and long, and on hearing them he asked the venerable &Acirc;nanda, 'What now, &Acirc;nanda, does this so great shouting mean?'</p>

					<p class="f4">The venerable Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, Lord, has got down the Rā<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl; and the people thereof are following in his steps with shouts loud and long.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened a meeting of the Bhikkhu-Saŋgha, and asked Pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, 'Is it true, as they say, that you, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, have got down the Rā<i>g</i>agaha Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's bowl?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can you, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, for the sake of a miserable wooden pot, display before the laity the superhuman quality of your miraculous power of Iddhi? Just, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, like a woman who displays herself for the sake of a miserable piece of money<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn40" href="#n40">40</a>]</sup></span>, have you, for the sake of a miserable <a id="pg81"><span class="f2 g"><b>[81]</b></span></a> wooden pot displayed before the laity the superhuman quality of your miraculous power of Iddhi. This will not conduce, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, either to the conversion of the unconverted, or to the increase of the converted; but rather to those who have not been converted remaining unconverted, and to the turning back of those who have been converted.'</p>

Then the Blessed One looked round at the venerable &Acirc;nanda.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the venerable &Acirc;nanda said to Bodhi the king's son, 'Let them gather up, O prince, these cloths.

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, on that occasion and in that connection, convened an assembly of the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, and after he had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'You are not, O Bhikkhus, to walk upon cloth laid down (for ceremonial purposes). Whosoever does so, shall be guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a.'</p>

But it is difficult to see how that fits in with the connection here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> So Buddhaghosa loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> A wooden instrument in the shape of a hand, which was firs; covered with chunam (fine lime), and then rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note at p. 315 of H.O.'s edition of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Apparently a string of beads which was first covered with the chunam made from Kuruvindaka stone (a ruby-coloured stone), and then held at both ends and rubbed over the body. See Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> As Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this by 'rubbing their bodies up against each other'(!), vigayha has here probably nothing to do with gāh, but is simply vig<i>ri</i>hya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> A kind of back-scratcher, made according to Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., by placing together, by the roots, hooks made of the teeth of crocodiles (makara-dantaka; see V, 11, 6; VI, 3, 2), which had previously been split. Such hooks of split crocodiles' teeth are mentioned in the text itself below, V, 9, 2; and pins or hooks made of raga's teeth at V, 9, 5, and VI, 3, 5 (nāga-dantaka), and V, It, 7 (nāga-danta).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., makes this phrase mean only 'made of teeth that had not been previously split.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., explains this word by vattova<i>t</i><i>t</i>i; which is to us equally unintelligible.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Pudhu-pā<i>n</i>ikan ti hattha-parikamma<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati. Tasmā sabbesa<i>m</i> hatthena pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>i-parikamma<i>m</i> kātu<i>m</i> va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Vallikā ti ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>ato nikkhanta-mutt-olambakād&icirc;na<i>m</i> eta<i>m</i> adhiva<i>k</i>ana<i>m</i>. Na kevala<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a vallikā eva, ya<i>m</i> ki<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>i ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-pilandhana<i>m</i> antamaso tāla-panna<i>m</i> pi na va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati (B.). Compare satavallika<i>m</i> at V, 29, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Pāma&#7749;ga. The meaning of which is not clear from Buddhaghosa's note loc. cit. It occurs also at D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa XII, 1, and below in Buddhaghosa's note on maddavi<i>n</i>a at V, 29, 2 (twice).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Ka<i>t</i>i-suttaka<i>m</i>. This is not mentioned in the similar paragraph at V, 29, 2, where all special kinds of girdles are enumerated. It is forbidden below to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s at X, 16.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>ika. This word is explained by Buddhaghosa as the same as valaya<i>m</i>. Ova<i>t</i><i>t</i>iya occurs, apparently in a different sense, at Mahāvagga VII, 1, 5, and the present word in Buddhaghosa on sata-vallika<i>m</i> at V, 29, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Kāyura, on which Buddhaghosa, loc. cit., merely says that the meaning of this, and of the following words, is evident. But the <i>G</i>ātaka commentary (Fausb&ouml;ll III, 437, 14) says kāy&ucirc;an ti g&icirc;vāya pilandhana-pasādhana<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Osa<i>n</i>heti. Compare the Sanskrit <i>s</i>laksh<i>n</i>ayati. The art of hair-dressing had, at the time when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was composed, been already carried to a high state of efficiency in the valley of the Ganges, as may reasonably be concluded from the numerous kinds of headdresses figured in bas-relief on some of the oldest Buddhist sculptures.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Pha<i>n</i>akenā ti dantamayādisu yena kena<i>k</i>i (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Hattha-pha<i>n</i>akenā ti hatthen&#8217; eva pha<i>n</i>aka-ki<i>k</i><i>k</i>a<i>m</i> karonti, a&#7749;gul&icirc;hi osa<i>n</i>henti (B.). It is clear from this last explanation that the pha<i>n</i>aka was a kind of very primitive brush, but without bristles. In passing the fingers through the hair the fingers are naturally held separate, slightly forward, and stiff--precisely as one would hold them if one wished to imitate the hood of a cobra. To make a real brush with bristles was evidently beyond the mechanical appliances of those times, or such an article would certainly have been mentioned in this connection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> On the use of Telaka, compare Mahāvagga VI, 13, I, and Sittha-telaka at <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 3, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Compare <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 10, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> All these practices are seriatim forbidden to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s also in <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 10, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> The following section recurs, almost word for word, of the Bhikkhun&icirc;s, in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya X (Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, vol. ii, p. 267).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Giragga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>a. Compare D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa XXI, 32, and Mahāva<i>m</i>sa, p. 214, line 2. It occurs also in the Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on the 37th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and Buddhaghosa there explains it as follows: Giragga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o ti girimhi agga-sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o girissa vā agga-dese sama<i>g</i><i>g</i>o. He is evidently in doubt about the word, which is probably connected with ancient local worship or custom, a worship in high-places, as little allied to Vedic Brahmanism as it was to Buddhism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> &Acirc;yatakena g&icirc;ta-ssarena. Compare āyataken&#8217; eva papāto at <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Probably this is supposed to result because dhamma being sung and not said is not intelligible to them--a complaint often made against the singing of prayers among Protestant Christians. On pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>imā <i>g</i>anatā, compare the closing words of V, 21, 2; and on the rest of the phrase, Puggala III, 10, 14 The translation of sarakutti<i>m</i> is also very doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Sara-bha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i>. So in the Mahāvagga we hear that So intoned before the Buddha a chapter from the Sutta Nipāta. The expression there used is sarena abhāsi, of which our word is used as the verbal noun, the roots bha<i>n</i> and bhās being not only synonymous but interchangeable. (See, for instance, Vin. Pit. vol. iv, p. 353.) Perhaps 'recitative' would be a good rendering. I have several times heard the Dhamma thus recited by living Buddhists in accordance with the traditional interpretation of this passage, and their Sara-bha<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> was precisely like the intoning of prose passages as practised in our cathedral churches (Rh. D.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Bāhira-lomi<i>m</i>-<i>u</i><i>n</i><i>n</i>im. Literally, 'with the fleece outside.' Compare Mahāvagga V, 10, 4, and the Ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>ima S&icirc;la, § 5 (p. 193 of Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas').</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa gives in the Samanta Pāsādikā on the 11th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya the following explanations of these terms. Aggi-parigitan ti agginā pari<i>g</i>ita<i>m</i> abhibh&ucirc;ta<i>m</i> da<i>d</i><i>dh</i>a<i>m</i> phu<i>t</i><i>th</i>an ti attho. The reading pari<i>g</i>ita<i>m</i> is correct and should be inserted in the text for pari<i>k</i>ita<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Sattha-pari<i>g</i>itan ti satthena pari<i>g</i>ita<i>m</i> abhibh&ucirc;ta<i>m</i> <i>kh</i>inna<i>m</i> viddha<i>m</i> vā ti attho. Esa nayo nakha-pari<i>g</i>ite (B., loc. cit.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> These last two clauses have already occurred at Mahāvagga VI, 21. The principle of the injunction throughout its five divisions is one and the same--the seed, or the capacity of fructification, must either have never existed, or have passed away, or have been destroyed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> This ancient legend has been expanded into a <i>G</i>ātaka story, under the title of Khandha-vatta <i>G</i>ātaka, No. 203 in Professor Fausb&ouml;ll's edition (vol. ii, pp. 144-148), in which recur all the verses here given as a snake-charm. The names of the serpents are derived from the ancient mythology, and are not to be supposed to refer to actual breeds of real snakes. Below, <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 2, 5, where a Bhikkhu is bitten by a snake, the simple precaution enjoined is the use of a higher bedstead.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> This phrase occurs in the passage at Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta I, 31, by which Buddhaghosa is so much perplexed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> This is only one of the many passages from which it is evident that in the oldest Buddhism only the seven Buddhas, from Vipassi down to Gotama inclusive, were known by name to the members of the Buddhist community. Compare Rh. D.'s 'Hibbert Lectures, 1881,' p. 142. It is nevertheless probable that, with their ideas as to the infinite number of worlds which had succeeded one another in the past, they considered that the number of previous Buddhas had also been infinite.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> This last injunction, which comes in here so tamely, is omitted in the <i>G</i>ātaka story, and is merely a hook on which to hang an excuse for introducing this ancient and evidently favourite prescription into the Vinaya. That it is quite out of place is sufficiently evident from the fact that it has already been laid down in identical terms in the Mahāvagga VI, 14, 4, where it is found in its natural connection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Anabhiratiyā p&icirc;<i>li</i>to attano a&#7749;ga<i>g</i>ātam <i>kh</i>indi. This anabhirati is constantly referred to, and always as the result of falling in love, or in connection with sexual desire.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> A Burmese version of the following legend is translated by Bishop Bigandet in his 'Legend of the Burmese Buddha,' vol. ii, pp. 212-216 (Third Edition).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>andana-gan<i>th</i>&icirc; uppannā hoti ti <i>k</i>andana-gha<i>t</i><i>t</i>ikā uppannā hoti (B.). Compare ga<i>n</i><i>th</i>ikā at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 150 = ga<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikā at ibid. II, 124, and our note below on that word at V, 29, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> Lekha<i>m</i>. It is clear from V, 9, 2, below, and Buddhaghosa's note there, that likhitu<i>m</i> is used in the sense of 'to plane' or 'to adze' wood or metal; and the Sinhalese MSS. read here likha<i>m</i> instead of lekha<i>m</i>. It cannot be 'to turn,' as the turning lathe is quite a modern invention.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> A similar proceeding is related of a Bhikkhu at 24, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Māsaka-r&ucirc;passa. On the māsaka, see Rh. D.'s 'Ancient Coins and Measures, &amp;c.,' p. 13. It is evident from the use of the word r&ucirc;pa here that stamped pieces of money were known in the valley of the Ganges as early as the time when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was composed. The word occurs also below at <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, X.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Compare the 4th Pārā<i>g</i>ika.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> The use of sandal-wood for this purpose is allowed by the closing words of Mahāvagga VI, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> This injunction is repeated below in the summary at V, 37.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> It is clear from verses 192-196 of the 13th chapter of the Rā<i>g</i>a-nigha<i>n</i><i>t</i>u, written by Narahari of Kashm&icirc;r in the thirteenth century A. D., that at that time Vai<i>d</i>&ucirc;rya meant 'cat's-eye: But it is uncertain whether that was the only meaning of the word ve<i>l</i>uriya at the time when this passage was composed. (See especially V. 124, p. 25, of Dr. Richard Garbe's edition in his work, 'Die Indischen Mineralien,' Leipzig, 1882.) See also Professor Max M&uuml;ller's interesting note at p. 266 of his 'What can India teach us?'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> Kā<i>k</i>amayo. There was probably no glass in our modern sense of the word when the <i>K</i>ullavagga was written. But kā<i>k</i>a is a silicious earth, and some sort of glass-like earthenware may very well have been in use. The phrase has already occurred, together with all the others in this passage, at Mahāvagga V, 8, 3, of foot-coverings, but is omitted in the list at Khudda Sikkhā V. 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Gha<i>m</i>s&icirc;yati. Literally, 'were rubbed.' See below, § 3, and our note below on V, 9, 2, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> A<i>k</i><i>kh</i>&ucirc;piyanti. On the use of this word, compare Mahāvagga VIII, 14, 1, where it is used of inserting a slip of cloth in a torn garment.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> See our note above on V, 8, I. Buddhaghosa says here likhitun ti tanu-kara<i>n</i>-atthāy&#8217; eta<i>m</i> vutta<i>m</i>. The 'shaping' may be by carving, adzing, or planing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Compare above, V, 8, 1, and see Buddhaghosa's note at p. 316 of the edition of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> The reading is corrupt; and therefore this rendering is merely conjectural. See H.O.'s note at p. 316 of his edition of the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> On these split crocodiles' teeth, see our note above on V, 1, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> R&ucirc;pakoki<i>n</i><i>n</i>āni bhati-kamma-katāni. Buddhaghosa has nothing on these words. On the second, see below, VI, 2, 7, and H.O.'s note on that passage at p. 321 of the edition of the text. It is most probable that the reading in both passages should be bhatti-kamma, 'patchwork,' as further explained in our note below on VI, 2, 7; and we have translated accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Otāpetvā. The word has already occurred in Mahāvagga I, 25, 16. Compare Khudda Sikkhā V. 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Vodaka<i>m</i> katvā. Vodaka<i>m</i> bears, of course, the same relation to sa-udaka<i>m</i>, used just before, as vagga does to samagga. The expression has occurred already at Mahāvagga I, 25, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> Vāta-ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>alikāya. So also in the next section and in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya 96. The reading at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 72 is vāta-ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Mi<i>dh</i>ante. This word recurs below in VI, 2, 3, where see our note. Buddhaghosa's note is given at p. 317 of the edition of the text. See also Khudda Sikkhā V. 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> Used of a house, this probably means a plastered flooring of scented earth or dried cowdung. See <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 17, 1, and Buddhaghosa's note there. On the use of the word in tailoring, see Mahāvagga VII, 1, 5, VIII, 21. Buddhaghosa, loc. cit. (p. 3 i 7), uses the expression mattika-paribha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-katāya-bh&ucirc;miyā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Nikku<i>g</i><i>g</i>anti. See the use of this word at V, 20, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Ti<i>n</i>a-santhāraka<i>m</i>. That this word means a mat, and not a layer, of grass is clear from its use at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 360, and below, V, II, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>olaka. The meaning of the word is doubtful, but see Mahāvagga VIII, 18. In the uddāna (at p. 143) the corresponding word is <i>k</i>ola. See also below, VI, 3, I, VI, 19, VI, 20, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Patta-mālaka<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa says merely, 'It should be made either of bricks or of wood.' He confirms the reading of the text (with <i>l</i> as against Childers's reading mālako).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Patta-ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>olikā ti mahā-mukha-ku<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-sa<i>n</i><i>th</i>ānā bhandakukkha<i>li</i>knā vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati (B.). Ka<i>n</i><i>d</i>ola is a wicker-work basket; see B&ouml;htlingk-Roth, sub voce.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> See H.O.'s note on the reading here; and compare the table of contents to this chapter (at p. 143), where the reading a<i>m</i>sabaddha<i>m</i> confirms the suggested alteration. If there were any further doubt it would be removed on comparing the closing words of Mahāvagga VI, 12, 4, which are identical with the present passage and contain the correct reading. The same remarks apply to other passages, where the same words occur below, V, It, 5, V, 12, VI, 12, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> The use of these appliances is formally allowed at VI, 3, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a. Compare Rh. D.'s note at p. 277 of the 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' and Khuddha Sikkhā V. 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Sati-sammosā. The word occurs at Milinda-pa<i>n</i>ha (ed. Trenckner), p. 260. It must be connected with mu<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-sati, of which the Buddhist Sanskrit equivalent is mushita-sm<i>ri</i>ti<i>h</i> (see Kathā Sarit Sāgara 56, 289). It is evident that Childers's original explanation of mu<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-sati from m&ucirc;<i>lh</i>a was wrong, and that both words must be referred to the root mush, as he points out at p. .618 of his Dictionary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Kavāta<i>m</i> pa<i>n</i>āmetvā. The construction of doors is described in detail at V, 14, 3, with reference to the bath-house, and again at VI, 2. That pa<i>n</i>āmeti is to open, and not to shut, is clear from VIII, 1, 1, just as patta<i>m</i> pa<i>n</i>āmeti at VIII, 5, 2 is to uncover, disclose, the bowl. Compare Khuddha Sikkhā V. 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> Tumba-ka<i>t</i>āhan ti lāpu-ka<i>t</i>āha<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati (B.). Tumba is gourd, according to B&ouml;htlingk-Roth. See Khuddha Sikkhā V. 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> Gha<i>t</i>i-ka<i>t</i>āhan ti gha<i>t</i>i-kapāla<i>m</i> (B.). The whole section is repeated in the text of each kind of vessel.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> Vissara<i>m</i> akāsi, on the use of which idiom see the passages quoted below, <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> Pisā<i>k</i>illikā. See below, 27, 5, and Mahāvagga III, 12, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> This list recurs in the Old Commentary on the 10th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga. As an explanation of vighāsa, Buddhaghosa says here u<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ittodakan ti mukha-vikkhālanodaka<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>iggaho. Slop-basin, waste-tub, 'receptacle' for odd bits. It is so used below at VIII, 4, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> Vipa<i>t</i>etvā. The three MSS. read vippādetvā, the same corrected to vipphādetvā, and vipphāmetvā. M for L is a common-mistake in Sinhalese MSS., and the correct reading may possibly be vipphāletvā, if it is not vipphā<i>t</i>etvā, as suggested in H.O.'s note, vol. v, p. 259.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Namatakan ti satthaka-ve<i>th</i>anaka<i>m</i> pilotika-kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i> (B.). The word occurs again below at V, 19, I, V, 27, I, and X, 10, 4 (where the nuns are forbidden to use it). Namata is felt; and nāmatika-a&#7749;ga, the wearing of felt, is inserted by some Sanskrit Buddhist writers in the list of Dhuta&#7749;gas. (Burnout, Introduction, &amp;c., p. 306.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>akitā hont&icirc; ti malagga-kitā (B.). Mala may probably here. mean 'rust,' if the needles were made of iron. Ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>akitā, 'spoiled,' is used of plastered walls and the floors of a Vihāra at Mahāvagga I, 25, 15 = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 3; and pa<i>m</i>su-kitā occurs just below in our present passage. Compare also the note on vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a<i>m</i> in the following section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> S&ucirc;<i>k</i>i-nā<i>li</i>ka<i>m</i>. On these needle-cases compare the Introductory Story to the 10th <i>G</i>ātaka. It is Pā<i>k</i>ittiya to have them made of ivory, horn, or bone. (80th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, but they are there called S&ucirc;<i>k</i>i-ghara<i>m</i>.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> The use of this gum for medicine purposes is allowed at Mahāvagga VI, 7, where see our note. The present use is again mentioned below, V, 27, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> Sarita-sibbā<i>t</i>ikan ti madhu-sitthaka-pilotika<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a<i>m</i> hoti. See the note on this expression at Mahāvagga VI, 21, I. The 'robes' were lengths of cloth, and 'out of shape' (vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a<i>m</i>) must mean either that one side was larger than the other, so that each corner (ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>o) was not a right angle, or perhaps that each edge (ka<i>n</i><i>n</i>o) was not straight.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> What Ka<i>th</i>ina may meats in this connection is not exactly clear to us, but it is evidently a sort of framework, or bench, for the tailors to lay out their work upon. Our notes above on the 1st Nissaggiya and on Mahāvagga VII, 1, 3, refer to a different and secondary use of the word in the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremonies--so-called doubtless because the Ka<i>th</i>ina-dussa (the supply of cloth to be dyed, sewn, and made up into robes, and distributed, on one and the same day) was to be so sewn with the aid of the Ka<i>th</i>ina here referred to. Buddhaghosa says here, Ka<i>th</i>inan ti nisse<i>n</i>i pi tattha attharita-ka<i>t</i>asāraka-kila<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ana<i>m</i> a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>atara<i>m</i> pi ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati yāya dupa<i>t</i><i>t</i>a-<i>k</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> sibbenti ka<i>th</i>ine <i>k</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> pi bandhanti. On Dupa<i>t</i><i>t</i>a, see Mahāvagga VIII, 14, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The use of obandhitvā (in reference to the Ka<i>th</i>ina), in opposition to sambandhitvā (in reference to the mere stakes), is worthy of notice.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> Paribhi<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati. Perhaps we should translate, 'did not hold together.' See the last section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> On these terms, which we do not attempt to translate, see Buddhaghosa's notes as quoted by H.O. at p. 317 of the edition of the text. The first seems to be a Ka<i>th</i>ina with a cross-bar, but da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a at V, 11, 1, and V, 13, 3, means handle.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> Vinandhana-ra<i>g</i><i>g</i>u<i>m</i> vinandhana-suttaka<i>m</i>. See Buddhaghosa's notes loc. cit., and compare Mahāvagga V, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Visamā honti ti kā<i>k</i>i khuddakā honti kā<i>k</i>i mahantā (B.). Sutta here probably means those threads or strings just referred to by which the stuff was to be tied on to the Ka<i>th</i>ina.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> Ka<i>li</i>mbhaka<i>m</i>: so explained by Buddhaghosa, loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> Mogha-suttaka<i>m</i>. Buddhaghosa says, 'the making of a mark with a green thread, as carpenters do on wood with a black thread.' Compare also our notes 2 and 3 on Mahāvagga VII, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> The whole section is repeated in the text at length for each of these three cases.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> Pa<i>t</i>iggaho, 'receptacle' for the finger. See our note above on V, 10, 3, where the same word means a waste-tub. For other secondary uses of the word, see <i>G</i>ātaka I, 146, II, 9, 26. Buddhaghosa says here, pa<i>t</i>iggahan ti a&#7749;guli-kosaka<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> So of ointment-boxes, Mahāvagga VII, 12, 1; and of scissors, above, V, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> That is, to build it on a raised platform, the technical term for which is <i>k</i>aya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> See our note below on V, 14, 3. The whole passage recurs of the lining of a well at V, 16, 2, and of Vihāras themselves at VI, 3, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> &Acirc;lambana-bāha<i>m</i>. At Mahā-sudassana Sutta I, 59, there is a description of flights of stairs (sopānā), each of which had thambhā, evidently posts or banisters; s&ucirc;<i>k</i>iyo, apparently cross-bars let in to these banisters; and u<i>n</i>h&icirc;sa<i>m</i>, either a head-line running along the top of the banisters, or a figure-head at the lower end of such a head-line. (See Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 262.) This and the previous paragraphs are repeated below, V, 14, 2, of the <i>K</i>a&#7749;kama.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga V, 11, where the same technical term (ogumpheti) is used. Buddhaghosa's note is given at p. 317 of the text. See also V, 14, 3, below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Geruka-parikamma<i>m</i>. This reading, and not gerika, is confirmed by VI, 3, 1, VI, 17, 1, where the two previous words also occur. On this mode of preparing walls and floors, see our note below on VI, 20.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-pa<i>t</i>ika<i>m</i> or -pa<i>t</i><i>th</i>ika<i>m</i>, a term of doubtful signification which recurs, together with all the previous words, in the Old Commentary on the 19th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. Compare pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-prastha in B<i>R</i>. The word is perhaps however connected with Sanskrit pa<i>t</i><i>t</i>ikā, as <i>k</i>ela-pattikam at V, 21, 2 undoubtedly is. It occurs below, in a similar connection, at VI, 3, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> Go-gha<i>m</i>sikāya. Compare pāda-gha<i>m</i>sani at 22. 1; and on the use of sa<i>m</i>harati in a similar connection, see VI, 2, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> Nāga-dante. See the note on Mallaka at <i>K</i>ullavagga V, I, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> This is merely introduced to show that the following rules or privileges in this and the next chapter (§§ 1, 2) were to be in force when the Bhikkhus were on a journey.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> Neither here nor in V, 11, 5 are we to understand that the needles and scissors are to be carried in bags. They are mentioned in both passages merely to show the inconvenience of having no separate receptacles for the thimbles and the drugs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> See the note on V, 9, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> He would require the sandals only when he came, in his journey, to rough places; not on the smooth, well-trodden, village paths.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> The rule, that is, against destroying the life of living things.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> Ka<i>t</i>a<i>k</i><i>kh</i>u-parissāvana<i>m</i> nāma t&icirc;su da<i>n</i><i>d</i>akesu vinandhitvā kata<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> Dhamma-karaka<i>m</i>. Doubtless a water-pot with a strainer so fixed into it that a quantity of water could be filtered quickly. The word occurs at Mahāva<i>m</i>sa, p. 90, and below, VI, 21, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> So tasmi<i>m</i> upanandhi. The Introductory Story in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on the 36th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya is, so far, word for word the same as this section. Buddhaghosa there explains upanandhi by <i>g</i>anita-upanāho. See vol. iv, p. 359, of H.O.'s edition of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka. The Introductory Story to the 31st <i>G</i>ātaka is also based on a similar incident, and there the corresponding expression is vivāda<i>m</i> aka<i>m</i>su. (Fausb&ouml;ll's <i>G</i>ātaka, vol. i, p. 198.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> In the <i>G</i>ātaka commentary this tragic result of the refusal is absent. The Bhikkhu who has no strainer merely drinks without straining. (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' vol. i, p. 278.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> Adhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ātabbo, that is, the Bhikkhu is to determine in his mind that that part of his robe is a strainer for the time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> Navakamma<i>m</i> karonti. On the use of this and allied idioms, see <i>G</i>ātaka I, 92, line 22; <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 18, 1, VI, 5, 2; Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pārā<i>g</i>ika I, 1; Indian Antiquary XI, 29; Senart's Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana, p. 189.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> Na sammati, which is curious. For 'did not suffice,' the standing expression would be na ppahoti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> Da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-parissāvana<i>m</i>. Apparently a long box, both ends of which strain the water, which is poured into the middle by means of a pipe (da<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka). Buddhaghosa says, Da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a-parisāvanan ti (sic; only one s) ra<i>g</i>anakāna<i>m</i> khāra-parisāvana<i>m</i> viya <i>k</i>atusu pādesu baddha-nise<i>n</i>ikāya sā<i>t</i>aka<i>m</i> bandhitvā ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>e da<i>n</i><i>d</i>ake udaka<i>m</i> āsi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>itabba<i>m</i>.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> Makasa-ku<i>t</i>ikā ti <i>k</i>&icirc;vara-ku<i>t</i>ikā (B.). Literally, a 'mosquito hut,' the walls of which are to be of cloth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> Abhisannakāyā ti semhādi-dos&#8217;-ussanna-kāyā (B.). This word has already occurred at Mahāvagga VI, 14, 7, where Buddhaghosa's explanation is much the same. See also Mahāvagga VIII, 1, 30.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>a&#7749;kama. A straight piece of ground cleared and levelled for the purpose of walking up and down upon for exercise and meditation. See our note on this word at Mahāvagga V, 1, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> <i>G</i>antāghara. See our note above on Mahāvagga I, 25, 12. It was not ordinarily used for cold baths, which were taken in the rivers or tanks, but for a kind of hot-water bath, or perhaps steam bath, the exact mode of taking or administering which is not as yet certain. Several Bhikkhus took the bath at the same time, but it is not likely that they got into the water (though the expression uttarati is used, loc. cit., of their leaving the bath), as they scarcely would have made vessels large enough to contain a man. It rather seems that they sat on stools close to a large fire, and had water poured over them. The use of this kind of bath is forbidden to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s at <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 27, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> All the following paragraphs are the same as above, V, 11, 6, where see our notes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> As we have pointed out above, in our note on Mahāvagga V, 1, 14, it is not probable that the Ka&#7749;kama at first had a roof and stairs and balustrade. These were later improvements.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> Vedikā. See Mahā-sudassana Sutta I, 60, and Rh. D.'s note there ('Buddhist Suttas,' p. 262), and below, VI, 2, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>a&#7749;kamana-sāla, already referred to at Mahāvagga III, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> Pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>a<i>m</i>. See Childers under sa&#7749;ghā<i>t</i>a, and the Samanta Pāsādikā on the 19th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. Kavā<i>t</i>a-pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a occurs in Mahāvagga I, 25, 15, and in the Samanta Pāsādikā on Pā<i>k</i>ittiya 19 (compare upari-pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>iti at <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 1), and this and the two following phrases below, VI, 2, 1. Buddhaghosa has nothing on them, either here or there; and they were probably therefore in quite common use even in his day. The whole of this paragraph recurs below, VI, 3, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> Udukkhalika<i>m</i>. Presumably the door had no hinges, but the upper and lower ends of one side projected into hollows pre-pared for them in the lintel and the threshould. This suggestion is confirmed by the connection in which these words are used at VI, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> Uttara-pāsaka<i>m</i>. See the last note. Pāsaka recurs also in the next but one. Compare aggala-pāsaga in Ayāra&#7749;ga Sutta II, 1, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> Aggala-va<i>t</i><i>t</i>i nāma dvāra-bāhāye samappamā<i>n</i>o yeva aggalatthambho vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati yattha t&icirc;ni <i>k</i>attāri <i>kh</i>iddāni katvā s&ucirc;<i>k</i>iyo denti (B.).</p>

The word recurs in the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta V, 32, where it is said of &Acirc;nanda that he kapis&icirc;saka<i>m</i> ālambitvā a<i>t</i><i>th</i>āsi, just as in the Mahā-sudassana Sutta II, 24 it is said of the queen under similar circumstances that she dvāra-bāha<i>m</i> ālambitvā a<i>t</i><i>th</i>āsi. Buddhaghosa's commentary on the word in the former of these two passages is given by Rh. D. in his note at p. 95 of the 'Buddhist Suttas.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> S&ucirc;<i>k</i>ikā ti tattha (that is, kapi-s&icirc;sake) ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>e <i>kh</i>idda<i>m</i> katvā pavesitā (B.). Apparently a pin to pass through the monkey's head so as to secure the bolt in its place after it has been shot into the cavity. See the next note and below, VI, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> Gha<i>t</i>ikā ti upari-yo<i>g</i>itā (B.). At <i>G</i>ātaka I, 360 (compare <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 1, 2), we are told of a man who dvārāni pidahanto sabba-dvāresu s&ucirc;<i>k</i>igha<i>t</i>ikādayo datvā tala<i>m</i> (sic, query tāla<i>m</i>) abhiruhitvā tattha pi dvāram pidahitvā nis&icirc;di. As the principal bolt was probably called aggala (unless that were the name for the whole machinery), this was some smaller bolt. And in <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, I an instance is given of a man undoing the bolt (gha<i>t</i>ikam ugghā<i>t</i>etvā) of an uninhabited vihāra, such as is referred to in VI, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> Tāla<i>k</i><i>kh</i>idda<i>m</i>. See the end of VI, 2, 1, and Childers under the word tā<i>l</i>o. Buddhaghosa says nothing. The word tāla occurs in the last note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> &Acirc;vi<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>ana-<i>k</i><i>kh</i>iddam āvi<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>ana-ra<i>g</i><i>g</i>u<i>m</i>. These are said in VI, 2, 1 to be necessary because the door could not be put to, and doubtless have the meaning above assigned to them. &Acirc;vi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>i (or āvi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>i?) at Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa II, 4, 9, means he drew towards himself; and &Acirc;vi<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>anā (āvi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>anā?), ibid. II, 2, 2, is used as an equivalent of āka<i>d</i><i>dh</i>anā, which is much the same thing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> Ku<i>d</i><i>d</i>a-pādo. Compare Rh. D.'s note on Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta V, 41. The phrase recurs below of Vihāras at VI, 3, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>alika<i>m</i> kātun ti n&icirc;<i>k</i>a-vatthuka<i>m</i> <i>k</i>initu<i>m</i> (B.). <i>K</i>ināti is the technical word for laying bricks one above another; the comment therefore means 'to line or face the lower part with bricks.' (Compare pokkharaniyo i<i>t</i><i>th</i>ikāhi <i>k</i>initu<i>m</i> at Mahāsudassana Sutta I, 58; Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 262, 'to face the ponds with bricks or tiles;' and on facing a well below, V, 16, 2.)</p>

The whole of this paragraph recurs below, V, 35, 4, of the ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka to a privy; and the two passages taker together show that an entrance room or passage, a porch or ante-chamber, is meant, in which the water was kept ready for use For that reason this particular kind of ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka is elsewhere called, in both connections, udaka-ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka (Mahāvagga VI, 14, 3, of the bath-room--where see Buddhaghosa's note quoted in our 'Vinaya Texts,' vol. ii, p. 57--and Dhammapada, p. 103, of the privy).

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup> So also above, 11. 6 (at the end), and 14. 2 (at the end).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> This rule abrogates that laid down in chapter 15, so far as regards bathing and shampooing.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> All this refers doubtless to the kind of shed or portico to be erected over the well. (See below.) One would expect that the formal licence for such a ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>apa would have been inserted here in due course as above, 11. 6, for the Ka<i>th</i>ina-sālā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup> This is the usual Anglo-Indian term for the creepers so commonly used for such purposes. The Pāli word is vallikā, which occurs in a different sense at V, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> Tulā. This is the ordinary and simple machine, so common in all countries where irrigation is carried on, for raising water from canals or from shallow wells. Buddhaghosa says here: Tulan ti pa<i>n</i><i>n</i>ikāna<i>m</i> viya udaka abbhāhana-tulā. Pa<i>n</i><i>n</i>ika is 'florist' (see <i>G</i>ātaka I, 411, II, 180). Abbhāhana must be wrong (see Sutta Nipāta III, 8, 8); possibly abbhāvāhana is the correct reading.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> The name of this machine is spelt differently in the MSS. (karaka<i>t</i>a&#7749;ka the Sinhalese MS., and karaka<i>d</i>aka the Burmese MSS.), and the reading is doubtful. Buddhaghosa says: Dakadaka<i>t</i>ako (sic! In the next note but two the same MS. reads ka<i>t</i>adaka<i>t</i>ake) vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati go<i>n</i>e vā yo<i>g</i>etvā hatthehi vā gahetvā d&icirc;gha-varattād&icirc;hi āka<i>d</i><i>dh</i>ana-yanta<i>m</i>. We can only say negatively that the word can have nothing to do either with karka<i>t</i>aka, a hook in the form of a crab's claw; or with kara-ka<i>n</i><i>t</i>aka, finger-nail.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>akkava<i>t</i><i>t</i>aka<i>m</i>, on which Buddhaghosa has the unintelligible note arahatta(!)-gha<i>t</i>i-yanta<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup> Vārake. The spelling of this word in Childers's Dictionary (varāko) is a misprint. Both the passages he quotes read vārako. Other water-vessels, besides these three, are allowed by the closing rule of this chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n189" href="#fn189">189</a>]</sup> These are two of the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus; and the evil deeds of the followers form the subject of <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 4, 5 and following sections. Our sections 1, 2 are nearly the same as g 8, 9 there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n190" href="#fn190">190</a>]</sup> See the note above on IV, 4, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n191" href="#fn191">191</a>]</sup> Patta<i>m</i> nikku<i>g</i><i>g</i>atu. This phrase is used in the ordinary signification above, V, 9, 4. It is characteristic of the mildness of early Buddhism that this should be the only penalty imposed upon a layman. Compare H.O.'s remarks in his 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde,' pp. 391-393. The house of such a layman becomes then an ago<i>k</i>aro, 'an unlawful resort.' (<i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 2.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n192" href="#fn192">192</a>]</sup> Asambhoga<i>m</i> sa<i>m</i>ghena karotu. This phrase is used in regard to a Bhikkhu at <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 25, 1, as the distinctive mark of the Act of Suspension (Ukkhepaniya-kamma), and there means 'depriving him of his right to eat and dwell with the other Bhikkhus.' Sambhoge anāpatti at Mahāvagga I, 79, 2 (at the end), means that it is not an offence for the Bhikkhus to eat and dwell together with a guilty Bhikkhu under certain conditions there specified. As an Upāsaka never, under any circumstances, either eats or dwells together with the Bhikkhus (in Pā<i>k</i>ittiya 5 the reference is to sāma<i>n</i>eras), the meaning here must be to make him one who has no dealings with the Saŋgha, to withdraw his privilege of providing food or lodging for the Saŋgha. The sabho<i>g</i>ana<i>m</i> kula<i>m</i> in the 43rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya has probably nothing to do with this.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n193" href="#fn193">193</a>]</sup> When a Bhikkhu behaves towards the laity in any one of the first five of these eight ways the Pa<i>t</i>isāra<i>n</i>iya-kamma is to be carried out against him--that is to say, he has to ask pardon of the layman against whom he has offended. See I, 20. The whole eight recur below, § 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n194" href="#fn194">194</a>]</sup> Literally, 'on that very spot.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n195" href="#fn195">195</a>]</sup> This is precisely the expression made use of in the converse case, when a Bhikkhu has offended against the laity. See I, 22, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n199" href="#fn19">199</a>]</sup> The following paragraphs are precisely the same as those in which the revocation of the Ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniya-kamma is described in the reverse case of a Bhikkhu, above, I, 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n200" href="#fn200">200</a>]</sup> Eka<i>m</i>sa<i>m</i> uttarāsa&#7749;ga<i>m</i> karitvā. Unless these words have been introduced by mistake from the corresponding passage in I, 8 (which is not probable), they show that the uttarāsa&#7749;ga (on which see the note on Mahāvagga VIII, 13, 4) was also worn by laymen. But this is the only passage known to us in the earlier literature in which such a use of it is mentioned or implied. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the 'Book of the Great Decease,' VI, 26.</p>

But it is clear that the meal afterwards taken in it by the Buddha was supposed to be the dedication, so to say, or the house-warming, after which it was a<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āvuttho.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n205" href="#fn205">205</a>]</sup> On this habit of naming people after the family or tribal (not the personal) name of their mothers, see Rh. D.'s note in his Buddhist Suttas,' p. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n206" href="#fn206">206</a>]</sup> So far this conversation is the stock phrase for a message from a royal personage to the Buddha. See 'Book of the Great Decease,' I, 2 (Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 2).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n207" href="#fn207">207</a>]</sup> Sopāna-kali&#7749;garā. Compare the Sanskrit Ka<i>d</i>a&#7749;kara (also written ka<i>d</i>a&#7749;gara). The correct reading is doubtless <i>l</i>, not l.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n208" href="#fn208">208</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>ela-pattikā ti <i>k</i>ela-santhara<i>m</i>, says Buddhaghosa. See pa<i>t</i><i>t</i>ikā in Childers, and compare pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a-pa<i>t</i><i>th</i>ika<i>m</i> at V, 11, 6. <i>K</i>ela is not merely ordinary cloth; it is cloth regarded as a means of giving a decorative or festive appearance to a house by spreading canopies, &amp;c. See <i>G</i>ātaka I, 178, and Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 26 (p. 64). On such festive occasions the whole house (or the Ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>apa erected in special honour of the guest) is covered with lengths of clean cotton cloth--the same as are otherwise used for ordinary apparel--white being the colour signifying peculiar respect. It is such lengths of cloth so used honoris causā that are called <i>k</i>ela-pattikā. Compare Rh. D.'s note in 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 122.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n211" href="#fn211">211</a>]</sup> There is no mention in the text of where the first such Portion (Bhā<i>n</i>avāra) ends. There is also no division into Bhā<i>n</i>avāras in the previous books of the <i>K</i>ullavagga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n212" href="#fn212">212</a>]</sup> Gha<i>t</i>aka<i>m</i>. At <i>G</i>ātaka I, 32 this word seems to mean the capital of a pillar. We have taken it as the diminutive of gha<i>t</i>a, especially as Buddhaghosa says nothing; but this is doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n213" href="#fn213">213</a>]</sup> Kataka<i>m</i>. To the note quoted at p. 318 of the text, which shows that this is a kind of foot-rubber, Buddhaghosa adds that this article is forbidden bāhulikānuyogattā. This injunction is repeated below at V, 37, where kataka is mentioned as a kind of earthenware.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n214" href="#fn214">214</a>]</sup> Sakkharā and ka<i>th</i>ala, the exact distinction between which two terms is not stated.</p>

By this name are designated the bones of the cuttle-fish which, when cast up by the waves on the sea-shore, are not unlike petrified foam, and have actually been introduced from the East into use in Europe as a kind of rough natural soap; and are now sold for that purpose in most chemists' shops in England (compare Meerschaum). The same word is found in later Sanskrit works.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n217" href="#fn217">217</a>]</sup> Probably because this, like a white umbrella, was considered an appanage of royalty.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n218" href="#fn218">218</a>]</sup> Mora-pi<i>ñ</i><i>kh</i>a. This word is spelt pi<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>a by Childers, and by Fausb&ouml;ll, <i>G</i>ātaka I, 38, 207.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n219" href="#fn21">219</a>]</sup> See the note at the end of the chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n220" href="#fn220">220</a>]</sup> There is an ambiguity, either in the use of the word <i>kh</i>atta, or in the use of the verb dhāreti, or both, running through this chapter. As a matter of fact, the Bhikkhus now use sun-shades (usually those made of paper in China) of the same shape as the umbrellas now used in England; and they make no distinction as to the place in which they use them. But there is another shape for shades, to be carried by a dependant walking behind the person to be shaded, in which the handle is fastened to the rim at the side of, and not in the middle underneath that part of it which <a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> actually keeps off the sun. Both kinds are figured on the most ancient Buddhist sculptures. The Old Commentary on the corresponding rule for the nuns (Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya LXXXIV, 2, 1) says that suit-shades are either white, or made of matting, or made of leaves (doubtless of the talipot palm); and it adds that they are either ma<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala-baddha<i>m</i> or salāka-baddha<i>m</i>, which apparently refers to these two ways in which the handle was joined on to the shading-part. In the 57th Sekhiya (compare also the 23rd and the 67th), and in <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 1, 1, will be found rules of etiquette which show that it was a sign of courtesy or of respect to put down a sun-shade.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n279" href="#fn279">279</a>]</sup> That is held round by the arm, and resting against the side of the hips. Women in India commonly carry their children so, the children sitting on the hip, with one leg in front and one behind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n280" href="#fn280">280</a>]</sup> Danta-ka<i>t</i><i>th</i>am, not 'tooth-brushes,' as Childers translates. Mechanical skill had not advanced so far in those days; and we hear nothing of brushes of any kind (see above, V, 2, 3, as to hair-dressing). The 'tooth-sticks' were bits of sweet-smelling wood or root, or creeper (see <i>G</i>ātaka I, 80; Mahāva<i>m</i>sa, p. 23), the ends of which were to be masticated as a dentifrice, not rubbed on the teeth. After using them the mouth was rinsed out with water; and so in all other passages in the Khandhakas where they are mentioned (always in reference to the duty of providing them), it is in connection with the bringing of water for that purpose.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n281" href="#fn281">281</a>]</sup> This has of course nothing to do with keeping the teeth white and beautiful; that was not the purpose which the tooth-sticks were designed to effect. There seems to have been really some idea that the use of them was good for the eye-sight. So Buddhaghosa says here, a<i>k</i>akkhussan ti <i>k</i>akkh&ucirc;na<i>m</i> hita<i>m</i> ma hoti, parihā<i>n</i>i<i>m</i> <i>g</i>aneti, quite in accordance with the Sanskrit <i>k</i>akshushya.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n287" href="#fn287">287</a>]</sup> Yame<i>l</i>utekulā. It is possible that this compound should be dissolved into Yame<i>l</i>a and Utekula. Compare the word Yame<i>l</i>e at verse 35 of the Uddāna (which stands where a nominative should stand, judging by the form of the other words in the Uddāna). A comma has there been omitted by misprint after Yame<i>l</i>e.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n288" href="#fn288">288</a>]</sup> We think that in these words (<i>kh</i>andaso āropema) there does lie a reference to the earlier Sanskrit. And this especially for four reasons: firstly, this is required by the antithesis to 'their own dialect;' secondly, the use of the word <i>kh</i>andasi in Pā<i>n</i>ini, where it always means precisely 'in the Veda-dialect,' requires it; thirdly, it is difficult to understand otherwise the mention of 'Brāhmans by birth;' and fourthly, this is in accordance with the traditional interpretation of the passage handed down among the Bhikkhus. Buddhaghosa says, <i>kh</i>andaso āropemā ti Veda<i>m</i> viya sakka<i>t</i>a-bhāsāya vā<i>k</i>anā-magga<i>m</i> āropema. Sakka<i>t</i>a is of course Sa<i>m</i>sk<i>ri</i>ta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n291" href="#fn291">291</a>]</sup> This is mentioned also in the Assalāyana Sutta (at the beginning), and in the same terms in the Milinda Pa<i>n</i>ha, p. 10, as one of the branches of learning distinctive of well-educated Brāhmans. It is condemned among other 'low arts' in the very ancient Mahā S&icirc;la, § 5. (See Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli; p. 199, and his note on the age of this work, ibid. p. 188.) Among later works, the Nepalese Buddhists refer to it as one of the things with which a Bodhisattva will not condescend to occupy himself (Lotus of the Good Law, ch. xiii, Burnouf's version, p. 168), and in which good disciples will take no pleasure (ibid. p. 280). Buddhaghosa has a note on the passage in the Mahā Sib. (quoted by Childers sub voce), which shows that it was understood in his time to be, or rather to have been, a system of casuistry.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n292" href="#fn292">292</a>]</sup> So also in the <i>K</i>etokhila Sutta 2 (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' p. 223).</p>

These are set out in full in the seven sections of the Mahā S&icirc;la (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' pp. 196-200). As noticed above, the Lokāyata system is there mentioned (§ 5) as one of them. Learning or teaching these things are forbidden in almost identical terms to the Bhikkhun&icirc;s in the Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas XLIX and L.</p>
