					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Vi<i>ññ</i>u. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says, 'a man able to understand what is well said, and what is wrongly said; what is wicked, and what is not wicked.' Compare the use of vi<i>ññ</i>utā at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 231.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> To do so when it was not the case, would be a Pārā<i>g</i>ika. See the 4th Pārā<i>g</i>ika, and our note there on the meaning of uttarimanussa-dhamma<i>m</i>. The 'even' here means that the truth of the averment makes no excuse for it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Because doing so might bring some living thing into danger.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Vihesake; which must be understood as being done in a formal meeting of the Saŋgha during an official enquiry.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> That is, according to the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, the rule does not apply to an invalid, or to one suffering from the heat, or the cold; and so on.</p>

This rule, directed against too great luxury in the matter of a perfectly finished dwelling, is somewhat obscure, owing to our want of information as to the mode in which such dwellings should be put up. It refers probably to a hut, albeit a large one, of wattel and daub (ku<i>dd</i>a: comp. Rh. D.'s note on the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta V, 41). The Samanta-Pāsādikā divides dvāra-kosa into dvāra-okāsa, and quotes various estimates from the old Sinhalese commentaries as to the proper extent of this space (see Minayeff, p. 87).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Ovadeyya; that is, shall preach to them the eight Garu-dhammā. On these see the passages mentioned in the Index appended to the text of the <i>K</i>ullavagga; and on the ovāda see <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 9, 2, and fonowing. The mode of procedure is laid down in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga as follows: 'The Bhikkhu asks the Bhikkhunî's, "Are you all present, sisters, and do none raise objections (that is, are you samaggā)?" If they say, "That is so Sir!" he asks, "Are the eight Garu-dhammā being kept up?" If they say, "They are, Sir!" he is to say, "That, sisters, is the exhortation! " and so deliver it to them. If they say, "They are not, Sir!" he should go all through them, saying, "A sister who has been received into the higher grade even one hundred years, &amp;c. (and so on to the end of the Garu-dhammā)."</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'If he preach any other Dhamma to those who say. "We, Sir, are all present, and none raise objections!" he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a. If he preach the eight Garu-dhammā to those who say, "No, Sir; that is not so!" (vagg'amh' ayyā ti. where vagga is vyagra, the opposite of samagga), he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a. If he preach another Dhamma, when the eight Garu-dhammā have not committed to their charge, he is guilty of a Dukka<i>t</i>a.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> āmisa-hetu; that is, in order that the sisters may be induced to supply the preachers with food, medicine, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The introductory story in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga is of a Bhikkhu born in Rāgagaha, who went to a relative's house, and a meal was there being prepared for him by his relatives. A kulupikā bhikkhuhî then arrives, and says, 'My friends, give the gentleman a meal!' Then the Bhikkhu was in doubt whether he ought not to refuse it as being Bhikkhunî-paripā<i>k</i>ita<i>m</i>.</p>

At some of these a constant supply of rice was provided for travellers. See the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta I, 10; II, 5 (pp. 10, 16); <i>G</i>ātaka, No. 31 (' Buddbist Birth Stories,' pp. 280-285); Mabā-sudassana Sutta I, 63; Dhammapada Commentary apud Fausböll, 185. The Samanta-Pāsādikā on this rule (Minayeff, p. 88) says that āvasatha-pindo is a meal in such an āvasatha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> On this rule compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VII, 3, 13. 'In a body' means four or more Bhikkhus going together to the same house.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Mabā-samayo. Tbe Vibha<u>n</u>ga relates how, when vassa was over, the Bhikkhus repaired in great numbers to visit the Buddha. On such occasions it was difficult or impossible for them all, if they adhered to the strict rule, to obtain their meals.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Sama<i>n</i>a-bhatta-samayo. See the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, and the Samanta-Pāsādikā, quoted by Minayeff, pp. 88, 89. ' Sama<i>n</i>as,' of course, includes others besides Buddhists.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Parampara-bho<i>g</i>ane; that is, in picking and choosing with regard to food, or in regard to different invitations. The Bhikkhus were to eat straight on whatever was given, and to accept invitations in the order in which they were received. But a sick Bhikkhu might choose one morsel rather than another; and Bhikkhus in bealth might accept an invitation to a house where robes are going to be given, or made, rather than to a house where only a meal was offered. The last exception was simply to guard against the stock of robes falling short (Bhikkhu . . . nādhivāsenti: <i>k</i>ivara<i>m</i> paritta<i>m</i> uppa<i>gg</i>ati, says the Vibha<u>n</u>ga).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> In the text read dvittipattapurā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The word for sweetmeats, pûva, includes all those sweetmeats which it was then (as it is now) the custom to send as presents from one house to another at weddings, funerals, and such occasions.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'Cakes' (mantha) refers to those rice-cakes, &amp;c., which were usually prepared as provision for a journey. Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 80.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">'Should offer to take as much as he chose' is the phrase referred to above in our note on the 11th Nissaggiya. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says here, Abhiha<i>t</i>u<i>m</i> pavāreyyā 'ti yāvataka<i>m</i> i<i>kkh</i>asi tāvataka<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hāhîti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Pavārito. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says, Pavārito nāma āsana<i>m</i> pa<i>ññ</i>āyati bho<i>g</i>ana<i>m</i> pa<i>ññ</i>āyati hatthapāse <i>th</i>ito abhiharati pa<i>t</i>ikkhepo pa<i>ññ</i>āyati; which means, we think, 'A seat for him is there, food is there, (the host) standing near him still makes invitation, but there takes place a refusal (of the proferred food).'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Khādeyya vā bhu<i>ñg</i>eyya vā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> The 'not left over' refers only to the case of a sick Bhikkhu. A Bhikkhu in health, when he has once finished his meal, ought not to eat what he has left.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Khādaniya<i>m</i> vā bho<i>g</i>aniya<i>m</i> vā. The former term is used of hard food, such as biscuits, cakes, meats, fruits, &amp;c.; the latter term of soft foods, such as boiled rice, curries, &amp;c. The two words for eating correspond to these two ideas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Bhuttasmi<i>m</i> pā<i>k</i>ittiya; that is, the offence is completed when the eating has taken place; but the offer alone is not a Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. So the Vibha<u>n</u>ga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> After sun-turn.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> In the text read tāni; madhu phā<i>n</i>ita<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> Dantapona; doubtless the same, perhaps an older expression for, the danta ka<i>tth</i>a referred to in <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 31. It is a piece of fragrant root (cinnamon, betel, &amp;c.) about eight inches long.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> These are the various non-Buddhist religious teachers or devotees, most of whom rejected the Vedas. The Paribbā<i>g</i>akas were mostly, though not always, wandering logicians, willing to maintain theses against all the world. Paribbā<i>g</i>ikā is merely the feminine of the last. A<i>k</i>elaka, which naturally has no feminine, were the naked ascetics.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The sect now called <i>G</i>ains are divided into two classes, Svetambaras and Digambaras, the latter of which eat naked. They are known to be the successors of the school called Niga<i>nth</i>as in the Pāli Pi<i>t</i>akas; and it is not certain whether the Niga<i>nth</i>as are included in the A<i>k</i>elakas. It is probable that the Brāhman ascetics, the Vānaprasthas, were not included under the term Paribbā<i>g</i>akas; but our information on the exact meaning of these terms is, as yet, very imperfect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> That is merely to get rid of him, in order to gain any purpose of his own. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga gives as examples that the Bhikkhu sees some valuable things, and wants to get them; or sees some woman, and wants to speak to her.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Sabho<i>g</i>ane kule; the meaning ofwhich is notquite clear. The Old Commentary says, 'A sabho<i>g</i>ana kula is one where there is a husband and a wife; and they both, husband and wife, are not gone forth from, are not devoid of lust' (Minayeff, p. 89, under P.; but for anatikkantā read anikkhantā). Then the Samanta-Pāsādikā, doubtless to justify this suggested implication, makes sabhogana<i>m</i> equal to saha ubhohi <i>g</i>anehi (!); or, in the alternative, to sabhoga<i>m,</i> since 'the wife is the bhoga of a man still given to passion, and the husband the bhoga of a wife.' The use of Bho<i>g</i>ana in any such sense is extremely forced, and was perhaps only suggested by the following rules; but it is just possible we should translate, 'a household still given to pleasure' (compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 1), or 'fond of good food' (compare Milinda Pañha 76).</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On anupakhagga compare the 16th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Compare the 30th Pākittiya, and the two Aniyatā Dhammā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> The Vibha<u>n</u>ga has the following stories in regard to these two particulars. A family devated to Upananda invited him and another Bhikkhu. Before meal-time he went to attend on other families (purebhatta<i>m</i> kulāni payirupāsati). The people delayed giving his meal to the other Bhikkhu till Upananda should arrive. He came late; and the other Bhikkhu was thereby discomforted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The family devoted to Upananda sent him food for his use; saying it was to be given to the Saŋgha, with special reference to him. He had gone for an alms to the village. The messengers delivered the food and the message, and asked where Upananda was. The Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One. He directed the present to be accepted, and laid by till Upananda should return. After Upananda returned, he nevertheless went out again to attend on other families, and the food so sent went bad.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Bhikkhu is to tell a resident Bhikkhu before, on account of this rule, giving up his usual rounds, in order that he may still go if a sick Bhikkhu wants medicine.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The exceptions are, as above, to prevent the stock of robes falling short.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> These are usually four — clothing, food, residence, and medicine. This rule refers more especially to medicine, as appears from the explanation in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> On this rule compare the third section of the Ma<i>ggh</i>ima-Sîla, and the third section of the Mahā-Sîla (translated in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' pp. 192, 198 {sic. p. 196 or 197}). We follow the Vibha<u>n</u>ga in the interpretation of the various terms.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> The Old Commentary (quoted by Minareff, p. 90) distinguishes between surā and meraya by the former being derived from flour, water, &amp;c., and the latter from flowers, fruits, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Throwing water over one another, and chasing one another, were common amusements at the public and private bathing-places. Our MSS. read throughout hāsa-dhamme.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Anādarire. That is, according to the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, paying no heed, when one's attention is drawn by an upasampanna to the fact that this or that action is against the rule laid down (pa<i>ññ</i>atta<i>m</i>). But compare also <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 8, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> In the text read bhi<i>m</i>sāpeyya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> H. O.'s MS. reads visibbanāpekho. At Mahāvagga I, 20, 15, visibbesu<i>m</i> occurs in the sense of they warmed themselves.' Trenckner at p. 47 of the Milinda Pa<i>ñ</i>ha reads aggi<i>m</i> galetvā visîvetvā; and at p. 102, sa<i>m</i>sibbitavisibbitattā sākhāna<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> The Vibha<u>n</u>ga refers the first of these periods to the hot weather, and the second to the fever weather.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> In the text insert a full stop after kā<i>l</i>asāma<i>m</i> vā. The object of this rule, according to the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, is to enable a Bhikkhu to trace his robe should it get lost by being mixed up with others. Compare the I5th Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says, 'There are two ways of appointment (in making over, vikappanā), promising in the presence, and promising in the absence (of the person to whom the appointment is made). Promise in the presence is by the words, "I make over this robe to you, or to such and such a one (then present)!" Promising in the absence is by the words, "I give this robe to you for you to appoint (to some one else)." Then the person spoken to should say, "Who is your friend, or intimate acquaintance?" "Such a one, or such a one." Then the other should say, "I give this to them. This is their property. Wear it, or part with it, or do with it as you like!"'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">These last are the formal words used on presenting a robe; and by their use the property in the robe is transferred. After that the original owner, in spite of the formal words, may not, according to our rule, continue to use the robe.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">On apa<i>kk</i>uddhāraka<i>m</i> see Childers, sub voce pa<i>kk</i>uddhāro.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> In the text read sû<i>k</i>ighara<i>m</i>.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Compare the 79th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 14 passim.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> That is, a Pārā<i>g</i>ika, or a Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> The upa<i>ggh</i>āya is guilty of a Pā<i>k</i>ittiya; the ā<i>k</i>ariya, and the ga<i>n</i>a, of a Dukka<i>t</i>a, says the Vibha<u>n</u>ga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Compare the 27th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. A caravan that sets out with intent to steal or rob on the way is meant.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Compare the 27th and 28th Pā<i>k</i>ittiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> These are specified in detail in Mahāvagga II, 3, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Pariyāya; fullness, extent, of illustration and explanation. Not merely manner, or method, of statement. Much of this pariyāya will be found in the various similes used in the <i>K</i>ullavagga loc. cit.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> In the text here, and in the çorresponding clause of No.70, read anekapariyāyena āvuso antarāyikā dhammā antarāyikā vuttā. Bhagavatā, as in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> This rule is directed against the delusion that sin, to a very holy man, loses its danger and its sinfulness. Compare the 4th Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa; and, on the method of procedure here laid down, the 10th to the 13th Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesas. At <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 32 lust is declared to be an antarāyiko dhammo; and falsehood another at Mahāvagga II, 3, 3. The Samanta-Pāsādikā (quoted by Minayeff, p. 92) gives five divisions of these 'dangerous qualities.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> This the Vibha<u>n</u>ga explains as holding Uposatha, or Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, or a Saŋghakamma with him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Ukkhitto anosārito, says the Vibha<u>n</u>ga. Compare Mahāvagga IX, 4, 10, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Sama<i>n</i>uddeso; which is explained by the Old Commentary as equal to Sāma<i>n</i>era. Why, in the Pātimokkha, now one and now the other expression should be used, is not clear. In the later texts Sāma<i>n</i>era is the usual form, but sama<i>n</i>uddeso is found also in a few passages.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> Apadisitabbo. Compare the four Mahāpadesā in the Mahā-parinibbāna. Sutta IV, 7-11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Compare the 5th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> In the text read <i>k</i>ara pi re; that is, <i>k</i>ara api re, instead of <i>k</i>ara pare. On vinassa compare Mahāvagga I, 61, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Upalāpeyya. Compare Mahāvagga I, 59, and Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta I, 5, and the passages quoted in Rh. D.'s version of the latter passage. The Old Commentary says, 'Flatters him (talks him over, tassa upalāpeti) by saying, "I will give you a bowl, or a robe, or hear you repeat, or answer your questions."'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> Upa<i>tth</i>āpeyya. The Old Commentary says, 'by providing him with chunam, or clay, or a tooth-cleanser, or water to wash his face with.' No doubt upa<i>tth</i>āpetî is used in the sense of showing such personal attentions to another, as the upa<i>tth</i>ākā did to the Buddha; and such services would very rightly come under this rule. Yet here, as often, the comment is rather a scholastic exegesis of the sentence, than a philologically exact explanation of the word.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> This title is taken from the second, not, as in all the other cases, from the first rule in the section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> On this strange allocution see the note to the 10th Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Khuddānukhuddakehi. Compare the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 3, and the passages quoted there in Rh. D.'s note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> In the text read viva<i>nn</i>ake.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> In the text read ko pana vādo bhiyyo.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> In the text read a<i>ññ</i>ā<i>n</i>akena.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> Talasattika<i>m</i> uggireyya. The Old Commentary says, Kāya<i>m</i> vā kāyap<i>t</i>ibaddha<i>m</i> vā antamaso uppalapatta<i>m</i> pi u<i>kk</i>āreti. Compare āvudhāni uggiritvā at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 150.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> If he should raise any formal objections so as to re-open the question, that would fall under the 63rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. On 'declaring one's consent' in this and the following rule, see below, Mahāvagga II, 23. The whole rule, as well as on No. 63, is repeatedly referred to in <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> Samaggena sa<i>m</i>ghena. See the note to the 21st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> Indakhîla, the word translated 'threshould,' is explained in the Old Commentary by sayani-ghara, 'sleeping chamber;' but this is rather a didactic gloss on the rule. Compare the note above on the 43rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. The phrase 'when the queen has not gone in' is somewhat doubtful. H. O.'s MS. of the Vibha<u>n</u>ga reads (as Minayeff does) aniggata-ratanake, instead of Dickson's anîhata-ratanake. The former is the better reading; nîhata is impossible, it must be either nihata or nîha<i>t</i>a. But ratanaka, though the queen is one of the seven Ratanas of a king, is not found elsewhere used absolutely for a queen: the use of rā<i>g</i>ake, too, immediately after ra<i>ññ</i>o, instead of ra<i>ññ</i>e or rā<i>g</i>ini, is curious. A possible alternative rendering would be 'when the court has not departed, and the regalia not laid aside:' but we prefer on the whole the Old Commentator's explanation of rā.gaka and ratanaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> Ratanasammata<i>m</i>; that is, a thing made of one of those substances ranked with gems, such as jade, coral, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> Vikāle; that is, says the Old Commentary, from sun-turn in one day till sun-rise in the next.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> Santa<i>m</i> bhikkhu<i>m</i>. If one is not present, he may go without. The Old Commentary gives no such delinition of being present, as Mr. Dickson has supplied.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> A<i>kk</i>āyika. Compare the note on the 28th Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Sugata<u>n</u>gulena. See the note on the 6th Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> A<i>t</i>ani. There is no explanation of this term, either in the Old Commentary, or in the Samanta-Pāsādikā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> Tûla<i>m</i>; which the Old Commentary expands into three kinds--tûla<i>m</i> from a tree, tûla<i>m</i> from a creeper, and tûla<i>m</i> from a young fowl.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> When a Bhikkhu had a boil, or running sore, or any such disease, the use of an itch-cloth (so called from the first in the list of skin complaints there mentioned) is laid down in Mahāvagga VIII, 17.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> On the doubtful meaning of Sugata, see the note above on the 28th Nissaggiya. There is no reason whatever to believe that Gotama's robe was larger, in proportion, than those worn by the other members of his order. He exchanged robes with Mahā Kassapa. Of the two sets of robes brought by Pukkusa, one was given to ānanda, and one was reserved for the Buddha himself; and no one can read the account in the Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta without feeling that both are supposed to be of the same size.</p>
