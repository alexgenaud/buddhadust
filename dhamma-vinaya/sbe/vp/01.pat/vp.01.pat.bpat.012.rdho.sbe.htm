					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Parima<i>n</i><i>d</i>ala<i>m</i>: ' so as to cover the navel-ma<i>nd</i>ala, and the knee-ma<i>nd</i>ala,' says the Old Commentary. Compare Childers sub voce Tima<i>nd</i>ala<i>m</i>; and <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Antaraghare. The antaraghara<i>m</i> is the space in a village between the huts; not exactly the same, and yet in the following rules practically the same, as the village (<i>g</i>&#257;ma).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Not, for instance, with dirty hands or feet, according to the Vibha<u>n</u>ga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The practical rule is for a Bhikkhu to look at a spot in the ground about a plough's length in front of him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Or perhaps 'thrown off.' He is to be fully dressed as laid down in the 1st and 2nd Sekhiyas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> Nakkhambhakato: 'putting the hands on the hips,' says the Old Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Na ogu<i>nth</i>ito : which the Old Commentary applies to the head.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Na ukku<i>t</i>ik&#257;ya; an unusual sense of the word; but it is so explained here by the Old Commentary.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> Na pallatthik&#257;ya. 'Without making a rest with his hands, or with a cloth,' according to the Old Commentary. Compare the Tipallattha-miga <i>G</i>&#257;taka, and No. 65 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Sakka<i>kk</i>a<i>m</i>. Sati<i>m</i> upa<i>tth</i>&#257;petv&#257;, says the Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;. See also No. 31.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Samasûpaka<i>m</i>. 'When the curry is in quantity one-fourth of the rice' explains the Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;. See No. 34.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> Samatittika<i>m</i>. 'Equally full, equally heaped up (samabh&#257;rita<i>m</i>) , explains the Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;. Compare the several passages quoted in Rh. D.'s note on Tevi<i>gg</i>a Sutta I, 24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Sapad&#257;na<i>m</i>. See Childers sub voce. The Vibha<u>n</u>ga says, <i>Kh</i>abbaggiy&#257; bhikkhu taha<i>m</i> taha<i>m</i> omadditv&#257; pi<i>nd</i>ap&#257;ta<i>m</i> bhu<i>ñg</i>anti. The Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257; says, Sapad&#257;nan ti tattha tattha odhi<i>m</i> akatv&#257; anupa<i>t</i>ip&#257;<i>t</i>iy&#257;.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Na thûpato omadditv&#257;; on which the Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dika has 'matthakato vema<i>ggh</i>ato ti.' He is not to pick and choose what morsel he takes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Compare the 8th Nissaggiya. In the text read up&#257;d&#257;ya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Pi<i>nd</i>ukkhepakan ti pi<i>nd</i>a<i>m</i> ukkhipitv&#257; ukkhipitv&#257;, says the Samanta-P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> That is, to disengage particles of the rice, to shake them off on to the ground.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Literally, without making the sound '<i>K</i>apu-<i>k</i>apu.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Literally, without making the sound 'Suru-suru.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Antaraghare, which here means the space, or small open square in the middle of the house.</p>
