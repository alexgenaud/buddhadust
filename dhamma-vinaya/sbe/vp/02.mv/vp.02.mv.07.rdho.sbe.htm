					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> Now at that time the Blessed One was staying at Sāvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anāthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove. And at that time about thirty Pā<i>th</i>eyyaka Bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, <a id="pg147"><span class="f2 g"><b>[147]</b></span></a> who were all dwellers in the forest, all living on alms, all dressed in rags from the dust heap, all having only three robes each, when they were on the way to Sāvatthi to visit the Blessed One, at the time when the period for entering upon Vassa was at hand, were unable to reach Sāvatthi in time to spend the Vassa there, and stayed at Sāketa on the way for the Vassa. And they spent the period of Vassa in discomfort, thinking, 'Our Blessed One is staying near us, six leagues from here, and we are not able to visit the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when, after three months, those Bhikkhus had completed their Vassa residence, and had held their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, they went on to the place where the Blessed One was, at Sāvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anāthapi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's Grove, while the rain was falling, and the waters were gathering<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, and the swamps were forming, and their robes were all drenched, and they were weary. And when they had arrived, they saluted the Blessed One, and took their seats on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas to greet kindly Bhikkhus who have just arrived. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4">Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhus? Do <a id="pg148"><span class="f2 g"><b>[148]</b></span></a> you get enough to support yourselves with? Have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and have you not suffered from want of food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Things go well with us, Lord; we get enough to support ourselves with, Lord; we have kept Vassa, Lord, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and have not suffered from want of food. When we were on our way, Lord, about thirty Pā<i>th</i>eyyaka Bhikkhus, to Sāvatthi to visit the Blessed One, we were unable to reach Sāvatthi in time (&amp;c., as in § 1, down to:). And when, after three months, Lord, we had completed our Vassa residence, and had held our Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, we have made our way, while the rain was falling, and the waters were gathering, and the swamps were forming; and our robes were all drenched; and we have become weary.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Then the Blessed One in that connection, having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg149"><span class="f2 g"><b>[149]</b></span></a> 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony shall be performed by Bhikkhus when <a id="pg150"><span class="f2 g"><b>[150]</b></span></a> they have completed their Vassa. And five things are allowable to you, O Bhikkhus, after the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony has been held--going for alms to the houses of people who have not invited you<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>, going <a id="pg151"><span class="f2 g"><b>[151]</b></span></a> for alms without wearing the usual set of three robes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>, going for alms in a body of four or more<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>, possessing as many robes as are wanted<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>, and whatever number of robes shall have come to hand, that shall belong to them (that is, to the Bhikkhus entitled, by residence and otherwise, to share in the distribution <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>).</p>

					<p class="f4">'And thus, O Bhikkhus, is the Ka<i>th</i>ina to be dedicated.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> 'Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim <a id="pg152"><span class="f2 g"><b>[152]</b></span></a> the following <i>ñ</i>atti before the Saŋgha: "This Ka<i>th</i>ina-cloth has become the property of the Saŋgha. If the Saŋgha is ready, let the Saŋgha hand over the Ka<i>th</i>ina-cloth to such and such a Bhikkhu to spread out the Ka<i>th</i>ina. This is the <i>ñ</i>atti. Let the Saŋgha, reverend Sirs, hear me. This Ka<i>th</i>ina-cloth has become the property of the Saŋgha. The Saŋgha hands it over to such and such a Bhikkhu to spread out the Ka<i>th</i>ina. If the Saŋgha approves of the handing over of the Ka<i>th</i>ina to such and such a Bhikkhu for spreading it out, let it remain silent. The Saŋgha approves thereof. Therefore does it remain silent. Thus I understand<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>."</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Pā<i>th</i>eyya (the Berlin MS. reads Pāveyya) is the name of a kingdom situated to the west of the Kosala country. This passage refers to Bhikkhus who dwelt there. The Bhattavaggiya Theras (so the Berlin MS.; query Satta-vaggiya), who were brothers of the Kosala king, sons of the same father, are here alluded to.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">But with which of the many kingdoms 'to the west of the Kosala country' are we to identify Pā<i>th</i>eyya? The word does not occur in the stock list, found in different parts of the Pāli Pi.itakas, of the sixteen Mahā-<i>g</i>anapadā; that is to say, A&#7749;ga, Magadha, Kāsi, Kosala, Va<i>g</i><i>g</i>i, Malla, <i>K</i>etiya, Va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a, Kuru, Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>āla, Ma<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a, S&ucirc;rasena, Assaka, Avanti, Gandhāra, Kambo<i>g</i>a. The account of the Council at Vesāl&icirc; gives us a hint as to the right answer to the above question; for the Thera Sambh&ucirc;ta, who took part in that Council, is called a Pā<i>th</i>eyyaka in <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 2, 7, and is also said at <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 8 to have lived Ahoga&#7749;ge Pabbate. The position of this hill is further described in the Mahāva<i>m</i>sa as being on the upper Ganges--uddhaga&#7749;gāya . . . . Ahoga&#7749;gamhi pabbate (p. 39, ed. Turnour). Then again in <i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 7 the Thera Yasa, when wishing to put himself in communication with the Bhikkhus in Pā<i>th</i>eyya and in other places, goes to Kosamb&icirc; as the most convenient meeting-place for Bhikkhus coming from the East. The other places mentioned in that passage in juxta-position with Pā<i>th</i>eyya would seem to show that Pā<i>th</i>eyya, with Pā<i>k</i>&icirc;na, Avanti, and Dakkhi<i>n</i>āpatha, is one of the principal divisions into which India, as then known, was divided; and that it includes most, if not all, of the great westerly kingdoms of Kuru, Pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>āla, &amp;c., which are the last eight of the sixteen kingdoms in the stock list above referred to. Probably the literal meaning of Pā<i>th</i>eyya is 'western' (Sans. pratya<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>). In the Suttavibha&#7749;ga (Pā<i>k</i>ittiya 34) merchants are mentioned who are travelling from Rā<i>g</i>agaha to the Pa<i>t</i>iyāloka, which must mean 'the western country,' just as Pa<i>t</i>iyārāma (D&icirc;pav. 17, 11) means 'the western &Acirc;rāma.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Compare IV, I, 8, and foll.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> As has been remarked in a previous note (to the first Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiya Rule) some of the details of these Ka<i>th</i>ina ordinances are at present difficult to understand. But the general meaning of them is already clear. Immediately after the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, the ceremony by which the Vassa residence is closed, there follows a distribution of the robes belonging to the local Saŋgha, (that is, the portion of the Order dwelling within one boundary,) to the particular Bhikkhus composing the Saŋgha. This distribution commences with the ka<i>th</i>in-atthāra, atthāra, 'spreading out,' not being used here literally for spreading out on the ground or otherwise, but in a secondary, juristic sense. And the act performed receives the technical name atthāra by a process of putting a part for the whole, the spreading out in the sun (see our note, p. 18) for the whole ceremony. We translate the term according to the context, sometimes by 'spreading out,' sometimes by 'ceremony,' sometimes by 'dedication.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The Ka<i>th</i>ina, literally 'hard,' is the stock of cotton cloth provided by the faithful to be made up into robes for the use of the Saŋgha during the ensuing year. The whole of this cotton cloth must be dyed, sewn together, and made into robes, and then formally declared to be (not only common property, Sa<i>m</i>ghika, but) available for immediate distribution--all on one and the same day. The object of this was that the Saŋgha, or at least a quorum of the Saŋgha, being able to be present throughout, there would be less chance of any mistake by which what was intended equally for all might come to be unequally divided among a few. All the Brethren who have kept their Vassa within the limits of the district within which the particular Saŋgha lives (and therefore technically called an āvāsa, 'residence'), and who have taken part in the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, are entitled to share in the distribution.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">(Buddhaghosa says, 'Ettha kathinatthāra<i>m</i> ke labhanti ke na labhanti. Ga<i>n</i>avasena tāva pa<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ima-ko<i>t</i>iyā pa<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>a <i>g</i>anā (for at least five must be present to make a Pavāra<i>n</i>ā legal, Mahāvagga IX, 4, r) . . . . vu<i>t</i><i>th</i>avassavasena purimikāya vassa<i>m</i> upagantvā pa<i>th</i>ama-pavāra<i>n</i>āya pavāritā labhanti.')</p>

					<p class="lgqt">There can of course be no ka<i>th</i>in-atthāra if there is no ka<i>th</i>ina; and, under certain restrictions laid down in the Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiya Rules, laymen were allowed to give robes for the special use of a particular Bhikkhu. If, however, a layman was desirous of giving the much more meritorious gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina to the whole community, then he is to present the cloth in the early morning to a properly constituted meeting of the Saŋgha, and the Ka<i>th</i>ina ceremony has to be gone through. All the Brethren living within the boundary have to be present, and to take part in the work of making the cotton cloth up into robes; and if there is any danger of the work not being concluded before the day is over, even the most senior Bhikkhus, or the most revered for their learning or insight, must lend a hand. Then follows the distribution so far only as is set forth in the next section (§ 4) and in the note to it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Now it would often happen that, at the end of the rainy season of Vassa, the last year's robes of some of the Bhikkhus would be worn out. And yet no laymen would come forward to give a Ka<i>th</i>ina until some time after the Vassa residence had closed. But if any one did offer a Ka<i>th</i>ina, and the ceremony was duly performed, then each Bhikkhu had a right to supply his actual needs from the robes made out of the Ka<i>th</i>ina. He need not do so at once. His want might not be pressing, or might not even arise till afterwards. During such an interval the five privileges (Anisa<i>m</i>sā) mentioned in this section (§ 3) are accorded to the Bhikkhus, though they would be against the rules in force during the rest of the year.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">But if the Bhikkhu kept on postponing his choice would the privileges accorded by this section hold good even during the whole year? Could the Bhikkhu, by his mere abstention, thus bring about a practical abrogation of the general rules? Not so, for the five privileges are in their turn suspended by any one of the eight things mentioned below in § 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">We may add that at the present time in Burma and Ceylon, the robes for the Bhikkhus are usually provided in accordance with the rules regulating gifts to particular Bhikkhus. But the gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina is still by no means uncommon. See Spence Hardy's 'Eastern Monachism,' pp. 121 and foll. There is probably, however, very seldom any necessity for the Bhikkhus to avail themselves of any of the five privileges, except the last.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> This privilege is one of the exceptions allowed, in the Pātimokkha, to the 46th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. Bhikkhus were allowed, as a general rule, to pass through a village, with their alms-bowls in their hands, in order to give any disciple who wished to do so the opportunity of giving them food. (To describe this procedure by our word 'begging,' as is so often done, is, to say the least, misleading.) The 46th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya lays down, in certain circumstances, a restriction on this general rule. The present section removes that restriction during the period of Ka<i>th</i>in-atthāra; in order, according to Buddhaghosa (see the note on Pā<i>k</i>. 46), to prevent the stock of robes falling short. That is, apparently, with the hope that a freer intercourse than usual between Bhikkhus and laity might lead to a gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina when it was urgently required.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Here Buddhaghosa says simply, 'Anāmanta-<i>k</i>āro &#8217;ti yāva ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> na uddhariyati tāva anāmantetvā: &Acirc;manteti must be equal to āpu<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ati. Compare B&ouml;htlingk-Roth under āmantra<i>n</i>a.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> This privilege is granted as a relaxation of the 2nd Nissaggiya. Buddhaghosa says, 'Asamādāna-<i>k</i>āro &#8217;ti ti-<i>k</i>ivara<i>m</i> asamādāya <i>k</i>ara<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> <i>k</i>&icirc;vara-vippavāso kappissat&icirc;ti attho.' Compare Mahāvagga VIII, 23, 3. It will be seen that the wording of the Pātimokkha Rule is not inconsistent with the rule laid down here.</p>
					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> This is a relaxation of the 32nd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and is mentioned in that rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This would seem to be a relaxation of the 1st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya. Though it is not referred to there in terms, it is implied in the clause by which the operation of the rule is postponed till after the Ka<i>th</i>ina has been 'taken up,' i.e. till each Bhikkhu has actually received his share, or otherwise lost his claim to it. Till that has taken place, a Bhikkhu may use (temporarily, and without actually appropriating them) as many robes as he likes. B. says, 'Yāvadattha-<i>k</i>&icirc;varan ti yāvatā <i>k</i>ivarena attho tāvataka<i>m</i> anadhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ita<i>m</i> avikappita<i>m</i> (compare Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga Niss. I, 3, 1) kappissat&icirc;ti attho:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> That is, according to Buddhaghosa, either those belonging to a Bhikkhu who has died, or those belonging to the Saŋgha in any way. This shows that at the division not only the robes made out of the gift of a Ka<i>th</i>ina were to be included, but whatever robes had not been given as intended specially for some one Bhikkhu. As to the actual practice now in Ceylon, compare Spence Hardy, loc. cit. Buddhaghosa says here: 'Yo <i>k</i>a tattha <i>k</i>&icirc;var-uppādo tattha ka<i>th</i>inatthata-s&icirc;māya mataka-<i>k</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> vā hotu sa<i>m</i>gha<i>m</i> uddissa dinna<i>m</i> vā sa<i>m</i>ghikena tatr&#8217; uppādena ābhata<i>m</i> vā yena kena<i>k</i>i ākārena yam sa<i>m</i>ghika<i>m</i> <i>k</i>&icirc;vara<i>m</i> uppa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati ta<i>m</i> tesa<i>m</i> bhavissat&icirc;ti attho.' The use of the pronoun nesa<i>m</i> at the end of the rule is awkward, following after vo; but the meaning as translated is not open to doubt.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> This formula is one of those included in the collection entitled Kammavā<i>k</i>a<i>m</i>. It appears from Minayeff (Prātimoksha, pp. 75, 76) that the Bhikkhu so appointed superintends the processes of dyeing, sewing, &amp;c. When the new robes are ready for wear, he lays aside one of his old robes which has been worn out (pa<i>k</i>.uddharitvā), and chooses for himself one of the new ones (nava<i>m</i> adhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ahitvā), saying as he does so, 'imāya sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>iyā (or, as the case may be, uttarāsa&#7749;gena, antaravāsakena) ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> attharāmi.' This speech shows the technical application of the verb attharati in this connection. He then points out the remaining robes to the Bhikkhus there present, specifying which he thinks fit for the elder, and which for the younger members of the Order (Theras and Navakas); but not assigning further any particular robes to particular Bhikkhus. Finally he calls upon the Saŋgha for their formal approval of his procedure (compare the closing words of §§5, 6). But when they have given it, the distribution is not at an end. The time has only come when each of the Bhikkhus can transmute his claim to an undivided share into the actual possession of a divided share. Until he does so, the Ka<i>th</i>ina privileges set out in § 3 are allowed to him.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The formal permission to each Bhikkhu to take his share is not completed by any one of the following acts having been performed. The technical terms of the tailor's craft are, as will be seen, by no means easy to follow.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Or perhaps, according to some commentators, when it has been decided to accept the gift as a Ka<i>th</i>ina, that is, when it has been decided that the cloth is of a suitable kind to make robes out of. Buddhaghosa says: Nimitta-katenā &#8217;ti iminā dussena ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> attharissām&icirc;ti eva<i>m</i> nimittakatena. Ettakam eva Parivāre vutta<i>m</i>.

Compare below, § 6, for this and the two following words, the meaning of which is very doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: Parikathā-katenā &#8217;ti ka<i>th</i>ina<i>m</i> nāma dātum va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati, ka<i>th</i>ina-dāyako bahu-pu<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> pasavat&icirc;ti eva<i>m</i> parikathāya uppāditena.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa simply says: kukku-katenā &#8217;ti tāvakālikena. The last word means 'only for a time, temporary, on loan;' see <i>G</i>ātaka I, 121, 393, and <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 16, 1; but the explanation is not clear. According to the Abhidhāna-ppad&icirc;pikā kukku is a measure of length.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> The discussion of these eight grounds of the suspension of the five Ka<i>th</i>ina privileges is closely connected with the description in the 13th chapter of the two so-called Palibodhas. Palibodha seems to mean the continued existence of a claim on the Bhikkhu's side to a share in the distribution of the Ka<i>th</i>ina. Two conditions are necessary to the validity of this claim; the first touching the Bhikkhu's domicile (āvāsa), the second the state of his wardrobe (<i>k</i>&icirc;vara). He must remain within the boundary (s&icirc;mā) of the Saŋgha to whom the Ka<i>th</i>ina has been given; or if he has left it, then he must have the intention of returning, the animus revertendi. And secondly, he must be in actual want of robes. If either of these conditions fail, then the Bhikkhu is apalibodha in respect of the āvāsa or the <i>k</i>&icirc;vara respectively. If he is apalibodha in both respects, then there follows the suspension of the Ka<i>th</i>ina privileges, the ka<i>th</i>in-uddhāra, or ka<i>th</i>in-ubbhāra, so far as he is concerned.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">So the eight grounds of the suspension of the privileges referred to in our present section (chap. 1. 7) either refer to the Bhikkhu's domicile or to the state of his robes, or to ways in which his case falls within the general suspension of privileges of the whole Saŋgha, Each of the eight cases is explained in detail in the following sections, except the sixth ground, which is specially treated of afterwards in chapters 8 and 9. See the note on the title at the end of this chapter, and compare further our note on the first Nissaggiya Pā<i>k</i>ittiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> Literally, 'whose Ka<i>th</i>ina has been spread out.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> In the table of contents (b. 266) sambhu<i>n</i>āti is replaced by sambhoti. Abhisambhu<i>n</i>eyya<i>m</i> occurs in Burnouf's 'Lotus,' &amp;c., p. 313.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> That is, 'the seven cases in which he takes a robe away.' The eighth case is explained below in chapters 8, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> This chapter is word for word identical with chap. 2: only instead of 'takes' (ādāya) read 'takes with him' (samādāya). We cannot say what different meaning these two words are intended to convey.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> That is, 'the seven cases in which he takes a robe with him.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Six of the seven cases specified in chap. 2 (with the exception of the first of the seven) are repeated here in the same words, with the only difference that instead of 'takes a robe' it is said here 'takes a robe not ready.' The first case is necessarily omitted, because it is essential to that case, that the Bhikkhu going away takes with him a robe ready for wear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> 'The six cases in which he takes a robe away.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> As in chap. 4. For 'takes' read 'takes with him.' See the note at chap. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> 'The six cases in which he takes a robe with him.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> This case is word for word identical with the second case in chap. 2. 1. After it follow the third and fourth case of chap. 2. 1, which it is unnecessary to print here again in full extent. The triad of these cases is repeated here in order to serve as a basis for the variations which are to follow in §§ 2, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The triad of § 1 is repeated here, with the difference, as is seen from the opening clauses which we have fully printed, that the Bhikkhu, before he has got beyond the boundary, and not afterwards as in § 1, resolves upon not returning to the āvāsa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> The whole triad as in § 1. The only difference between § 3 and § 1 consists in the following words being added in § 3 in each of the three cases, 'without taking a resolution; he neither thinks "I will come back," nor does he think "I will not come back."'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Supply here the whole triad as in § 1, the words 'thinking "I will come back"' being constantly added. After this triad follow three other cases which are exactly identical with the three contained in chap. 2. 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> The whole chapter 6 is repeated here three times, the first time replacing the words 'takes a robe' by 'takes a robe with him' (comp. chap. 3); the second time replacing 'takes a robe' by 'takes a robe not ready' (comp. chap. 4); and the third time with these two modifications combined (comp. chap. 5).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> §§ 2, 3 stand exactly in the same relation to § 1 in which chap. 6. 2, 3 stand to chap. 6. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> 'The twelve cases (in which the robe is received) against expectation.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Here follows the same development into the four cases of ni<i>t</i><i>th</i>ānantika, sanni<i>t</i><i>th</i>ānantika, nāsanantika, and āsāva<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edika ka<i>th</i>inuddhāra, as in chap. 8. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Supply here the same four cases as in the preceding paragraph or in chap. 8. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> 'The twelve cases (in which the robe is received) as expected.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> See chap. 8. 1. The same three times four cases are specified here as in chap. 8; only the opening clauses of each case, which we have printed above, are different from those in chap. 8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> 'The twelve cases of (the Bhikkhu's going away on) business.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> Comp. II, 21, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> Apa<i>k</i>inayamāna, comp. apa<i>k</i>iti; apa<i>k</i>ita.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Here follow the three cases as given in chap. 6. 1, in the usual way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> The usual three cases; see the preceding note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> The same three cases as before.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> 'The nine cases in which he guards (his claim).'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> The usual three cases as before, and then the two cases of the s&icirc;mātikkantika ka<i>th</i>inuddhāra and the saha bhikkh&ucirc;hi ka<i>th</i>inuddhāra, which run as may be seen from chap. 2. 2 (the two last cases there) or from chap. 9. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Literally, there are two Palibodhas of the Ka<i>th</i>ina and two Apalibodhas. On the subject discussed in this chapter--the Palibodhas--see the note on chap. 1. 7.</p>
