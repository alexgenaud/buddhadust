					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at <i>K</i>ampā, on the brink of the lotus-pond Gaggarā. At that time there was in the country of Kāsi (a village) called Vāsabha-gāma. There a Bhikkhu called Kassapa-gotta had his residence, who was bound (to that place) by the string (of the religious duties which he had to perform there<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>), and who exerted himself to the end that clever Bhikkhus from a distance might come to that place, and the clever Bhikkhus therein might live at ease, and that (religious life at that residence might progress, advance, and reach a high state.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time a number of Bhikkhus, making their pilgrimage in the country of Kāsi, came to Vāsabha-gāma. And the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta saw those Bhikkhus coming from afar; when he saw them, he prepared seats for them, brought water for the washing of their feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then he went forth to meet them, took their bowls and their robes, offered them (water) to drink, and provided a bath for them, and provided also rice-milk and food hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg257"><span class="f2 g"><b>[257]</b></span></a> Now those stranger Bhikkhus thought: 'The resident Bhikkhu here, O friends, is indeed good-natured; he provides a bath for us and provides also rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. What if we were to stay here, friends, at Vāsabha-gāma.' Thus those stranger Bhikkhus stayed there at Vāsabha-gāma.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Now the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta thought: 'These stranger Bhikkhus are rested now from their travel-weariness; they did not know their way here before, but now they know their way. It is troublesome indeed to be busy all one's life for people not related to one's self, and being asked<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> is disagreeable to men. What if I were to provide no longer rice-milk, and food, hard and soft (for those Bhikkhus).' Thus he did not provide any more (for them) rice-milk, and food, hard and soft.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those stranger Bhikkhus thought: 'Formerly, friends, this resident Bhikkhu used to provide baths for us, and to provide also rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. But now he does not provide any more rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. This resident Bhikkhu, friends, is in anger with us now. Well, friends, let us pronounce expulsion against this resident Bhikkhu.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Then those stranger Bhikkhus assembled and said to the Bhikkhu' Kassapa-gotta: 'Formerly, friend, you used to provide baths for us and to provide also rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. But now you do not provide any more rice-milk, and food, hard and soft. You have committed an offence, friend; do you see that offence?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg258"><span class="f2 g"><b>[258]</b></span></a> 'There is no offence, friends, for me to see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those stranger Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta for his refusal to see that (pretended) offence. Then the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta thought: 'I do not know indeed whether this is an offence or not, and whether I have made myself guilty of an offence or not, and whether I have been expelled or not, and whether that sentence is lawful or unlawful, objectionable or unobjectionable, valid or invalid. What if I were to go to <i>K</i>ampā and to ask the Blessed One about this matter?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> And the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta put his resting-place in order, took up his alms-bowl and his robe, and went forth to <i>K</i>ampā; and in due course he came to <i>K</i>ampā and to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas to exchange greeting with incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta: 'Is it all well with you, O Bhikkhu? Do you find your living? Have you made your journey without too much fatigue? And from what plate do you come, O Bhikkhu?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is all well, Lord; I find my living, Lord; I have made the journey, Lord, without too much fatigue:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> 'There is in the country of Kāsi, Lord, (a village) called Vāsabha-gāma. There I had my residence, Lord, (&amp;c.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>, down to:) Then those <a id="pg259"><span class="f2 g"><b>[259]</b></span></a> stranger Bhikkhus, Lord, pronounced against me expulsion for my refusal to see that offence. Then I thought, Lord: "I do not know indeed whether this is an offence or not, and whether I have made myself guilty of an offence or not, and whether I have been expelled or not, and whether that sentence is lawful or unlawful, objectionable or unobjectionable, valid or invalid. What if I were to go to <i>K</i>ampā and to ask the Blessed One about this matter." Thus I have come here, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.6">1.6</a> (Buddha replied): 'This is no offence, O Bhikkhu; it is not an offence. You are innocent; you are not guilty of an offence. You are not expelled, and have not been expelled; the sentence by which you have been expelled is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid. Go, O Bhikkhu, and settle yourself again at Vāsabha-gāma.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhu Kassapa-gotta expressed his assent to the Blessed One (by saying), 'Yes, Lord,' rose from his seat, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One and walked round him with his right side towards him, he went on his way to Vāsabha-gāma.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.7">1.7</a> Now those stranger Bhikkhus (at Vāsabha-gāma) were overcome by scruples and remorse:</p>

					<p class="f4">It is all loss to us indeed, it is no gain to us; we will fare ill indeed, we will not fare well, in this that we have expelled that pure, guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause and reason. Well, friends, let us go to <i>K</i>ampā and let us confess there in the Blessed One's presence our sin in its sinfulness.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg260"><span class="f2 g"><b>[260]</b></span></a> And those stranger Bhikkhus put their resting-places in order, took up their alms-bowls and their robes, and went forth to <i>K</i>ampā, and in due course they came to <i>K</i>ampā and to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they sat down near him. Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas (&amp;c.<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>, down to:) 'It is all well, Lord; we find our living, Lord; we have made the journey, Lord, without too much fatigue. There is in the country of Kāsi, Lord, (a village) called Vāsabha-gāma; from that place we come, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.8">1.8</a> 'So are you, O Bhikkhus, those who have expelled the resident Bhikkhu there?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'We are, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'For what cause, O Bhikkhus, and for what reason?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Without any cause and reason, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'That is improper, O Bhikkhus, it is unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O fools, expel a pure and guiltless Bhikkhu, without any cause and reason? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, expel a pure and guiltless Bhikkhu without cause and reason. He who does, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.9">1.9</a> Then those Bhikkhus rose from their seats, adjusted their upper robes so as to cover one <a id="pg261"><span class="f2 g"><b>[261]</b></span></a> shoulder, prostrated themselves, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Transgression, O Lord, has overcome us like the foolish, like the erring, like the unhappy, in this that we have expelled a pure, guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause and reason. May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept (the confession of) our sin in its sinfulness, and we will refrain from it in future.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Truly, O Bhikkhus, transgression has overcome you like the foolish, like the erring, like the unhappy, in that you have expelled a pure, guiltless Bhikkhu without any cause and reason. But as you see, O Bhikkhus, your sin in its sinfulness, and duly make amends for it, we accept it from you. For this, O Bhikkhus, is called progress in the discipline of the noble one, if one sees his sin in its sinfulness, and duly makes amends for it, and refrains from it in future.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> At that time the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampā performed official acts in the following ways: they performed unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed unlawful acts before a complete congregation; they performed lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before an incomplete congregation; they performed seemingly lawful acts before a complete congregation; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a single one; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against two; a single Bhikkhu <a id="pg262"><span class="f2 g"><b>[262]</b></span></a> pronounced expulsion against a number of Bhikkhus; a single Bhikkhu pronounced expulsion against a Saṅgha; two Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . . against a number of Bhikkhus . . . . against a Saṅgha; a number of Bhikkhus pronounced expulsion against a single one . . . . against two . . . . against another number . . . . against a Saṅgha; a Saṅgha pronounced expulsion against another Saṅgha<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p><a id="p2.2">2.2</a> Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampā perform official acts in the following ways: perform unlawful acts before an incomplete congregation (&amp;c., down to:) how can a Saṅgha pronounce expulsion against another Saṅgha?'</p>

					<p class="f4">These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, as they say, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus of <i>K</i>ampā perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing; it is unbecoming, indecent, unworthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, perform official acts in the following ways, &amp;c. This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted.' Having thus rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

An official act performed unlawfully by a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed (&amp;c., as in §1, down to:). A seemingly lawful act performed before a complete congregation is no real act and ought not to be performed.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.4">2.4</a> 'There are, O Bhikkhus, four kinds of official acts (which a Saṅgha can perform); an unlawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, an unlawful act performed by a complete congregation, a lawful act performed by an incomplete congregation, and a lawful act performed by a complete congregation.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Here the different categories of forbidden acts are enumerated one after the other, as in §1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> About <i>ñ</i>atti, kammavā<i>k</i>ā, <i>ñ</i>attidutiya, and <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha acts, see our note at I, 28, 3. 'Proposing a <i>ñ</i>atti' and 'proclaiming a kammavā<i>k</i>ā' mean proposing a motion and putting a resolution to the assembled brethren. </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> See II, 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> The identical three cases given before with regard to the <i>ñ</i>attidutiya act are repeated here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> The six cases given in this paragraph, of which three refer to <i>ñ</i>attidutiya acts and three to <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha acts, differ from those specified in §5 only by the statement added in each of these cases regarding the inverted order of <i>ñ</i>atti and kammavā<i>k</i>ā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> This paragraph stands precisely in the same relation to §6 in which the preceding one stands to §5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga III, 2 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> As regards the exceptional regulations referring to the upasampadā ordination in the bordering countries, see above, V, 13, 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Here follows the very frequent enumeration given, for instance, at II, 36, §§1-4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Generally speaking, the two categories of 'persons belonging to another communion,' and 'persons staying within another boundary,' can be considered as coincident. In certain cases, however, they could be distinguished; see X, 1, §§9, 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Here the enumeration of §2 is repeated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> See about parivāsa, and the other Saṅghakammas referred to in this paragraph, the details given in the second book of the <i>K</i>ullavagga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> But has not yet been conferred. An abbhita Bhikkhu is considered as fully rehabilitated.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Against official acts which the Saṅgha is performing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> This list of persons who cannot protest against official acts of the Saṅgha differs from that given in §2 or at II, 36, §§1-4, only by three categories being here added after 'a person guilty of an extreme offence' (antimavatthu<i>m</i> a<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āpannaka). These categories are the following: 'a madman,' 'a person whose mind is unhinged,' 'a person who suffers (bodily) pain.' See II, 22, 3, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> That is, the Saṅgha which is going to perform the act in question.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> See the note at §2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> Compare the rules regarding the pabbā<i>g</i>aniyakamma, <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 13 seq., and our note at I, 79, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> Anapadāna. Buddhaghosa: 'Anapadāno &#8217;ti apa<i>t</i>āna-(read apadāna-) virahito. apadāna<i>m</i> vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati pari<i>k</i><i>kh</i>edo. āpatti-pari<i>k</i><i>kh</i>eda-virahito &#8217;ti attho.' Probably the word must not be derived from the root dā, 'to give,' but from dā, 'to cut.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> See the list of persons given at II, 36, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> The formality and the repetitions are the same here as in §20, and need not be repeated. The list of persons whose restoration is stated to be valid is the same as at I, 71, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> The ukkhepaniyakamma āpattiyā appa<i>t</i>inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to atone for an offence) is spoken of here exactly in the same terms as those in which the ukkhepaniyakamma āpattiyā adassane (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to see an offence) is spoken of in the preceding clause. The brethren say to the pretended offender, 'You have committed an offence, friend; atone for that offence'--which he refuses to do.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> As above; the Bhikkhus institute the ukkhepaniyakamma pāpikāya di<i>t</i><i>th</i>iyā appa<i>t</i>inissagge (expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to renounce a false doctrine).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> As in §2, the first and second of the three cases given in §1 are combined, so follow now combinations of the first and third, the second and third, and of the first, second, and third cases respectively.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Here follow again the cases of the ukkhepaniyakamma āpattiyā appa<i>t</i>inissagge and pāpikāya di<i>t</i><i>th</i>iyā appa<i>t</i>inissagge, and the combinations of the three cases as above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> Here follow the two other cases, together with the combinations of the three, exactly as above.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> That the redactors of this Pi<i>t</i>aka have chosen Upāli here and at X, 6, <i>K</i>ullavagga II, 2, 7, to question the Blessed One about the Vinaya regulations, stands evidently in connection with the tradition ascribing to Upāli an especial authority regarding the rules of the Order and styling him, as is said in the D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa (IV, 3, 5; V, 7,. 9), agganikkhittaka, i.e. original depositary, of the Vinaya tradition. See our Introduction, p. xii seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 4, 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga IV, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> This Saṅghakamma and the following ones are explained in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> For this term and the next ones, see <i>K</i>ullavagga III, 1-9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> The Saṅghakammas enumerated in §2, beginning with sativinaya, are arranged here in pairs, in direct and reverse order, in this way: sativinaya and am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya, am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya and sativinaya; then am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya and tassapāpiyyasikākamma, tassapāpiyyasikākamma and am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> The same dyads as in §5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> In this paragraph all possible combinations of two different Saṅghakammas are formed in this way: first, sativinaya is combined with am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya and all the rest, down to upasampadā; then am&ucirc;<i>lh</i>avinaya with all terms from tassapāpiyyasikā down to sativinaya, and so on; the whole series ends thus with the combinations of upasampadāraha with all terms from sativinaya down to abbhāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> As in §1, but with a different arrangement of the five categories on which this exposition is based: unlawfully with an incomplete congregation, unlawfully with a complete congregation, lawfully with an incomplete congregation, seemingly lawfully with an incomplete congregation, seemingly lawfully with a complete congregation. In §1 these categories are arranged in their natural order; in §2 the second is placed at the head, then follow the third, fourth, fifth, and finally the first; in §3 the exposition likewise begins with the third and ends with the second, &amp;c. This arrangement is called 'a wheel' (<i>k</i>akka).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> See the note at chap. 4, §9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 9-12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> The same five cases and the same kakka as in §§1-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> See the 13th Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa Rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 13-17.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> As in §§1-5 or in §6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 18-24.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> §10: A Bhikkhu, having committed an offence, refuses to atone for that offence. §11: A Bhikkhu refuses to renounce a false doctrine.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> §10: For his refusal to atone for that offence. §11: For his refusal to renounce that false doctrine.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> The analogous five cases with the kakka development as in §§1-5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> As in §§12, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> The text treats here in §§17, 18 of the nissayakamma (see §6) and of the Saṅghakammas down to the expulsion for a Bhikkhu's refusal to renounce a false doctrine (see §§7-11) in the same manner as the ta<i>g</i><i>g</i>aniyakamma is spoken of in §§15, 16. Then follows (§§19, 20) an exactly analogous exposition about the revocation of these Saṅghakammas, which stands in the same relation to §§15-18 in which §§12-14 stand to §§1-11.</p>
