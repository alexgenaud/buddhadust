					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:1">1.</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Sāvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, the garden of Anāthapi<i>nd</i>ika. At that time a number of Bhikkhus, companions and friends of each other, entered upon Vassa in a certain district of the Kosala country. Now those Bhikkhus thought: 'What shall we do in order that we may keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and that we may not suffer from want of food?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:2">2.</a> Then those Bhikkhus thought: 'If we do not speak to or converse with each other, if he who comes back first from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, prepares seats, gets water for washing the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel<a id="page_325_fr_1"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, cleans the slop-basin and gets it ready, and puts there (water to) drink and food,--</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:3">3.</a> 'And if he who comes back last from the village, from his alms-pilgrimage, eats, if there is any food left (from the dinner of the other Bhikkhus) and if he desires to do so; and if he does not desire (to eat), throws it away at a place free from grass, or pours it away into water in which no living things are; puts away the water for washing the feet, the foot-stool, and the towel<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>; cleans the slop-basin and <a id="page_326"><span class="f1 g">p. 326</span></a> puts it away, puts the water and the food away, and sweeps the dining-room,--</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:4">4.</a> 'And if he, who sees a water-pot, or a bowl for food, or a vessel for evacuations, empty and void, puts it (into its proper place), and if he is not able to do so single-handed, calls some one else and puts it away with their united effort<a id="page_326_fr_1"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> without uttering a word on that account,--thus shall we keep Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and not suffer from want of food<a id="page_326_fr_2"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:5"></a>5-7. And those Bhikkhus did not speak to or converse with each other. He who came back from the village from his alms-pilgrimage first, prepared seats (&amp;c., as above, § 4, down to) without uttering a word on that account.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:8">8.</a> Now it is the custom of the Bhikkhus who have finished their Vassa residence, to go to see the Blessed One. Thus those Bhikkhus, when they had finished their Vassa residence and when the three months (of Vassa) had elapsed, set their places of rest in order, took their alms-bowls and robes, and went on their way to Sāvatthi. Wandering from place to place, they came to Sāvatthi, to the <i>G</i>etavana, the garden of Anāthapi<i>nd</i>ika, to the Blessed One; having approached the Blessed One and respectfully saluted him, they sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:9">9.</a> Now it is the custom of the blessed Buddhas <a id="page_327"><span class="f1 g">p. 327</span></a> to exchange greeting with incoming Bhikkhus. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus: 'Do things go well with you, O Bhikkhus? Do you get enough to support yourselves with? Have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel? and have you not suffered from want of food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Things go tolerably well with us, Lord; we get enough, Lord, wherewith to support ourselves; we have kept Vassa well, in unity, in concord, and without quarrel; and have not suffered from want of food.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:10">10.</a> The Tathāgatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tathāgatas put questions full of sense, not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the Tathāgatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions to the Bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the doctrine. or when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:11">11.</a> And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus: 'In what way, O Bhikkhus, have you kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel, and not suffered from want of food?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'We have entered upon Vassa, Lord, a number of Bhikkhus, companions and friends of each other. in a certain district of the Kosala country. Now, Lord, we thought: "What shall we do (&amp;c., as in § 1)?" Then we thought, Lord: "If we do not speak (&amp;c., as in §§ 2-4)." Thus, Lord, we did not speak to or converse with each other (&amp;c., down to:) without uttering a word on that account. In that <a id="page_328"><span class="f1 g">p. 328</span></a> way, Lord, we have kept Vassa well, in unity, and in concord, and without quarrel; and have not suffered from want of food.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:12">12.</a> Then the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Indeed, O Bhikkhus, these foolish men who profess to have kept Vassa well, have kept it badly; indeed, O Bhikkhus, these foolish men who profess to have kept Vassa well, have kept it like a herd of cattle; indeed have kept it like a herd of rams; indeed have kept it like a company of indolent people. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, take upon themselves the vow of silence, as the Titthiyas do?</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:13">13.</a> 'This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted (&amp;c., as in Book III, chapter 14, § 3).' And when he bad rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, take upon himself the vow of silence, as the Titthiyas do. He who does, I commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that the Bhikkhus, when they have finished their Vassa residence, hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā with each other<a id="page_328_fr_1"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> in these three ways: by what has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected. Hence it will result that you live in accord with each other, that you atone for the offences (you have committed), and that you keep the rules of discipline before your eyes.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:14">14.</a> 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā in this way:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="page_329"><span class="f1 g">p. 329</span></a> 'Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following ñatti before the Saṅgha: "Let the Saṅgha, reverend Sirs, hear me. To-day is the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā day. If the Saṅgha is ready, let the Saṅgha hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then let the senior Bhikkhu adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "I pronounce my Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, friends, before the Saṅgha, by what has been seen, or by what has been heard, or by what is suspected<a id="page_329_fr_1"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>; may you speak to me, Sirs, out of compassion towards me; if I see (an offence), I will atone for it. And for the second time, &amp;c. And for the third time I pronounce my Pavāra<i>n</i>ā (&amp;c., down to) if I see (an offence), I will atone for it."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then let (each) younger Bhikkhu adjust his upper robe . . . . (&amp;c.)<a id="page_329_fr_2"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:1">1.</a> At. that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, while the senior Bhikkhus were crouching down and were performing their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, remained on their seats. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus remain on their seats, while the senior <a id="page_330"><span class="f1 g">p. 330</span></a> Bhikkhus crouch down, and perform their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Those Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, O Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the blessed Buddha rebuked them: 'How can these foolish men, O Bhikkhus, remain on their seats (&amp;c., as above)? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted (&amp;c., as in chap. 1, § 13).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having rebuked them and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, remain on his seat, while the senior Bhikkhus crouch down, and perform their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā. He who does, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a. offence. I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that all of you crouch down while Pavāra<i>n</i>ā is being performed.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:2">2.</a> At that time a certain Bhikkhu weak from age, who waited crouching till all had finished their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, fell down fainting.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that (every Bhikkhu) crouches down the whole while till he has performed his Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, and sits down on his seat when he has performed it.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:1">1.</a> Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'How many Pavāra<i>n</i>ā (days) are there?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are the two following Pavāra<i>n</i>ā (days), <a id="page_331"><span class="f1 g">p. 331</span></a> O Bhikkhus: the fourteenth and the fifteenth (of the half month)<a id="page_331_fr_1"></a><span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>; these are the two Pavāra<i>n</i>ā (days), O Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:2">2.</a> Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'How many Pavāra<i>n</i>ā services are there?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:3">3.</a> Then the Blessed One thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'Assemble, O Bhikkhus, the Saṅgha will hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā.' When he had spoken thus, a certain Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'There is a sick Bhikkhu, Lord, who is not present.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that a sick Bhikkhu shall declare (lit. give) his Pavāra<i>n</i>ā. And let him declare it, O Bhikkhus, in this way: Let that sick Bhikkhu go to some Bhikkhu, adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "I declare my Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, take my Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, perform the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā for me." If he expresses this by gesture, or by word, or by gesture and word, the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā has been declared. If he does not express this by gesture, &amp;c., the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā has not been declared.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 6, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> We are not quite sure of the meaning of the compounds hattha-vikāreha and hattha-vita<u>n</u>ghakena. Buddhaghosa says merely hatthavila<u>n</u>ghakenā 'ti hatthukkhepakena.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> For this whole passage, compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 5, 3. The single actions which these Bhikkhus do, are quite correct, except that they keep silence during the whole time of Vassa, and especially at the end of it, for which time Buddha, on this occasion, prescribes the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā ceremony.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> Literally, invite each other; i.e. every Bhikkhu present invites his companions to tell him if they believe him guilty of an offence, having seen that offence, or having heard of it, or suspecting it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> I.e. I invite the Saṅgha to charge me with any offence they think me guilty of, which they have seen, or heard of, or which they suspect.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> As in the preceding sentence, except that the younger Bhikkhus do not address the Saṅgha,' 'Friends,' but, 'Reverend Sirs.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> Comp. II, 14, 1, and the note on II, 34, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> This passage is exactly identical with II, 14. 2. 3, replacing 'Uposatha service' by 'Pavāra<i>n</i>ā service.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This passage is a repetition of II, 22, 2-4, the words, 'Hold Uposatha,' 'Declare the Pārisuddhi,' &amp;c., being replaced respectively by 'Hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā,' 'Declare the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā,' &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> See II, 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Comp. the finishing clause of II, 23.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> This is a repetition of II, 24, but instead of 'Uposatha' and 'Pārisuddhi' read 'Pavāra<i>n</i>ā.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> As a general rule five Bhikkhus were sufficient to form the quorum; but for the performance of several among the official acts of the Order the presence of more than five members was required; see IX, 4, 1 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup>See IX, 4, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup>See chap. 3, § 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Compare II, chap. 22, and chap. 26, § 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup>See chap. 16, § 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> The following paragraphs and chapters exactly follow the course indicated by II, 28-35. The alterations to be made are obvious and sufficiently indicated by §§ 1-3; instead of, 'Let them proclaim their Pārisuddhi ' (II, 28, 4, &amp;c.), read here, 'Let them pronounce their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> See II, 36, 1-3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Comp. II, 36, 4, with the note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> See, for instance, the cases in chap. 17. Buddhaghosa's explanation is different; he says: 'Concord among the Saṅgha js to be understood of such cases as that of Kosambî,' It is said in the account of the schism of Kosambî that, if concord has been re-established, the reconciled parties hold Uposatha together (X, 5, 14; comp. II, 36, 4); Buddhaghosa apparently extends this to holding Pavāra<i>n</i>ā also.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> This means apparently that the Bhikkhus were not obliged to pronounce the formula of Pavāra<i>n</i>ā (chap. 1, 14) thrice, but twice or once respectively.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Comp. II, 16, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Correct in the Pāli text pariyositāya into apariyositāya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> The paragraph is repeated with the phrases, 'With the twofold formula,' 'with the onefold formula,' and 'by common declaration of all the Bhikkhus who have kept Vassa together,' respectively, instead of 'with the threefold formula.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> As in § 6. But instead of 'Not of a pure conduct in his deeds, nor in his words, nor as regards his means of livelihood,' read respectively, 'Of a pure conduct in his deeds, but not in his words, nor as regards his means of livelihood' (§ 7); 'Of a pure conduct in his deeds and in his words, but not with regard to his means of livelihood' (§ 8); 'Of a pure conduct in his deeds and in his words and with regard to his means of livelihood' (§ 9).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> The meaning of antaggāhikā di<i>tth</i>i (Sanskrit āntargrahikā d<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i? āntagrahikā d<i>ri</i>sh<i>t</i>i?) is unknown to us; Buddhaghosa gives no explanation. Perhaps it may mean doctrine partly false and partly correct (eclectic).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> </p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> See the 5th Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> See the 76th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> According to Buddhaghosa, the Bhikkhu who brings such an unfounded charge against a fellow Bhikkhu, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> 'Because it had not been possible to decide the matter at the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā ' (Buddhaghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> See the 63rd Pā<i>k</i>ittiya rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> In this way, when the inimical Bhikkhus are arriving about the time of Pavāra<i>n</i>ā, the resident Bhikkhus count the day which is the thirteenth or fourteenth to the other Bhikkhus, as the fifteenth, and thus they are enabled to finish their Pavāra<i>n</i>ā before they can be prevented.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> See I, 6, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> As in § 4, down to the end of the paragraph; instead of, 'On the next new-moon day,' it is to be read here, 'On the next full-moon day.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> See the note on III, 14, 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> See the 54th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> Probably we should read in the Pāli text, 'ārogo āroga<i>m</i> āka<u>n</u>khamāno <i>k</i>odessasîti.' Then the translation would be: 'When you have recovered and he has recovered, &amp;c.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> Literally this word means, we believe, 'Keeping back one's own Pavāra<i>n</i>ā,' Buddhaghosa says: 'When the decree of pavāra<i>n</i>āsa<i>m</i>gaha has been issued, the Bhikkhus (who have issued it) ought to live as in the rainy season. Incoming Bhikkhus are not allowed to take possession of their places of rest. On the other side, they ought not to interrupt their Vassa residence.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Here follows the usual formula of a ñattidutiya kamma as in Book ll, chap. 6. Comp. the note on Book I, chap. 28, § 3.</p>
