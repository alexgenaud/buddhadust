					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Rā<i>g</i>agaha at the Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, held rule and sovranty over eighty thousand townships<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>. And at that time there was at <i>K</i>ampā a Se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's son named So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, delicately nurtured, on the soles of whose feet hair had grown.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now when Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, was holding an assembly of the eighty thousand overseers over those townships, he sent a message to So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa on some matter of business, saying, 'Let So<i>n</i>a come hither. I desire So<i>n</i>a's presence!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Then spake the parents of So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa to him thus: 'The king, dear So<i>n</i>a, wishes to see thy feet. But stretch not out thy feet, dear So<i>n</i>a, towards the <a id="pg2"><span class="f2 g"><b>[2]</b></span></a> king. Take thy seat cross-legged before the king, that the king may see thy feet as thou sittest there.' And they carried So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa in a palankeen (to Rā<i>g</i>agaha).</p>

					<p class="f4">And So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa went to the place where Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, was. And when he had come there, and had bowed down before Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, he took his seat cross-legged before the king. And Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, saw that hair had grown on the soles of the feet of So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Now after Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, the king of Magadha, had instructed the eighty thousand overseers over those townships in the things of this world he exhorted them, saying, 'Ye have now received from me instruction in the things of this world. Go now, and wait upon the Blessed One. The Blessed One himself shall instruct you in the things of eternity.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the eighty thousand overseers over those townships went on to the Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> Now at that time the venerable Sāgata was the attendant on the Blessed One. And the eighty thousand overseers over those townships went to the place where the venerable Sāgata was. And when they were come there they spake thus to the venerable Sāgata:</p>

					<p class="f4">The eighty thousand overseers over the townships are come here, Sir, to visit the Blessed One. It were well, Sir, that we should be granted an audience of the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then do you, Sirs, stay here yet a moment, while I let the Blessed One know.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> <a id="pg3"><span class="f2 g"><b>[3]</b></span></a> Then the venerable Sāgata disappeared down the steps<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span> from before the very eyes of the eighty thousand overseers over those townships, and appeared before the Blessed One, and spake to the Blessed One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord, the eighty thousand overseers over the townships are come here to visit the Blessed One. Let the Blessed One do as seemeth to him fit.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Do thou then, Sāgata, make a seat ready in the shade of the house<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.6">1.6</a> 'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Sāgata, in assent, to the Blessed One. And taking a chair, he disappeared from before the Blessed One, and reappeared up the steps before the very eyes of those eighty thousand overseers over those townships, and made ready a seat in the shade of the house.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One came out of the house and sat down on the seat made ready in the shade thereof.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.7">1.7</a> Then those eighty thousand overseers over the townships went up to the place where the Blessed One was. And when they had come there they bowed down before the Blessed One and took their seats on one side. But those eighty thousand overseers over the townships paid more respect in their hearts to the venerable Sāgata than to the Blessed One<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One perceived by his mind the thoughts of the minds of those eighty thousand <a id="pg4"><span class="f2 g"><b>[4]</b></span></a>. overseers over the townships; and he addressed the venerable Sāgata, and said: 'Show them now, Sāgata, a still greater wonder, beyond the power of men.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Lord!' said the venerable Sāgata, in assent, to the Blessed One. And rising up into the air he walked, and stood, and sat, and lay down, and gave forth smoke and fire, and disappeared in the sky.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.8">1.8</a> Then the venerable Sāgata, when he had shown in the open sky wonders of various kinds beyond the power of men, fell down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One; and I am the disciple. My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One; and I am the disciple.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those eighty thousand overseers over the townships thinking, 'Wonderful is it, most marvellous! If even the pupil be so mighty and so powerful, how much more then the master!' paid more respect in their hearts to the Blessed One than to the venerable Sāgata.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.9">1.9</a> Then the Blessed One perceived by his mind the thoughts of the minds of those eighty thousand overseers over the townships, and held to them a discourse in due order; that is to say, he spake to them of giving, of righteousness, of heaven, of the danger, the worthlessness, the depravity of lusts, and of the advantages of renunciation. And when the Blessed One perceived that they had become pliant, softened, unprejudiced, upraised and believing in heart, then he proclaimed that which is the special doctrine of the Buddhas; (that is to say), Suffering, its Origin, its Cessation, and the Path.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg5"><span class="f2 g"><b>[5]</b></span></a> Just as a clean cloth, from which all stain has been washed away, would readily take the dye, just even so did those eighty thousand overseers over the townships obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth; (that is to say, the knowledge that) whatsoever has a beginning, in that is inherent also the necessity of dissolution.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.10">1.10</a> And having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having understood the Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, they said to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord! glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed One preached the doctrine in many ways. We take our refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the fraternity of Bhikkhus; may the Blessed One receive us from this day forth while our life lasts as his disciples who have taken their refuge in Him.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.11">1.11</a> And So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa thought: As I understand the Dhamma proclaimed by the Blessed One, it is not easy to a person living as a layman to lead a wholly perfect and pure and altogether consummate<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> life of holiness. What if I were to cut off my hair and beard, and to put on yellow robes, and give up the world, and go forth into the houseless state.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg6"><span class="f2 g"><b>[6]</b></span></a> And those eighty thousand overseers over the townships, having expressed their joy and delight at the words of the Blessed One, rose from their seats, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and passing round him with their right sides towards him, went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.12">1.12</a> And So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa, soon after those eighty thousand overseers over the townships had departed, went to the place where the Blessed One was. And when he had come there he bowed down before the Blessed One and took his seat on one side. Sitting on one side So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa said to the Blessed One: 'As I understand the Dhamma proclaimed by the Blessed One (&amp;c., as in §11, down to:) and go forth into the houseless state. I desire, Lord, to cut off my hair and beard, and to put on yellow robes, and to give up the world, and to go forth into the houseless state. May the Blessed One, Lord, ordain me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa received from the Blessed One the pabba<i>g</i><i>g</i>ā and upasampadā ordinations. And the venerable So<i>n</i>a, soon after his upasampadā, dwelt in the S&icirc;tavana grove.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.13">1.13</a> As he, with eager determination, was walking up and down there, his feet were injured, and the place in which he walked became covered with blood, like a slaughter-house for oxen. Then in the mind of the venerable So<i>n</i>a, who had gone apart and was plunged in meditation, there sprung up this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Though I have become one of those disciples of the Blessed One who live in the exercise of strenuous determination, yet my heart has not been set free from the &Acirc;savas through absence of craving. And there is much wealth laid up for me at home. It is possible both to enjoy that wealth, and to do good <a id="pg7"><span class="f2 g"><b>[7]</b></span></a> deeds. Let me now, then, returning to the lower state<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span>, enjoy my wealth and do good deeds.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.14">1.14</a> Now the Blessed One perceived in his mind the thought of the heart of the venerable So<i>n</i>a; and as quickly as a strong man can stretch forth his arm, or can draw it back again when it has been stretched forth, he disappeared from the hill of the Vulture's Peak, and appeared in the S&icirc;tavana grove. And the Blessed One, as he was passing through the sleeping-places (of the Bhikkhus), came up, with a multitude of Bhikkhus, to the place where the venerable So<i>n</i>a had walked up and down.</p>

					<p class="f4">When the Blessed One saw that the place where the venerable So<i>n</i>a had walked up and down was covered with blood, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Whose walking-place<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span> is this, O Bhikkhus, which is covered with blood, like a slaughter-house for oxen?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'As the venerable So<i>n</i>a, Lord, was walking up and down here with eager determination, his feet were injured; and so this place has become covered with blood, like a slaughter-house for oxen.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.15">1.15</a> Then the Blessed One went on to the house in which the venerable So<i>n</i>a was living, and sat down there on a seat made ready for him. And the venerable So<i>n</i>a bowed down before the Blessed <a id="pg8"><span class="f2 g"><b>[8]</b></span></a> One, and took his seat on one side. And when he was thus seated, the Blessed One addressed the venerable Soma, and said: 'Is it not true, So<i>n</i>a, that in your mind, when you had gone apart and were plunged in meditation, there sprung up this thought: "Though I have become (&amp;c., as in §13, down to the end)?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Even so, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what think you, So<i>n</i>a,--you were skilled, were you not, when you formerly lived in the world, in the music of the lute?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That was so, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now what think you, So<i>n</i>a,--when the strings of your lute<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span> were too much stretched, had your lute then any sound, was it in a fit state to be played upon?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Not so, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.16">1.16</a> 'Now what think you, So<i>n</i>a,--when the strings of your lute were too loose, had your lute then any sound<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>, was it in a fit state to be played upon?' 'Not so, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now what think you, So<i>n</i>a,--when the strings of your lute were neither too much stretched nor too loose, but fixed in even proportion, had your lute sound then, was it then in a fit state to be played upon?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yes, Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And just so, So<i>n</i>a, does too eager a determination conduce to self-righteousness, and too weak a determination <a id="pg9"><span class="f2 g"><b>[9]</b></span></a> to sloth.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.17">1.17</a> Do thou, therefore, O So<i>n</i>a, be steadfast in evenness of determination, press through to harmony of your mental powers. Let that be the object of your thought<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span>!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Even so, Lord!' said the venerable So<i>n</i>a, and hearkened to the word of the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Blessed One had exhorted the venerable So<i>n</i>a with this exhortation, then, as quickly as a strong man can stretch forth his arm, or can draw it back again when it has been stretched forth, he vanished from the presence of the venerable So<i>n</i>a in the S&icirc;tavana grove, and reappeared on the hill of the Vulture's Peak.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.18">1.18</a> Thenceforward the venerable So<i>n</i>a was stead-fast in evenness of determination, he pressed through to harmony of his mental powers, that did he take as the object of his thought. And the venerable So<i>n</i>a remaining alone and separate, earnest, zealous, and resolved, attained ere long to that supreme goal of the higher life for the sake of which noble youths go out from all and every household gain and comfort to become houseless wanderers--yea, that supreme goal did he, by himself, and while yet in this visible world, bring himself to the knowledge of, and continue to realise, and to see face to face! And he became conscious that rebirth was at an end, that the higher life had been fulfilled, that all that should be done had been accomplished, and that after this present life there would be no beyond!</p>

					<p class="f4"> <a id="pg10"><span class="f2 g"><b>[10]</b></span></a> So the venerable So<i>n</i>a became yet another among the Arahats.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.19">1.19</a> Now when the venerable So<i>n</i>a had attained to Arahatship there occurred to him the thought: 'Let me now make known my Insight in the presence of the Blessed One<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>!'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable So<i>n</i>a went to the place where the Blessed One was, and bowed down before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side. And when he was thus seated, the venerable So<i>n</i>a said to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.20">1.20</a> 'Whatsoever Bhikkhu, Lord, is an Arahat whose &Acirc;savas are rooted out, who has lived the life, who has accomplished the task, who has laid aside every burden, who has gained the end he had in view, who has quite broken the fetter of a craving for (future) existence, who is completely set free by insight, six things doth he reach up unto<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span>--unto renunciation, unto the love of solitude, unto kindness of heart, unto the destruction of craving, unto the destruction of thirst, unto the getting free from delusions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.21">1.21</a> 'Now it may be, Lord, that it might occur, regarding this matter, to some brother, thus: "For the sake of faith merely<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span> hath this brother attained <a id="pg11"><span class="f2 g"><b>[11]</b></span></a> unto renunciation." But not thus, Lord, should this matter be regarded. For the Bhikkhu in whom the &Acirc;savas are rooted out, who has lived the life, who has accomplished the task, he looks not upon himself as one who has anything yet to do, or to gather up, of (the fruit of his past) labour; but he attaineth to renunciation by the destruction of lust, by the very condition of the absence of lust; he attaineth to renunciation by the destruction of ill-will, by the very condition of the absence of ill-will; he attaineth to renunciation by the destruction of delusions, by the very condition of the absence of delusions.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.22">1.22</a> 'Now it may, be, Lord, that it might occur, regarding this matter, to some brother, thus: "Seeking after gain, hospitality, and fame bath this brother attained to the love of solitude." But not thus (&amp;c., as in §21, down to the end, substituting "love of solitude" for "renunciation").</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.23">1.23</a> 'Now it may be, Lord, that it might occur, regarding this matter, to some brother, thus: "Returning, verily, to the dependence upon works, as if that were the true essence (of spiritual welfare), hath this brother attained to kindness of heart." But not thus (&amp;c., as in §21, down to the end, substituting "kindness of heart" for "renunciation").</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.24">1.24</a> 'He attaineth to the destruction of craving by the destruction of lust (&amp;c., as in §21, down to the end, substituting "absence of craving" for "renunciation"). He attaineth to the absence of thirst (&amp;c., as in §21). He attaineth to the absence of delusions (&amp;c., as in §21, down to the end).</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.25">1.25</a> 'When a Bhikkhu, Lord, has thus become fully emancipated in heart, even though many objects <a id="pg12"><span class="f2 g"><b>[12]</b></span></a> visible to the sight should enter the path of his eye<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>, yet they take not possession of his mind: undefiled is his mind, firm, immovable; and he sees into the (manner which that impression) passes away<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span>--even though many objects audible to the ear, smellable to the nostrils, tastable to the tongue, feelable by the body, sensible to the intellect should enter the path of the ear, the nose, the tongue, the skin, the intellect, yet they take not possession of his mind: undefiled is his mind, firm, immovable, and he sees into the (manner in which that impression) passes away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.26">1.26</a> 'Just, Lord, as if there be a mountain of rock, undivided, solid, one mass, and much wind and rain should fall upon it from the direction of the East, or of the West, or of the North, or of the South, yet they would not make it shake, or tremble, or quake; just so, Lord, when a Bhikkhu has thus become fully emancipated in heart (&amp;c., as in §25, down to the end).</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.27">1.27</a> 'He who has attained to renunciation, to solitude of heart, who has attained to kindness, and to the rooting out of craving,</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who has attained to the rooting out of thirst, to the absence of delusions from the mind, he sees the source of sensations, his mind is quite set free.</p>

					<p class="f4">'To such a Bhikkhu, so emancipated, and with calmness in his heart, there is no gathering up of what is done, nothing to be done still remains.</p>

					<p class="f4">'As a rock, all of one mass, is not shaken by <a id="pg13"><span class="f2 g"><b>[13]</b></span></a> the breezes<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>, just so never can shapes and tastes, and sounds, and smells, and touch--the whole of them</p>

					<p class="f4">Things wished for, things unwished--make tremble such a one. Firm is his mind, set free. He sees into the end thereof.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.28">1.28</a> And the Blessed One addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'Thus, brethren, do young men of worth make their insight known. The truth is spoken, and the self is not obtruded. But herein some foolish ones, methinks, make known their insight to be a thing ridiculous, and they, thereafter, fall into defeat!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.29">1.29</a> Then the Blessed One said to the venerable So<i>n</i>a, 'You, So<i>n</i>a, have been delicately nurtured. I enjoin upon you, So<i>n</i>a, the use of shoes with one lining<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">I have gone out from the world, Lord, into the houseless state, abandoning eighty cart-loads of gold<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span>, and a retinue of seven elephants<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>. It will be said against me for this matter: "So<i>n</i>a Ko<i>li</i>visa went out from the world into the houseless state, abandoning eighty cart-loads of gold, and a retinue of seven elephants; but the very same man now accustoms himself to the use of shoes with a lining <a id="pg14"><span class="f2 g"><b>[14]</b></span></a> to them." [30.] If the Blessed One will enjoin their use upon the Order of Bhikkhus, I will also use them. If the Blessed One will not enjoin their use upon the Order of Bhikkhus, neither will I use them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, on that occasion, having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I enjoin upon you, O Bhikkhus, the use of shoes with one lining to them. Doubly lined shoes, Bhikkhus, are not to be worn, nor trebly lined ones, nor shoes with many linings<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span>. Whosoever shall wear such, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus were in the habit of wearing slippers all of a blue, yellow, red, brown, black, orange, or yellowish colour<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span>. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, '(These act) like those who still enjoy the pleasures of the world<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>.' The brethren told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Do not wear, O Bhikkhus, shoes that are all of <a id="pg15"><span class="f2 g"><b>[15]</b></span></a> a blue, yellow, red, brown, black, orange, or yellowish colour. Whosoever does so, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.2">2.2</a> Now at that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus were in the habit of wearing shoes with edges of a blue, yellow, red, brown, black, orange, or yellowish colour.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'But how can you be so foolish as to do so? Have I not censured in many a discourse the taking of life, O foolish one, and praised the abstinence therefrom? Such conduct, thou foolish one, will not conduce to the conversion of the unconverted!'</p>

					<p class="f4">And having thus rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.1">13.1</a> Now at that time the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana was staying in Avanti on the hill called the Precipice, near Kuraraghara<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn66" href="#n66">66</a>]</sup></span>. And at that time the lay-disciple named So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn67" href="#n67">67</a>]</sup></span> was the personal attendant upon the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a went to the place where the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana was, and saluted him, and took his seat beside him. And when he was thus seated, he said to the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana:</p>

					<p class="f4">'As I understand the doctrine laid down by the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana, it is difficult for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection. I wish therefore to cut off my hair and beard, to clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and to go forth from the household life into the houseless state<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn68" href="#n68">68</a>]</sup></span>.

Do you, therefore, So<i>n</i>a, remain in the state of a householder, and practise only for a time the higher life, the precepts of the Buddhas, using only one bed, and with but one meal a day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the desire for renunciation<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn69" href="#n69">69</a>]</sup></span> which had arisen in the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a abated in him.</p>

					<p class="f4">And a third time So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a made the same request. Then the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana conferred the pabba<i>g</i><i>g</i>ā (ordination) on the disciple So<i>n</i>a Ku<i>t</i>ika<i>n</i><i>n</i>a.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time in the Southern country and in Avanti there were but few Bhikkhus.

And then he admitted the venerable So<i>n</i>a into the higher rank of the Order.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.3">13.3</a> Now when the venerable So<i>n</i>a had passed the rainy season there sprang up in his mind, when he was meditating alone, this thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I have heard indeed that the Blessed One is such and such a one. But I have not as yet seen him face to face. I should like to go and visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha, if my superior would allow me.'</p>

And when he was thus seated, he said to the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.4">13.4</a> 'When I was meditating alone, venerable Sir, the following thought occurred to my mind, "I have heard (&amp;c., as above)." Now I would go and visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha, if you, as my superior, allow it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That is good, that is good, So<i>n</i>a! Go then, So<i>n</i>a, to visit the Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.5">13.5</a> You shall see, So<i>n</i>a, how the Blessed One arouses faith, is worthy of faith, calm in his senses, calm in his mind, gifted with the highest self-control and quietude, an elephant among men, subdued, guarded, with his senses in subjection to himself. Do you therefore, Soma, bow down in my name at the feet of the Blessed One, and say, "Lord! my superior, the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana, bows down in salutation at the feet of the Blessed One!" and add, "In the Southern country and in Avanti there are, Lord, but few Bhikkhus. And it was only after the lapse of three years that with difficulty and with trouble an assembly of the Order was got together, in which ten members were present, and I could be received into the higher rank of the Order. May the Blessed One be pleased, therefore, to allow the higher ordination in the Southern country and in Avanti before a meeting of a lesser number.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg35"><span class="f2 g"><b>[35]</b></span></a> May the Blessed One be pleased, therefore, to allow the use, in the Southern country and in Avanti, of shoes with thick linings.

May the Blessed One be pleased to allow, in the Southern country and in Avanti, the constant use of the bath<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn73" href="#n73">73</a>]</sup></span>. In the Southern country and in Avanti, Lord, skins, such as sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins, are used as coverlets. Just as in the Middle country<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn74" href="#n74">74</a>]</sup></span> the eragu, moragu, ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>āru, and <i>g</i>antu grasses<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span> are used for coverlets, so are sheep-skins, goat-skins, and deer-skins in the Southern country and in Avanti. May the Blessed One be pleased to allow the use of such coverlets there.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.7">13.7</a> At present, Lord, people are in the habit of giving a set of robes to Bhikkhus, who have left the district, saying, 'We give this set of robes to (a Bhikkhu) of such and such a name.' When they return, the Bhikkhus tell them, 'A set of robes has been given to you by a person of such and such a name.' But they, fearing to offend, do not accept it, saying, 'Let us not be guilty of a Nissaggiya.' May the Blessed One be pleased to make a detailed statement in the matter of robes."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg36"><span class="f2 g"><b>[36]</b></span></a> 'Even so, Lord,' said the venerable So<i>n</i>a in assent to the venerable Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana, and, rising from his seat, he departed thence, keeping his right side towards him. And taking up his bed, he went on with his robe on, and his bowl in his hand to Sāvatthi.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.8">13.8</a> And wandering from place to place he arrived at the place where the Blessed One was, at Sāvatthi in the <i>G</i>etavana, Anātha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika's park. And when he had come there he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat beside him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'Make ready a sleeping-place, &Acirc;nanda, for this Bhikkhu who has just arrived.' And the venerable &Acirc;nanda thought:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Inasmuch as the Blessed One commands me to make ready a sleeping-place for the Bhikkhu who has just arrived, the Blessed One evidently desires to dwell in the same Vihāra with that Bhikkhu, he desires to dwell in the same Vihāra with the venerable So<i>n</i>a.' And he made ready a sleeping-place for the .venerable So<i>n</i>a at the place where the Blessed One was staying.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.9">13.9</a> Then the Blessed One, after spending the greater part of the night in the open air, entered the Vihāra. And also the venerable So<i>n</i>a, having spent the greater part of the night in the open air, entered the Vihāra. And the Blessed One rose up, early in the morning, towards dawn, and requested the venerable So<i>n</i>a, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Dhamma so become clear to you that you may speak.'<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span></p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg37"><span class="f2 g"><b>[37]</b></span></a> Even so, Lord!' said the venerable So<i>n</i>a in assent to the Blessed One; and he intoned all the verses in the Book of the Eights (A<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka-vaggikāni<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span>).</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, at the conclusion of the venerable So<i>n</i>a's recitation, expressed his pleasure, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'Excellent, most excellent, O Bhikkhu! Well have the Eights been grasped by thee, well thought over, well learnt by heart: and with a fine voice art thou gifted, distinct, pleasant<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span>, able to make things understood. How many years is it since thou hast been ordained?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'One year, my Lord!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.10">13.10</a> 'But why have you postponed it so long?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'&#8217;Tis long, Lord, since I saw into the danger of the passions, but life in a household is crowded with business and with cares.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, when he heard that matter, gave utterance at that time to the expression of emotion:</p>

					<p class="f4">'When he has seen the danger of the world, when he has understood the Truth, when he has become free from Upadhi,<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn79" href="#n79">79</a>]</sup></span> <a id="pg38"><span class="f2 g"><b>[38]</b></span></a> 'The pilgrim finds in sin no pleasure, his delight is in the word, the pure.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p13.11">13.11</a> Then thought the venerable So<i>n</i>a: 'The Blessed One is pleased with me. This then is the time which my superior spoke of.' And rising from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, he bowed down with his head at the feet of the Blessed One, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Lord! my superior Mahā Ka<i>k</i><i>k</i>āyana bows down in salutation at the feet of the Blessed One. In the Southern country and in Avanti there are (&amp;c., as in §§4-7, down to the end of the message).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One on that occasion and in that connection, having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'The Southern country and Avanti has but few Bhikkhus. I allow the upasampadā (ordination) in border countries to be held in a meeting of only four Bhikkhus, beside the chairman, who must be a Vinaya-dhara.'</p>

A very ancient pair of stone va<i>k</i><i>k</i>a-pādukā, forming part of a slab of stone, was discovered at Anurādhapura by Rhys Davids, and is now in the Colombo Museum. As they were dug up in one of the palaces there, they were probably for the use of the king, or some high official.

Childers has given the commentary on most of these terms from the Suma&#7749;gala Vilāsin&icirc;. Several of the items are also mentioned among the possessions of the Great King of Glory (Rh. D., loc. cit., p. 274, &amp;c.). In several cases the exact meaning is at present quite uncertain.
