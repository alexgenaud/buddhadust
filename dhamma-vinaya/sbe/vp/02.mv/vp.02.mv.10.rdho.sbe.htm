					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p1">1.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Kosamb&icirc; in the Ghositārāma.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time a certain Bhikkhu had committed an offence which he considered as an offence, while the other Bhikkhus considered that offence as no offence. Afterwards he began to consider that offence as no offence, and the other Bhikkhus began to consider that offence as an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now those Bhikkhus said to that Bhikkhu: 'You have committed an offence, friend; do you see that offence?'</p>

					<p class="f4">(He replied): 'There is no offence, friends, which I should see.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then those Bhikkhus, bringing about unanimity (of the fraternity for their sentence) pronounced expulsion against that Bhikkhu for his refusal to see that offence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Now that Bhikkhu was erudite; he had studied the Agamas; he knew the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the Mātikā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>; he was wise, learned, intelligent, modest, conscientious, anxious for training.</p>

					<p class="f4">And that Bhikkhu went to his companions and friends among the Bhikkhus, and said to them: 'This is no offence, friends; this is not an offence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg286"><span class="f2 g"><b>[286]</b></span></a> I am offenceless; I am not guilty of an offence; I am unexpelled and, have not been expelled; the sentence by which I have been expelled is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid. May the venerable ones be my partisans according to Dhamma and Vinaya.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that Bhikkhu got his companions and friends among the Bhikkhus on his side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And he sent also a messenger to his companions and friends among the Bhikkhus of the whole country (with the following message): 'This is no offence, friends; this is not an offence (&amp;c., down to:). May the venerable ones be my partisans according to Dhamma and Vinaya.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Thus that Bhikkhu got also his companions and friends among the Bhikkhus of the whole country on his side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Now those Bhikkhus who were partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu, went to the place where those who had expelled him, were. Having approached them, they said to the Bhikkhus who had expelled him: This is no offence, friends; this is not an offence. This Bhikkhu is offenceless; this Bhikkhu is not guilty of an offence. This Bhikkhu is unexpelled; this Bhikkhu has not been expelled. The sentence by which he has been expelled is unlawful, objectionable, and invalid.'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they had spoken thus, the Bhikkhus who had expelled that Bhikkhu, said to the partisans of the expelled one: 'This is an offence, friends; this is not no offence. This Bhikkhu is an offender; this Bhikkhu is not offenceless. This Bhikkhu is expelled; this Bhikkhu is not unexpelled. The sentence by which he has been expelled is lawful, <a id="pg287"><span class="f2 g"><b>[287]</b></span></a> unobjectionable, and valid. Do not stand, O venerable ones, on the side of this expelled Bhikkhu; do not follow him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">But the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu, though they were spoken to thus by the Bhikkhus who had expelled him, persevered nevertheless on the side of that expelled Bhikkhu and followed him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> And a certain Bhikkhu went to the place where the Blessed One was. Having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'A certain Bhikkhu, Lord, had committed an offence which he considered as an offence (&amp;c., as in §§1-3, down to:). But the partisans, Lord, of the expelled Bhikkhu, though they were spoken to thus by the Bhikkhus who had expelled him, persevered nevertheless on the side of that expelled Bhikkhu and followed him.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> Then the Blessed One (exclaimed): 'The Bhikkhu Saŋgha is divided! The Bhikkhu Saŋgha is divided!'--and he rose from his seat and went to the place where the Bhikkhus were who had pronounced that sentence of expulsion. Having approached them, he sat down on the seat they had prepared. Sitting there the Blessed One said to the Bhikkhus who had pronounced expulsion against that Bhikkhu: 'Do not think, O Bhikkhus, that you are to pronounce expulsion against a Bhikkhu whatever be the facts of the case, saying, "It occurs to us to do so; it occurs to us to do so."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.6">1.6</a> 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu has committed an offence which he considers as no offence, while the other Bhikkhus consider it as an offence--if, O Bhikkhus, those Bhikkhus know with regard <a id="pg288"><span class="f2 g"><b>[288]</b></span></a> to that Bhikkhu: "This venerable brother is erudite; he has studied the &Acirc;gamas; he knows the Dhamma, the Vinaya, the Mātikā; he is wise, learned, intelligent, modest, conscientious, anxious for training. Should we pronounce expulsion against this Bhikkhu for his refusal to see that offence, and should we not hold Uposatha with that Bhikkhu, but hold Uposatha without that Bhikkhu, this matter will cause among the Saŋgha altercations, contentions, discord, quarrels, divisions among the Saŋgha, disunion among the Saŋgha, separations among the Saŋgha, schisms among the Saŋgha,"--in that case, O Bhikkhus, let those Bhikkhus, standing in awe of causing divisions, not pronounce expulsion against that Bhikkhu for his refusal to see his offence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.7">1.7</a> 'In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu has committed (&amp;c., as above, down to:). "Should we pronounce expulsion against this Bhikkhu for his refusal to see that offence, and should we not hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā with that Bhikkhu, but hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā without that Bhikkhu, and not perform official acts with that Bhikkhu, but perform official acts without that Bhikkhu, and not sit down on our seats with that Bhikkhu, but sit down on our seats without that Bhikkhu, and not sit down to drink rice-milk with that Bhikkhu, but sit down to drink rice-milk without that Bhikkhu, and not sit down in the dining-hall with that Bhikkhu, but sit down in the dining-hall without that Bhikkhu, and not dwell under one roof with that Bhikkhu, but dwell under one roof without that Bhikkhu, and not perform with that Bhikkhu, according to seniority, the duties of respectfully saluting each other, rising from our seats, raising the joined hands before each other, and all <a id="pg289"><span class="f2 g"><b>[289]</b></span></a> proper duties, but perform without that Bhikkhu, according to seniority, the duties, &amp;c.,--this matter will cause among the Saŋgha (&amp;c., as in §6, down to the end).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.8">1.8</a> And the Blessed One, having spoken thus to the Bhikkhus who had pronounced that sentence of expulsion, rose from his seat, and went to the place where the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu were. Having approached them, he sat down on the seat they had prepared. Sitting there the Blessed One said to the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu: 'Do not think, O Bhikkhus, if you have committed an offence, that you need not atone for that offence, (saying to yourselves): "We are without offence." In case, O Bhikkhus, a Bhikkhu has committed an offence which he considers as no offence, while the other Bhikkhus consider it as an offence--if, O Bhikkhus, that Bhikkhu knows with regard to those Bhikkhus: "These venerable brethren are erudite (&amp;c., down to:) anxious for training. It is impossible that they should, on my account, or on account of anybody else, abandon themselves to walking in longing, in malice, in delusion, in fear. Should these Bhikkhus pronounce expulsion against me for my refusal to see that offence, and should they not hold Uposatha with me, but hold Uposatha without me, and should they not hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā with me, but hold Pavāra<i>n</i>ā without me (&amp;c., as in §7), this matter will cause, &amp;c., schisms among the Saŋgha,"--in that case, O Bhikkhus, let that Bhikkhu, standing in awe of causing divisions, acknowledge that offence on the authority of his brethren<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.' And the <a id="pg290"><span class="f2 g"><b>[290]</b></span></a> Blessed One, having spoken thus to the partisans of the expelled Bhikkhu, rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.9">1.9</a> At that time the Bhikkhus who were partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu, held Uposatha and performed official acts at that same place, within the boundary. On the other hand the Bhikkhus who had pronounced expulsion against him, went outside the boundary and there held Uposatha, and performed official acts.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now a certain Bhikkhu of those who had expelled that Bhikkhu, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. Sitting near him that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, those Bhikkhus who are partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu, hold Uposatha, and perform official acts, at that same place, within the boundary. On the other hand, we who have pronounced expulsion against him, have gone outside the boundary and there hold Uposatha and perform official acts.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(Buddha replied): 'If those Bhikkhus, O Bhikkhu, who are partisans of that expelled Bhikkhu, will hold Uposatha, and perform official acts, at that same place, within the boundary, according to the rules laid down by me about <i>ñ</i>atti and anussāvanā, these official acts which they perform will be lawful, unobjectionable, and valid. And if you, O Bhikkhus, who have expelled that Bhikkhu, will hold Uposatha, and perform official acts, at that same place, within the boundary (&amp;c., down to:) and valid.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.10">1.10</a> 'And why is this so? These Bhikkhus belong to another communion than that to which you <a id="pg291"><span class="f2 g"><b>[291]</b></span></a> belong, and you belong to another communion than that to which they belong.</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are two cases, O Bhikkhu, in which a Bhikkhu (though he dwell within the same boundary) is considered as belonging to another communion:--either he himself makes himself belong to another communion<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, or the Saŋgha in a complete congregation pronounces expulsion against him for his refusal to see (an offence committed by himself), or to atone (for such an offence), or to renounce (a false doctrine). These, O Bhikkhu, are the two cases in which a Bhikkhu is considered as belonging to another communion.</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are two cases, O Bhikkhu, in which a Bhikkhu (belonging to either of the categories mentioned) reacquires the belonging to the same communion (with his brethren within the same boundary); either he himself makes himself belong (again) to that same communion<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>, or the Saŋgha, having expelled him for his refusal to see (an offence), or to atone (for an offence), or to renounce (a false doctrine), restores him in a complete congregation. These, O Bhikkhu, are the two cases in which a Bhikkhu reacquires the belonging to the same communion.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.1">2.1</a> At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels had arisen, in the dining-hall and amidst the houses, behaved <a id="pg292"><span class="f2 g"><b>[292]</b></span></a> improperly towards each other in gesture and word, and came to blows.</p>

					<p class="f4">The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can these Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, when altercations, contentions, and quarrels have arisen among them, &amp;c., and come to blows?' Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the Bhikkhus, when altercations, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.2">2.2</a> These Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having rebuked them, and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'When divisions have arisen among the Saŋgha, O Bhikkhus, and when unlawful conduct and unfriendliness prevail among the Bhikkhus, then you ought to sit down on your seats (separately, saying to yourselves): "At least we will not behave improperly towards each other in gesture or word, and will not come to blows." When divisions have arisen among the Saŋgha, O Bhikkhus, and when lawful conduct' and friendliness prevail among the Bhikkhus, then you may sit down (together), one by one from each side<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Bhikkhus, among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels had arisen, wounded each other with sharp words in the assemblies, and were unable to settle that question.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg293"><span class="f2 g"><b>[293]</b></span></a> Then a certain Bhikkhu went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted him, he stationed himself near him. Standing near him, that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, the Bhikkhus among whom altercations, contentions, and quarrels have arisen, wound each other with sharp words in the assemblies, and are unable to settle that question. Pray, Lord, may the Blessed One go to those Bhikkhus out of compassion towards them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One went to the place where those Bhikkhus were; having approached them, he sat down on the seat they had prepared. Sitting there the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, no altercations, no contentions, no disunion, no quarrel!'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus, a certain Bhikkhu, an adherer of the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, the king of Truth, be patient! Lord, may the Blessed One quietly enjoy the bliss he has obtained already in this life! The responsibility for these altercations and contentions, for this disunion and quarrel will rest with us alone.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And for the second time the Blessed One thus addressed those Bhikkhus: 'Enough, O Bhikkhus, &amp;c.' And for the second time that Bhikkhu who adhered to the party who were wrong, said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One, &amp;c.' Then the Blessed One spoke thus to those Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.3">2.3</a> 'In former times, O Bhikkhus, there lived at <a id="pg294"><span class="f2 g"><b>[294]</b></span></a> Benares a king of Kāsi, Brahmadatta by name, wealthy, rich in treasures, rich in revenues, rich in troops and vehicles, the lord over a great realm, with full treasuries and storehouses. And there was also a king of Kosala, D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti by name, not wealthy, poor in treasures, poor in revenues, poor in troops and vehicles, the lord over a small realm, with empty treasuries and storehouses.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And king Brahmadatta, O Bhikkhus, of Kāsi, having set the four hosts of his army in array, went out to war with king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala heard, O Bhikkhus: "King Brahmadatta of Kāsi, having set the four hosts of his army in array, has gone out to war with me." Then king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala thought, O Bhikkhus: "King Brahmadatta of Kāsi is wealthy, rich in treasures, &amp;c.; and I am not wealthy, poor in treasures, &amp;c. I am not able to stand against even one attack of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi. What if I were to flee from the town beforehand."</p>

					<p class="f4">'And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, took his queen-consort with him and fled from the town beforehand.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, O Bhikkhus, conquered the troops and vehicles, the realm, the treasuries and storehouses of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, and took possession of them.</p>

					<p class="f4">And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, together with his consort, went forth to Benares. Wandering from place to place he came to Benares, and there at Benares, O Bhikkhus, king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala dwelt, together with his consort, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg295"><span class="f2 g"><b>[295]</b></span></a> <a id="p2.4">2.4</a> 'And ere long, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala became pregnant. And there came upon her the longing of pregnant women; and she desired, at sunrise, to see an army, with its four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and to drink the water in which the swords were washed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And the queen-consort, O Bhikkhus, of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala said to king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala: "I am pregnant, Lord, and the longing of pregnancy has come upon me; and I desire, at sunrise, &amp;c."</p>

					<p class="f4">'(The king replied): "Whence shall come, O queen, to people in distress like us, an army with four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and the water in which the swords are washed?"</p>

					<p class="f4">'(The queen said): "If I do not obtain it, Lord, I shall die."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.5">2.5</a> 'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, the Brāhma<i>n</i>a who was domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, was a friend of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala. And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, went to the place where that Brāhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, was; having approached him he said to that Brāhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi: "Your lady-friend, my beloved, is pregnant, and the longing of pregnant women has come upon her; and she desires (&amp;c., as above)."</p>

					<p class="f4">'(The Brāhma<i>n</i>a replied): "Well, O king, let us see the queen also."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala went to the place where that Brāhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta <a id="pg296"><span class="f2 g"><b>[296]</b></span></a> of Kāsi, was. And, O Bhikkhus, that Brāhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, saw the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala coming from afar. On seeing her he rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, raised his joined hands to the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, and three times uttered this exclamation: "Verily a Kosala king dwells in thy womb! Verily a Kosala king dwells in thy womb!" (And further he said): "Do not despond, O queen, you will obtain the sight at sunrise of an army with its four hosts set in array, clad in armour, standing on auspicious ground, and you will obtain the drinking of the water in which the swords are washed."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.6">2.6</a> And, O Bhikkhus, that Brāhma<i>n</i>a, the domestic chaplain to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, went to the place where king Brahmadatta of Kāsi was. Having approached him, he said to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi: "Lord, the signs that appear are such, that to-morrow at sunrise an army with four hosts, set in array, clad in armour, must station itself on auspicious ground, and the swords must be washed."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kāsi gave order to his attendants: "Do, my friends, what the Brāhma<i>n</i>a, my domestic chaplain, tells you."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Thus, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala obtained the sight at sunrise, &amp;c., and the drinking of the water in which the swords were washed.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And, O Bhikkhus, the queen-consort of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, when the child in her womb had reached maturity, gave birth to a boy. They called <a id="pg297"><span class="f2 g"><b>[297]</b></span></a> him D&icirc;ghāvu ("Longeval"). And ere long, O Bhikkhus, young D&icirc;ghāvu came to the years of discretion.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.7">2.7</a> 'And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, thought: "This king Brahmadatta of Kāsi has done much harm to us. By him we have been robbed of our troops and vehicles, our realm, our treasuries and storehouses. Should he find us out here, he will have us all three killed. What if I were to cause young D&icirc;ghāvu to dwell outside the town."</p>

					<p class="f4">Then king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, caused young D&icirc;ghāvu to dwell outside the town. And young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, dwelling outside the town, ere long learnt all arts.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.8">2.8</a> 'At that time, O Bhikkhus, the barber of king Dig-hid of Kosala dwelt at the court of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi. Now, O Bhikkhus, this barber of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala saw king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala dwelling, together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic. When he had seen him, he went to the place where king Brahmadatta of Kāsi was, and having approached him, he said to king Brahmadatta of Kāsi: "King D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, Your Majesty, dwells, together with his consort, at Benares, at a certain place near the town, in a potter's dwelling, in disguise, in the guise of a wandering ascetic."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.9">2.9</a> Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kāsi gave order to his attendants: "Well, my friends, bring king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala and his consort before me."</p>

					<p class="f4">And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi (by saying), <a id="pg298"><span class="f2 g"><b>[298]</b></span></a> "Yes, Your Majesty," and brought king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala and his consort before him.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kāsi gave order to his attendants: "Well, my friends, bind king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala and his consort firmly with strong ropes, tie their arms to their backs, have them close shaven, lead them around with loud beatings of drums from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way, then lead them out of the town by the southern gate, hew them in four pieces to the south of the town, and throw the pieces away to the four quarters."</p>

					<p class="f4">'And those people, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty," bound king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala and his consort firmly with strong ropes, tied their arms to their backs, had them close shaven, and led them around with loud beatings of drums from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.10">2.10</a> 'Now, O Bhikkhus, young D&icirc;ghāvu thought "For a long time I have not seen my father and mother. What if I were to go and see my father and mother." And young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, entered Benares, and saw his father and mother, bound firmly with strong ropes, their arms tied to their backs, close shaven, and being led around with loud beating of drums from "road to road and from cross-way to cross-way. When he saw that, he went up to his father and mother.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala, O Bhikkhus, saw young D&icirc;ghāvu coming from afar; seeing young D&icirc;ghāvu he said to him: "Do not look long, my dear D&icirc;ghāvu, and do not look short<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span>. For not by <a id="pg299"><span class="f2 g"><b>[299]</b></span></a> hatred, my dear D&icirc;ghāvu, is hatred appeased; by not-hatred, my dear D&icirc;ghāvu, hatred is appeased."</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.11">2.11</a> 'When he had spoken thus, O Bhikkhus, the people said to king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala: "This king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala is mad and raves. What has this D&icirc;ghāvu to do with him? Who is he to whom he says: Do not look long, &amp;c.?'" (D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti replied): "I am not mad, my friends, nor do I rave.

					<p class="f4">'And for the second time, &amp;c. And for the third time, O Bhikkhus, king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala said to young- D&icirc;ghāvu, &amp;c. And for the third time said the people (&amp;c., down to:) "He who is clever will understand it."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then those people, O Bhikkhus, having led king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala and his consort around from road to road and from cross-way to cross-way, led them out of the town by the southern gate, hewed them in four pieces to the south of the town, threw the pieces away to the four quarters, stationed there a troop of soldiers, and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.12">2.12</a> Then young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, went to Benares, got strong drink there, and made those soldiers drink it. When they were drunk and had fallen down, he gathered the pieces (of the two bodies), made a funeral pile, put his father's and his mother's bodies on that pile, set it on fire, and raising his clasped hands he three times circumambulated the funeral pile.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now at that time, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kāsi had gone up on to the terrace of his splendid palace.

When he saw that, he thought: "Doubtless this man is a relation or kinsman of king D&icirc;gh&icirc;ti of Kosala. Alas for my misfortune, that nobody will tell me (what this means)!"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.13">2.13</a> 'And young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, went to the forest. There he cried and wept to his heart's content.

					<p class="f4">'"Well, my good young man, learn it."</p>

					<p class="f4">'And young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, arose in the night, at dawn's time, and sung in the elephant stables in a beautiful voice, and played upon the lute. And king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, O Bhikkhus, having risen in the night, at dawn, heard that singing in a beautiful voice and that playing upon the lute in the elephant stables. On hearing that he asked his attendants: "Who is it, my friends, who has risen in the night, at dawn's time, and has sung in the elephant stables in so beautiful a voice, and has played upon the lute?"</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2.14">2.14</a> '(The attendants replied): "A young pupil, Your Majesty, of such and such an elephant trainer, has risen in the night, at dawn, and has sung it the elephant stables in so beautiful a voice, and has played upon the lute."</p>

					<p class="f4">'Young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, accepted this order of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi (by saying), "Yes, Your Majesty." And young D&icirc;ghāvu, O Bhikkhus, became (a servant) of king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, rising before him, lying down after him, willingly obeying all his commands, agreeable in his conduct, pleasing in his words. And ere long, O Bhikkhus, king Brahmadatta of Kāsi gave to young D&icirc;ghāvu an intimate position of trust.</p>

					<p class="f4">'And king Brahmadatta of Kāsi, O Bhikkhus, ascended the chariot, and young D&icirc;ghāvu drove the chariot: and he drove the chariot in such a way that the hosts (of the royal retinue) went one way, and the chariot went another way.</p>

Now the time has come to me to satisfy my hatred,"--(thinking thus) he unsheathed his sword. Then, O Bhikkhus, young D&icirc;ghāvu thought: "My father said to me in the hour of his death: 'Do not look long, my dear D&icirc;ghāvu, and do not look short.

He is not perplexed, nor does he tremble, when he enters an assembly<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn30" href="#n30">30</a>]</sup></span>. He does not disparage his cause by vain talk.</p>

					<p class="f4">'So also when he is asked questions in the assemblies, he does not hesitate, and is not troubled. By his timely words, that solve the questions, the clever man gladdens the assembly of the wise.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Full of reverence for elder Bhikkhus, well versed in what his teacher has taught him, able to find out (the right), a master of speech, and skilled in making his rivals fail,</p>

					<p class="f4">'By whom his rivals are annihilated, by whom many people receive instruction,--he does not for-sake the cause he has taken up, (nor does he become tired) of answering questions and putting questions without hurting others;</p>

					<p class="f4">'If he is charged with a mission, he takes it upon himself properly, and in the business of the Saŋgha (he does) what they tell him<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn31" href="#n31">31</a>]</sup></span>;--when a number of Bhikkhus despatches him (somewhere), he obeys <a id="pg325"><span class="f2 g"><b>[325]</b></span></a> their command, but he does not think therefrom, "It is I who do this;"--</p>

					<p class="f4">'In what cases a Bhikkhu commits an offence, what an offence is, and how it is atoned for, both these expositions are well known to him<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn32" href="#n32">32</a>]</sup></span>; he is versed in the rules about offence and atonement;--</p>

'Both' refers to the Bhikkhuvibha&#7749;ga and Bhikkhun&icirc;vibha&#7749;ga. In the text, ubhayassa must be corrected into ubhay&#8217; assa, i.e. ubhaye assa.</p>
