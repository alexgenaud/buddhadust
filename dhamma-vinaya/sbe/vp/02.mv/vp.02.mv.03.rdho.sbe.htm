					<h4 class="ctr c">Third Khandhaka</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Residence During The Rainy Season, Vassa</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:1">1.</a> At that time the Blessed One dwelt at Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, in the Kalandakanivāpa<a id="page_298_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>. At that time the retreat during the rainy season had not yet been instituted by the Blessed One for the Bhikkhus. Thus the Bhikkhus went on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:2">2.</a> People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry, saying, 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season? They crush the green herbs, they hurt vegetable life<a id="page_298_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, they destroy the life of many small living things. Shall the ascetics who belong to Titthiya schools, whose doctrine is ill preached, retire during the rainy season and arrange places for themselves to live in<a id="page_298_fr_3"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>? shall the birds make their nests on the summits of the trees, and retire during <a id="page_299"><span class="f1 g">p. 299</span></a> the rainy season, and arrange themselves places to live in; and yet the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season, crushing the green herbs, hurting vegetable life, and destroying the life of many small things?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:3">3.</a> Now some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you enter upon Vassa<a id="page_299_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:1">1.</a> Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'When are we to enter upon Vassa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you enter upon Vassa in the rainy season.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:2">2.</a> Then the Bhikkhus thought: 'How many periods are there for entering upon Vassa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'There are two periods, O Bhikkhus, for entering upon Vassa, the earlier and the later. The earlier time for entering (upon Vassa) is the day after the <a id="page_300"><span class="f1 g">p. 300</span></a> full moon of āsā<i>lh</i>a (June-July); the later, a month after the full moon of āsā<i>lh</i>a<a id="page_300_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>. These, O Bhikkhus, are the two periods for entering upon Vassa..'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:1">1.</a> At that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, having entered upon Vassa, went on their travels during the period of Vassa. People were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go on their travels alike during winter, summer, and the rainy season, . . . (&amp;c., as in chap. 1. 2, down to:) and destroy the life of many small living things?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:2">2.</a> Now some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. The moderate Bhikkhus were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, having entered upon Vassa, go on their travels during the period of Vassa?'</p>

					<p class="f4">These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="page_301"><span class="f1 g">p. 301</span></a>In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, who has entered upon Vassa, go on his travels before he has kept Vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. He who does so, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p4">4.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:1">1.</a> At that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus were not willing to enter upon Vassā.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, forbear to enter upon Vassa. He who does not enter upon Vassa, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:2">2.</a> At that time the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus, who were not willing to enter upon Vassa on the prescribed day, purposely left the district (where they were living).</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Let no one, O Bhikkhus, purposely leave the district (where he is living), because he is not willing to enter upon Vassa on the prescribed day. He who does, commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:3">3.</a> At that time the Magadha king Seniya Bimbisāra, who wished that the Vassa period might be postponed, sent a messenger to the Bhikkhus: 'What if their reverences were to enter upon Vassa on the next full moon day?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you obey kings.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p5">5.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:1">1.</a> And the Blessed One, after having resided at Rā<i>g</i>agaha as long as he thought fit, went forth to Sāvatthi. Wandering from place to place he came to Sāvatthi. There, at Sāvatthi, the Blessed One dwelt in the <i>G</i>etavana, the garden of Anāthapi<i>nd</i>ika.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time an upāsaka (lay devotee) named Udena, in the Kosala country, had a Vihāra built for the Saŋgha. He sent a messenger to the Bhikkhus (saying), 'Might their reverences come hither; I desire to bestow gifts (on the Saŋgha) and to hear the Dhamma and to see the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:2">2.</a> The Bhikkhus replied: 'The Blessed One has prescribed, friend, that no one who has entered upon Vassa, may go on a journey before he has kept Vassa during the earlier or during the later three months. Let the upāsaka Udena wait so long as the Bhikkhus keep their Vassa residence; when they have finished Vassa, they will go. But if there is any urgent necessity, let him dedicate the Vihāra in presence of the Bhikkhus who reside there.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:3">3.</a> The upāsaka Udena was annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can their reverences, when I send for them, refuse to come? I am a giver and a doer (of good works), and do service to the fraternity.' Some Bhikkhus heard the upāsaka Udena, who was annoyed, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="f4">These Bhikkhus told the thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:4">4.</a> In consequence of that the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 22, 17. About the name of Kalandakanivāpa (seeds of Kalandaka? feeding ground for squirrels?), see the story related in Beal, Romantic Legend, &amp;c., p. 315, where this place is said to be the gift of a merchant named Kalandaka. A different account is given by Spence Hardy, Manual, p. 194.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> Literally, living creatures which have but one organ of sense; that is, which have only the organ of feeling, viz. the outward form (kāya).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> Sa<i>m</i>kāpayissanti = sa<i>m</i>kappafissanti? Buddhaghosa: appossukka-nibaddha-vāsa<i>m</i> vasissanti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> I.e. enter upon the retreat prescribed for the rainy season. Buddhaghosa: 'They are to look after their Vihāra (if it is in a proper state), to provide food and water for themselves, to fulfil all due ceremonies, such as paying reverence to sacred shrines, &amp;c., and to say loudly once, or twice, or thrice: "I enter upon Vassa in this Vihāra for these three months." Thus they are to enter upon Vassa.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> Very probably this double period stands in connection with the double period prescribed in the Brāhmanas and Sûtras for most of the Vedic festivals. Thus the sacrifice of the varu<i>n</i>apraghāsās, with which the Brahmans began the rainy season, was to be held either on the full moon day of āshā<i>dh</i>a or on the full moon day of the following month, <i>S</i>rāva<i>n</i>a, quite in accordance with the Buddhistical rules about the vassupanāyikā. The Brāhma<i>n</i>a texts begin the year with the full moon day of the (uttarā) Phālgunî; the Sûtras mention, besides the Phālguni, another new-year's day, the <i>K</i>aitri paur<i>n</i>amāsî, which falls one month later. It was in connection with this dislocation of the beginning of the year that the annual festivals could be postponed accordingly. See Weber, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, p. 329 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 25, 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> The enumeration of edifices is identical with that given in § 6, but in the cases beginning with that of the sisterhood of Bhikkhunîs (according to Buddhaghosa; we believe that the two cases referring to sāma<i>n</i>eras ought to be excepted) three of the edifices are left out, viz. the privy, the <i>g</i>antāghara, and the <i>g</i>antāghara room, the' use of which is forbidden to nuns; see <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 27, 3, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> See Abhidhānapp. v. 213, and compare assabha<i>nd</i>a, hatthibhanda (Mahāvagga I, 61, I).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 16, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> See Abhidhānapp. v. 309.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Only it is said here of the Bhikkhus, ayyā, 'the noble ones,' instead of bhaddantā, 'their reverences.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> See §§ 2-5. Read here and in all cases where the messenger is sent by a woman: 'Might the noble ones (ayyā) come to me; I long for the noble ones' coming.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> There is no parivāsa discipline for the Bhikkhunîs. When a Bhikkhunî has committed a Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa offence, no matter whether she has concealed it or not, she is sentenced to mānatta discipline for a fortnight. See <i>K</i>ullavagga X, I, 4; 25, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> The phrases, 'Or I will propose the resolution to the assembly, or I will help to complete the quorum' (see § 6 seq.), of course are omitted here, because, if the proceeding is directed against a Bhikkhunî, this is to be done by a Bhikkhunî and not by a Bhikkhu. See <i>K</i>ullavagga X, 6, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> This translation of sikkhi kupitā hoti is merely conjectural; Buddhaghosa has no note here. Comp. kuppa and akuppa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> The technical meaning of vassa<i>m</i> pu<i>kkh</i>itu<i>m</i> (to ask after Vassa?) is unknown to us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: bhikkhugatika is a person that dwells in the same Vihāra with the Bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 300.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> See Rh. D.'s 'Ancient Coins and Measures of Ceylon,' p. 5 ('Numismata Orientalia,' vol. i).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> See §§ 6-9. lnstead of 'A number of Bhikkhus' in these paragraphs, the subject is 'A number of Bhikkhunîs.' Instead of 'Friends ' or 'Sirs,' the address is 'Sisters.' In §§ 11, 13 read: 'Those Bhikkhunîs are not friends of mine, but their (female) friends are friends of mine, &amp;c.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> This must be about the sense of pisā<i>k</i>illika (comp. <i>K</i>ullavagga V, 10, 2; 27, 5), although we are nat sure how -illika ought to be explained.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> Visākhā was the most distinguished among the upāsikās, and occupied a place among them similar to that which Anāthapi<i>nd</i>ika, with whom she is frequently mentioned together, did among the upāsakas. See Dhammapada A<i>tth</i>ak. p. 78, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> See chap. 2, § 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> See chap. 5 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> I.e.. before the concluding ceremony of Vassa; see IV, 1, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> Here follows an exact repetition of alI the cases given in §§ 5-7; the only difference is, that in the former cases it was said: 'When going to that district, he holds Uposatha outside,' instead of which it is said now: 'Having gone to that district, he holds Uposatha there.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n30" href="#fn30">30</a>]</sup> The cases given in §§ 5-10 are repeated here; instead of 'Earlier period,' it is said here 'Later period;' instead of 'Before the Pavāra<i>n</i>ā' (§7), 'Before the komudi <i>k</i>ātumāsini.' The komudi <i>k</i>ātumāsini is the full moon day in the month Kattika, which is frequently called Kaumuda in the Epic literature; the epithet <i>k</i>ātumāsini refers to the Vedic <i>K</i>āturmāsra festival, which falls upon that day (Kātrāyana, <i>S</i>rautasûtra V, 6, I). For those who entered upon Vassa at the later period (in the <i>S</i>rāvana month), the end of Vassa fell on the Komudî day.</p>
