					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the Blessed One dwelt at Sāvatthi, in the <i>G</i>etavana, the park of Anātha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika. And at that time Bhikkhus, attacked by the sickness of the hot season<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>, threw up the rice-milk they had drunk, and the food they had eaten. And thereby they became lean, rough, ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and the veins stood out on their limbs<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One saw those Bhikkhus thus lean, rough, ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and with the veins standing out on their limbs. And on seeing it, he asked the venerable &Acirc;nanda:</p>

					<p class="f4">'How is it, &Acirc;nanda, that the Bhikkhus are become now so lean, rough, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'At this time, Lord, the Bhikkhus are attacked with the disease of the hot season; and they throw up the rice-milk they have drunk, and the food they have eaten. Thence is it that they are become lean, rough, ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and that the veins stand out on their limbs.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Then there occurred to the mind of the</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg42"><span class="f2 g"><b>[42]</b></span></a> Blessed One, when meditating alone, this consideration: 'At this time the Bhikkhus (&amp;c., down to:) on their limbs. What medicaments shall I now prescribe for the Bhikkhus, as may be authorised as common medicine, and may be diffused through the body, though it be not regarded as ordinary (material) food?' And the Blessed One thought: 'These five medicaments--that is to say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, molasses--are such medicaments. Let me then prescribe them as medicines which the Bhikkhus may accept at the right time, and use at the right time.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> And in the evening, when the Blessed One had arisen from his meditation, having delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus in that connection, saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'When I was meditating alone, O Bhikkhus, then occurred to my mind this consideration: "At this time (&amp;c., as in §2, down to:) material food." Then I thought: "These five (&amp;c., as in §2, down to:) at the right time." I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, these five things as medicine to be accepted at the right time, and to be used at the right time.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> Now at that time the Bhikkhus accepted those five things at the right time, and used them at the right time. And foods which though rough, were ordinary foods, they could not digest<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, much less greasy foods<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>. Then they--attacked both by the hot-season disease, and by this want of appetite<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>--became by both at once still more lean, rough,<a id="pg43"><span class="f2 g"><b>[43]</b></span></a> ill-favoured, yellow and ever yellower, and with the veins standing out on their limbs.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the 'Blessed One saw the Bhikkhus thus still more lean, &amp;c. And when he saw it, he asked the venerable &Acirc;nanda: 'How is it, &Acirc;nanda, that the Bhikkhus are become now still more lean, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> 'At present, Lord, these Bhikkhus, who use the five medicaments only at the right time, cannot digest foods which, though ordinary, are rough, much less greasy foods. Then they, attacked (&amp;c., as in §4, down to:) standing out on their limbs.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One on that occasion, having delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'I permit you, O Bhikkhus, not only to receive those five medicaments, but to use them both at the right time, and at other times.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And at that time the daughter of that park-keeper's wife, seeing the other children with their ornaments on, and decked with garlands, began to <a id="pg64"><span class="f2 g"><b>[64]</b></span></a> cry (saying), 'Give me too a garland, give me an ornament!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This girl, venerable Sir, seeing the other children with their ornaments on, and decked with garlands, is crying (and saying), "Give me too a garland, give me too an ornament!" But whence should we, who have become so poor, get garlands or ornaments?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra had (the whole of) that park-keeper's family thrown into bonds.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p15.7">15.7</a> Now the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a robed himself again early in the morning, and went, duly bowled and robed, into Pilinda-gāma for alms.

And when he was so seated the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a said to the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a determined that the palace of the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra should be gold. And it became all of gold.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now, your Majesty, whence have you this so great quantity of gold?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I understand, Lord. This is your miraculous power' (said the king. And so saying) he set that park-keeper's family free.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p15.9">15.9</a> When the people, glad at heart and full of satisfaction, saw that so great a miracle had been shown by the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a to the king and his royal retinue, they brought to the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a the five kinds of medicine,--that is to <a id="pg66"><span class="f2 g"><b>[66]</b></span></a> say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses. Now (besides this) the venerable Pilindava<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a was accustomed to receive the five kinds of medicine; and whatever he received he distributed among his attendant (Bhikkhus). So the retinue became abounding therein, and as they received it they laid it aside, filling vessels and pots; and filling water-strainers and bags with it they laid them in the windows, and they remained there clinging and adhering together, and the Vihāras became sprinkled and scattered all over with them through the (gnawing of) rats. People who saw this, when they went round the Vihāras, were annoyed, murmured, and became indignant (saying), 'These Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as are becoming storers up of goods like the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p15.10">15.10</a> The Bhikkhus heard the people thus murmuring, &amp;c. And those Bhikkhus who were moderate were indignant, &amp;c., saying,</p>

					<p class="f4">'How can Bhikkhus think (of possessing) such abundance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And those Bhikkhus told the matter to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is it true, Bhikkhus, as they say, that Bhikkhus think (of possessing) such abundance?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One rebuked them, and after delivering a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whatsoever kinds of medicine are meet for the use of sick Bhikkhus,--that is to say, ghee, butter, oil, honey, and molasses,--when such are received they must be used within a period of seven days during which they may be stored up.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p17.3">17.3</a> The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, &Acirc;nanda, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, not allowable, and ought to be avoided.

					<p class="f4">And when he had rebuked him, and delivered a religious discourse. he said to the Bhikkhus: Whatsoever is kept indoors, O Bhikkhus, or cooked indoors, or cooked of your own accord, is not to be eaten. Whosoever shall eat thereof, is guilty of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.</p>

					<p class="f4">In the time of scarcity, those who (by offering food, inviting Bhikkhus to their houses, &amp;c.) made (the accepting or eating of food) allowable (to the Bhikkhus), used to take more (for themselves), and give less to the Bhikkhus.</p>

And there was plenty of eatable fruit, but there was no one to make it allowable for them<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn90" href="#n90">90</a>]</sup></span>. And those Bhikkhus went on in weariness to Rā<i>g</i>agaha, to the Veluvana, in the Kalandaka-nivāpa, where the Blessed One was. And when they had come there, they bowed down before the Blessed One, and took their seats on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now it is the custom of the Blessed Buddhas to exchange courteous greetings with Bhikkhus who <a id="pg72"><span class="f2 g"><b>[72]</b></span></a> arrive. And the Blessed One said to those Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, in that connection, after having delivered a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, wherever edible fruit is seen and there is no one to make it allowable, to pick it of your own accord, and take it away.

And that Brāhman went to the place where the Blessed One was, and when he had come there, he exchanged courteous greetings with the Blessed One.

					<p class="f4">And that Brāhman satisfied with the sweet food, hard and soft, the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head, and waited on them with his own hand.

					<p class="f4">'What is the matter with you?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suppiyā, the lay-devotee, told the whole matter to Suppiya, the lay-devotee. And Suppiya, the lay-devotee, said: 'Oh wonderful! oh astonishing! How believing and how pious is this Suppiyā who gives even her own flesh (to the indigent). What else can there be which she would not give?' (Speaking thus), joyful and elated he went to the place where the Blessed One. was; having approached him, and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p23.5">23.5</a> Sitting near him, Suppiya, the lay-devotee, said to the Blessed One: 'Might the Blessed One, Lord, consent to take his meal with me to-morrow, together with the fraternity of Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent. Then Suppiya, the lay-devotee, when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted <a id="pg83"><span class="f2 g"><b>[83]</b></span></a> the Blessed One, and passing round him with his right side towards him, went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the night had elapsed, Suppiya, the lay-devotee, ordered excellent food, both hard and soft, to be prepared, and had the meal-time announced to the Blessed One in the words: 'It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.' And in the fore-noon the Blessed One, having put on his under-robes, took his alms-bowl, and, with his <i>k</i>&icirc;vara on, went to the house of Suppiya, the lay-devotee. When he had arrived there, he sat down with the Bhikkhus who followed him, on seats laid out for them.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p23.6">23.6</a> And Suppiya, the lay-devotee, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he stationed himself near him.

					<p class="f4">'She is sick, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'She is not able to do so, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well then you must take her and carry her (to me).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Suppiya, the lay-devotee, took Suppiyā, the lay-devotee, and carried her (to the Buddha). And in the moment the Blessed One saw her, that great wound was healed; and there was good skin there, with the tiny hairs thereon.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p23.7">23.7</a> And Suppiya, the lay-devotee, and Suppiyā, the lay-devotee (thought): 'Oh wonderful! oh astonishing!

And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and cleansed his bowl and his hands, they sat down near him. And the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated, and gladdened Suppiya, the lay-devotee, and Suppiyā, the lay-devotee, by religious discourse, rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p23.8">23.8</a> In consequence of that, and on this occasion, the Blessed One, having ordered the fraternity of Bhikkhus to assemble, questioned the Bhikkhus: 'Who was it, O Bhikkhus, who asked Suppiyā, the lay-devotee, for meat?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When he had spoken thus, that Bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: 'It is I, Lord, who asked Suppiyā, the lay-devotee, for meat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Having rebuked him and delivered a religious discourse, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'There are, O Bhikkhus, believing, pious people who give <a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> up even their own flesh.

At that time the people in the country, after having loaded their carts with much salt and oil and rice and hard food, followed from behind the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head (thinking), 'When our turn comes, we will make a meal for them;' and five hundred people who ate the remains of (the Bhikkhus') food (followed on their way).

And when he had come there, he bowed down before the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was so seated the Blessed One preached (&amp;c., as usual, for instance, I, 8, 2; 3, down to:) 'taken his refuge in him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Blessed One consent to take his meal, together with the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha, at my house to-morrow.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One consented by remaining silent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.14">34.14</a> Then Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder when he saw that the Blessed One had consented (&amp;c., as usual, see VI, 18, 1, 2, down to:) sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.15">34.15</a> Then the wife, and the son, and the daughter-in-law, and the slave of Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder went to the place where the Blessed One was: and when they had come there they bowed down before the Blessed One and took their seats on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One preached to them (&amp;c., as in §13, down to:) 'taken their refuge in him.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.16">34.16</a> Then Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder served the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head (&amp;c., as usual, down to:) sat down on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he was so seated Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder said to the Blessed One: 'So long as the Blessed One shall stay at Bhaddiya, so long will I provide the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head with food every day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One gladdened (&amp;c., as usual, down to:) the Blessed One rose from his seat, and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.17">34.17</a> Now when the Blessed One had remained <a id="pg127"><span class="f2 g"><b>[127]</b></span></a> at Bhaddiya as long as he thought fit, he went on, without informing Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder, to Aṅguttarāpa with a great company of Bhikkhus, with one thousand two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="f4">And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder heard: 'The Blessed One, they say, has gone on to Aṅguttarāpa with (&amp;c., down to:) Bhikkhus.' And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder gave command to his slaves and servants: 'Load then, my men, a quantity of salt and oil, and rice, and hard food, and come: and let one thousand two hundred and fifty cow-keepers come with one thousand two hundred and fifty cows.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.18">34.18</a> And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder came up with the Blessed One in a desert place on the way. And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder went up to the place where the Blessed One was: and when he had come he stood on one side.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.19">34.19</a> And the Blessed One early in the morning (&amp;c., down to:) sat down on the seat prepared for him.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder gave command to those thousand two hundred and fifty cow-keepers: 'Take then, my men, each of you a cow, and wait each of you upon a. Bhikkhu, and provide him with fresh milk.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder waited upon the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head with his own hand, and satisfied them with sweet food, hard and soft, and with fresh milk.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg128"><span class="f2 g"><b>[128]</b></span></a> The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not take the milk:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Take it, Bhikkhus, and drink it.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.20">34.20</a> And Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder, when he had waited with his own hand upon the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head, and had satisfied them with sweet food, hard and soft, and with fresh milk; and when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had washed his hands and his bowl, took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4">And, so sitting, Me<i>n</i><i>d</i>aka the householder said to the Blessed One: 'There are desert ways, Lord, waterless and foodless, where it is not easy to travel without supplies for the journey.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p34.21">34.21</a> And the Blessed One, in that connection, and on that account, after having delivered a religious discourse, said to the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p35">35.</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.1">35.1</a> Now the Blessed One proceeded straight on, on his alms-pilgrimage, to &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a. And Keniya the ascetic<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn149" href="#n149">149</a>]</sup></span> heard the saying, 'Behold! the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama, who was born in the Sākya clan, and who went forth from the Sākya clan (to adopt the religious life), has arrived at &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a, and is staying at &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad that he is said to be a fully-enlightened one, blessed and worthy, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed, who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, a teacher of gods and men, a blessed Buddha. He by himself thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were face to face, this universe, the world with its Devas, and with its Brahmas, and with its Māras, and all creatures, Sama<i>n</i>as and Brāhma<i>n</i>as, gods and men: and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he make known, both in the spirit and in the letter: <a id="pg130"><span class="f2 g"><b>[130]</b></span></a> lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation. The higher life doth he proclaim, in all its purity and all its perfectness. Blessed is the sight of Arahats like that<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn150" href="#n150">150</a>]</sup></span>!' And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'What now should I have taken<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn151" href="#n151">151</a>]</sup></span> to the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.2">35.2</a> And Keniya the ascetic thought: 'They who are the ancient <i>Ri</i>shis of the Brāhmans, the authors of the sacred verses, the utterers of the sacred verses, whose ancient form of words, so uttered chaunted or composed, the Brāhmans of to-day chaunt over again and repeat, intoning or reciting exactly as had been intoned or recited--to wit, A<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Aṅgirasa, Bhāradvā<i>g</i>a, Vāse<i>t</i><i>th</i>a, and Bhagu<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn152" href="#n152">152</a>]</sup></span>--they were abstainers from food at night, and abstainers from food at the wrong time, yet they used to receive such things as drinks.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.3">35.3</a> Now the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama is also an abstainer from food <a id="pg131"><span class="f2 g"><b>[131]</b></span></a> at night, an abstainer from food at the wrong time<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn153" href="#n153">153</a>]</sup></span>. It will be worthy of him too to receive such things as drinks. And when he had had a quantity of drinkables made ready he had them carried on pingoes and went up to the place where the Blessed One was. And when he had come there, he greeted him; and after exchanging with him the greetings of friendship and civility, he stood by on one side. And so standing Keniya the ascetic spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the Blessed One accept at my hands these drinkables.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good then, Keniya; give them to the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, would not receive them.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Receive them, O Bhikkhus, and make use of them.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.4">35.4</a> Then Keniya the ascetic having, with his own hand, satisfied the Bhikkhu-sa<i>m</i>gha with the Buddha at their head with many drinkables until they refused any more, took his seat, when the Blessed One had washed his hands, and had laid aside the bowl, on one side. And when he was so seated the Blessed One taught and incited and aroused and gladdened Keniya the ascetic with religious discourse: and Keniya the ascetic, when he had been taught and incited and aroused and gladdened by the Blessed One with religious discourse, spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the venerable Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the to-morrow's meal for him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg132"><span class="f2 g"><b>[132]</b></span></a> <a id="p35.5">35.5</a> 'Great, O Keniya, is the company of the Bhikkhus. Two hundred and fifty are the Bhikkhus in number. And thou art greatly devoted to the Brāhmans.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet a second time spake Keniya the ascetic to the Blessed One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What though the company of the Bhikkhus, O Gotama, be great; and though two hundred and fifty be the number of the Bhikkhus. May the venerable Gotama grant to me the privilege of providing the to-morrow's meal for him, together with the company of the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Great, O Keniya (&amp;c., as before).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Yet a third time spake Keniya the ascetic to the venerable Gotama thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'What though the company of the Bhikkhus (&amp;c., as before).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One granted, by remaining silent, his consent. And when Keniya the ascetic perceived that the Blessed One had granted his consent, he arose from his seat, and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.6">35.6</a> Then the Blessed One on that occasion, and in that connection, after he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, eight kinds of drink-able things: mango-syrup, and jambu-syrup, and plantain-syrup<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn154" href="#n154">154</a>]</sup></span>, and mo<i>k</i>a-syrup, and honey, and <a id="pg133"><span class="f2 g"><b>[133]</b></span></a> grape juice, and syrup made from the edible root of the water-lily<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn155" href="#n155">155</a>]</sup></span>, and phārusaka<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn156" href="#n156">156</a>]</sup></span>-syrup. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the juice of all fruits, except the juice prepared from corn<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn157" href="#n157">157</a>]</sup></span>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks prepared from all leaves, except drinks prepared from potherbs<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn158" href="#n158">158</a>]</sup></span>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, drinks prepared from all flowers, except liquorice-juice<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn159" href="#n159">159</a>]</sup></span>. I allow you, O Bhikkhus, the use of the juice of the sugar cane.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.7">35.7</a> And Keniya the ascetic, at the end of the night, had sweet food, both hard and soft, made ready at his hermitage: and he had the time announced to the Blessed One, saying, 'It is time, O Gotama, and the meal is ready.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, having put on his under robes early in the morning, went, duly bowled and . robed, to the place where the hermitage of Keniya the ascetic was. And when he had arrived there, he sat down on the seat spread out for him, and with him the company of the Bhikkhus. Then <a id="pg134"><span class="f2 g"><b>[134]</b></span></a> Keniya the ascetic, with his own hand, offered to the company of the Bhikkhus with the Buddha at their head, and satisfied them with the sweet food, both hard and soft. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal and had washed his hands and his bowl, he (Keniya) took his seat on one side.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p35.8">35.8</a> And when he was so seated the Blessed One pronounced the benediction on Keniya the ascetic in these verses:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Of the offerings<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn160" href="#n160">160</a>]</sup></span> the fire sacrifice is the chief, of sacred verses the chief is the Sāvitthi<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn161" href="#n161">161</a>]</sup></span>;</p>

					<p class="f4">'Among men the king is chief; and of waters the ocean,</p>

					<p class="f4">But of them, the conquering ones, who long after good, the Saṅgha, verily, is chief.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when the Blessed One had, in these verses, pronounced the benediction<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn162" href="#n162">162</a>]</sup></span> on Keniya the ascetic, he rose from his seat, and departed thence<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn163" href="#n163">163</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p36">36.</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.1">36.1</a> Now when the Blessed One had stayed at &Acirc;pa<i>n</i>a as long as he thought fit, he went on, on his pilgrimage, to Kusinārā, with a great company <a id="pg135"><span class="f2 g"><b>[135]</b></span></a> of Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. And the Mallas of Kusinārā heard, saying, 'The Blessed One, they say, is coming to Kusinārā with a great company of Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.' And they established a compact to the effect that whosoever went not forth to welcome the Blessed One, should pay a fine of five hundred (pieces<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn164" href="#n164">164</a>]</sup></span>).</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time there was a certain Malla, by name Ro<i>g</i>a, who was a friend of the venerable &Acirc;nanda's. And the Blessed One, continuing in due course his pilgrimage, arrived at Kusinārā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.2">36.2</a> Then the Mallas of Kusinārā went forth to welcome the Blessed One. And Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, having gone forth to welcome the Blessed One, went on to the place where the venerable &Acirc;nanda was: and when he had come there, he saluted the venerable &Acirc;nanda, and stood by on one side. And to him, so standing, the venerable &Acirc;nanda spake thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This is most excellent of thee, friend Ro<i>g</i>a, that thou hast come forth to welcome the Blessed One!'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is not I, O &Acirc;nanda, who am much moved<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn165" href="#n165">165</a>]</sup></span> by the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Saṅgha. But by the clansmen a compact was made to the effect that whosoever went not forth to welcome the Blessed One should pay a fine of five hundred (pieces). So that it was through fear of being fined <a id="pg136"><span class="f2 g"><b>[136]</b></span></a> by my clansmen that even I went forth to welcome the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda was filled with sorrow, thinking, 'How can Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla speak thus?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.3">36.3</a> And the venerable &Acirc;nanda went up to the place where the Blessed One was: and when he had come there, he saluted the Blessed One, and took his seat on one side, and so sitting the venerable &Acirc;nanda spake to the Blessed One thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'This Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, Lord, is a very distinguished and well-known person. Great would be the efficacy<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn166" href="#n166">166</a>]</sup></span> of the adherence given by well-known persons like him to this doctrine and discipline. May the Blessed One be pleased so to act, that Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla shall become devoted to this doctrine and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Now that, &Acirc;nanda, is not a hard thing for the Tathāgata--so to act that Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla should become devoted to this doctrine and discipline.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.4">36.4</a> Then the Blessed One suffused Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla with the feeling of his love<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn167" href="#n167">167</a>]</sup></span>, and rising from his seat he entered into his dwelling-place. And Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, overcome by the Blessed One by the sense of his love, just as a young calf follows the kine, so did he go on from dwelling-place to dwelling-place, and from apartment to apartment, asking the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'Where then, Sirs, is that Blessed One dwelling now, the Arahat Buddha? For we desire to visit that Blessed One, the Arahat Buddha.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg137"><span class="f2 g"><b>[137]</b></span></a> 'This, friend, is his dwelling-place, the door of which is shut. Go up therefore quietly, and without crossing the threshould, enter into the verandah, and knock at the cross-bar. The Blessed One will open the door to thee.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.5">36.5</a> So Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla did so, and the Blessed One opened the door. And Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla entered into the dwelling-place, and saluted the Blessed One and took his seat on one side. And to Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla sitting there the Blessed One preached in due course: that is to say, he talked to him of giving; of moral conduct; of heaven; of the danger of vanity, of the corruption of lusts; and of the advantages of renunciation. When the Blessed One saw that the mind of Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla was prepared, impressible, free from obstacles to understanding the truth, elated, and believing, then he preached that which is the principal doctrine of the Buddhas, namely, Suffering, the Cause of suffering, the Cessation of suffering, and the Path. And just as a clean cloth, free from black specks, properly takes the dye, thus did Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, even while sitting there, obtain the pure and spotless eye of the truth (that is, the knowledge that), 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of beginning, that is subject also to the condition of cessation.' And Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, having seen the truth, having mastered the truth, having understood the truth, having penetrated the truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on no one else for knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, thus spake to the Blessed One:</p>

					<p class="f4">'May the venerable one be pleased, Lord, to <a id="pg138"><span class="f2 g"><b>[138]</b></span></a> receive from me alone, and not from others, the requisites of the Order: that is to say, robes, and food, and dwelling-places, and medicine for the use of the sick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Whosoever, Ro<i>g</i>a, with the knowledge of a disciple, and with the insight of a disciple<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn168" href="#n168">168</a>]</sup></span>, has perceived the Truth, even as thou hast, they also will think, "Oh! that the venerable ones would be pleased to receive from me alone, and not from others, the requisites of the order." Therefore, Ro<i>g</i>a, they shall receive them from you, indeed, but also from others.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.6">36.6</a> Now at that time a certain succession had been fixed, in which the inhabitants of Kusinārā should each in succession provide food for the Saṅgha. And it occurred to Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, who had not received a place in the succession, thus: What if I were to inspect the Saṅgha's storehouse, and provide whatever I found wanting in the storehouse?' And on inspecting the storehouse, he found there no potherbs, and no meal<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn169" href="#n169">169</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla went up to the place where the venerable &Acirc;nanda was, and when he had come there, he spake to the venerable &Acirc;nanda thus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'It occurred to me (&amp;&ccedil;., as before, down to:) and no meal. If, &Acirc;nanda, I were to provide potherbs and meal, would the Blessed One accept them at my hands?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.7">36.7</a> The venerable &Acirc;nanda told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg139"><span class="f2 g"><b>[139]</b></span></a> 'Very good, then, &Acirc;nanda. Let him provide them.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, then, Ro<i>g</i>a. Provide them accordingly.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla at the end of the night, after he had had a quantity of potherbs and meal made ready, offered them to the Blessed One, saying, 'May the Blessed One accept at my hands the potherbs and the meal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very good, then, Ro<i>g</i>a. Present them to the Bhikkhus.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The Bhikkhus, fearing to offend, did not accept them.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Accept them, O Bhikkhus, and make use of them.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p36.8">36.8</a> Then Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, with his own hand, offered to the company of the Bhikkhus with the Buddha at their head, and satisfied them with the potherbs and the meal. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his hands and the bowl, he (Ro<i>g</i>a) took his seat on one side. And when he was so seated the Blessed One taught, and incited, and conversed, and gladdened Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla with religious discourse. And Ro<i>g</i>a the Malla, when he had been taught, &amp;c., rose from his seat and departed thence.</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, on that occasion, and in that connection, when he had delivered a religious discourse, addressed the Bhikkhus, and said:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, all kinds of potherbs<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn170" href="#n170">170</a>]</sup></span>, and all kinds of meal<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn171" href="#n171">171</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p37.1">37.1</a> Now the Blessed One, when he had stayed at Kusinārā as long as he thought fit, went on, on his pilgrimage to &Acirc;tumā, with a great company of the Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus. And at that time there was dwelling at &Acirc;tumā a certain man, who had entered the Order in his old age, and who had previously been a barber<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn172" href="#n172">172</a>]</sup></span>.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p37.2">37.2</a> Now this dotard<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn176" href="#n176">176</a>]</sup></span> heard the news: 'The Blessed One, they say, is coming to &Acirc;tumā with <a id="pg141"><span class="f2 g"><b>[141]</b></span></a> a great company of the Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.' Then that dotard spake thus to his sons: 'They say the Blessed One is coming, my children<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn177" href="#n177">177</a>]</sup></span>, to &Acirc;tumā with a great company of Bhikkhus, with two hundred and fifty Bhikkhus.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p37.3">37.3</a> Very good, Father, said they, and (did so). And when people saw those young men, of pleasing appearance, and skilful in discourse, so acting, then even those who were not willing to be led into joining in the act were led to join in it; and being so led, they gave abundantly. So the young men collected a great quantity of salt, and oil; and rice, and meal.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p37.4">37.4</a> And the Blessed One in due course arrived in his journey at &Acirc;tumā; and there at &Acirc;tumā the Blessed One stayed at the Threshing floor.

					<p class="f4">Now the Tathāgatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tathāgatas put questions full of <a id="pg142"><span class="f2 g"><b>[142]</b></span></a> sense, not void of sense: to what is void of sense, the bridge is pulled down for the Tathāgatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions to the Bhikkhus--when they intend to preach the Truth, and when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn179" href="#n179">179</a>]</sup></span>. And the Blessed One spake thus to that dotard, 'Whence, O Bhikkhu, is this congey?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then that dotard informed the Blessed One of the whole matter.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p37.5">37.5</a> The Blessed Buddha rebuked him, saying, 'This is improper, O foolish one, not according to rule, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unbecoming, and ought not to be done. How can you, O foolish one, having gone forth (from the world into the Order), instigate others to do what is unlawful. This will not conduce, O foolish one, to the conversion of the unconverted.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when he had rebuked him, and had delivered a religious discourse, he addressed the Bhikkhus, and said: 'One who has gone forth ought not, O Bhikkhus, to instigate others to an unlawful act<span class="f1"><sup>[<a id="fn180" href="#n180">180</a>]</sup></span>.

And in due course, journeying straight on, he arrived at Sāvatthi, and there, at Sāvatthi, the Blessed One stayed in the &Acirc;rama of Anātha-pi<i>n</i><i>d</i>ika.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now at that time there was in Sāvatthi great abundance of solid food in the shape of fruits. And the question arose among the Bhikkhus, 'Has, now, the Blessed One permitted the use of fruits as solid food, or has he not?'</p>

Childers, following Subh&ucirc;ti's edition of the Abhidhānappad&icirc;pikā, spells both this word and the allied form Pippal&icirc; with pph instead of pp. So also Fausb&ouml;ll at <i>G</i>ātaka, vol. i, p. 29, verse 218.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> The correct spelling is probably sivā<i>t</i>ikā. B&ouml;htlingk-Roth under Sivā<i>t</i>ikā and Hiṅgu-<i>s</i>ivā<i>t</i>ikā say it is the same as Va<i>m</i><i>s</i>a-pattr&icirc;.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> Geruka is the Sanskrit gairika, ochre; and the kind meant is yellow ochre. Geruko nāma suva<i>n</i><i>n</i>a-geruko, says Buddhaghosa. Compare the Sanskrit Kā<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ana-gairika and svar<i>n</i>a-gairika.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> Read so in the text as corrected on p. 381. It is a kind of sandal wood.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> A perfume made from the grass of the same name (mentioned above, VI, 3).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Saṅkha-nābhi, the meaning of the latter part of which compound is not quite clear.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa has no comment on this. It may mean that the ointment boxes might be sewn either on to some place in the Vihāra, or on to some part of the Bhikkhu's dress. The latter is more in accordance with §4 below.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Natthu-kamma. In the commentary on the Dhammapada, pp. 83 and foll., there is an example of the way in which a physician administers medicinal oil in this manner to a sick Bhikkhu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> Natthu-kara<i>n</i>&icirc;, that is, an instrument to hold up the nose, so that the medicinal oil does not run out.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Yamaka-natthu-kara<i>n</i>&icirc;, that is, one that would go up both nostrils. The last sentence of §1 would come in better after this clause.</p>

A pit, six feet deep, is filled with charcoal, and covered with a coating of earth or sand. The leaves good for rheumatism are spread over the sand. The patient reposes on the leaves on the affected limb, which has been rubbed over with oil; and turns over and over until his whole body has been well steamed.</p>

Bhaṅga may here mean 'broken bits,' namely, of the leaves, just as sākhā-bhaṅga at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 158 means 'twig.' Compare uttari-bhaṅga, <i>G</i>ātaka I, 197, 349; Dhammapada 171; <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 4, 4; sar&icirc;ra-bhaṅga, Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 59; and bhaṅga alone at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 392; Mahāvagga I, 25, 10; Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' p. 241. For kudhita we should read kuthita.</p>

Compare Dhammapada, p.103.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Wise, p.176, says, 'The local accumulation of bad blood may be removed by means of cupping, which is performed by a horn, cut smooth and even at the large extremity, and with a small opening at the narrow end.' Compare Su<i>s</i>ruta, S&ucirc;trasthāna, chap. 27, and <i>S</i>ar&icirc;rasthāna, chap. 8 (at the end).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> This would seem to be a preventive remedy. Water may be kept ready, so that the incoming Bhikkhus may use it, and their feet therefore may not become blistered. But perhaps pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>a here means some curative application of water to the feet, such as cold water bandages, for example. Compresses (?poultices) are mentioned below (§5) for boils.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> Compare chapter 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains tila-kakka as ground sesamum seeds (pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ehi tilehi attho); but kalka is paste or salve. See Wise, p. 129.</p>

Of these, when neither the ārāma nor the dwellings are fenced in (parikkhittāni honti), that is an ārāma ox-stall; when all or some of the dwellings are fenced in, and not the ārāma, that is a vihāra ox-stall.

As kadali is the ordinary plantain or banana, which has no seeds, the meaning of the difference he makes between the two kinds is not clear. The expression eka<i>t</i><i>th</i>ithālapakka, at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 70, evidently rests on the same meaning of the word atthi, which there also cannot be, as usual, seed; for there is no such thing as a palmyra fruit with one seed.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup> §§7, 8 recur in the Sela Sutta (Sutta Nipāta, III, 7, 21, 22), where they stand in a much more appropriate context.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup> That is, the square kahāpa<i>n</i>as of copper or bronze, figured in the Bārhut has-reliefs, and mentioned in the Dhammapada. See Rh. D.'s 'Ancient Coins and Measures,' p. 4, §5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> Bahukato; only found in this passage. Buddhaghosa says, Nāha<i>m</i> bhante &Acirc;nanda bahukato ti nāham Buddhādi-gatapasāda-bahumānena idhāgato ti dasset&icirc; ti. Here Buddhādi means the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup> Mahiddhiyo, where, as so often elsewhere, Iddhi has no supernatural connotation. Compare the passages quoted above in our note on I, 15, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> Compare Rh. D., 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 112.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> Sekhena, as opposed to asekhena. That is, with the knowledge of one who is not himself an Arahat. See our note on Mahāvagga I, 7, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> See the note at the end; of §8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup> Sabba<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>a <i>t</i>ākan (sic) ti sappi-ād&icirc;hi pakka<i>m</i> vā apakka<i>m</i> vā yam ki<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>i <i>t</i>āka<i>m</i> (B.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup> Pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>a-khādaniyan ti pi<i>t</i><i>th</i>amaya<i>m</i> khādaniya<i>m</i> (B.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup> This man is identified by the tradition with the Subhadda mentioned in the accounts of the Great Decease, and of the First Council. See Rh. D.'s note on Mahā-parinibbāna Sutta VI, 40.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa understands this word, which he reads differently, as meaning 'sweet-voiced.' Ma<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>ukā (sic) ti madhura-va<i>k</i>anā. We follow the ordinary meaning of ma<i>ñ</i><i>g</i>u.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup> Here again Buddhaghosa gives a technical meaning to the word, unsupported by the derivation. He says, Pa<i>t</i>ibhāneyyakā ti sake sippe pa<i>t</i>ibhāna-sampannā. This agrees with Childers's rendering (sub voce) of <i>G</i>ātaka I, 60; but compare Sigālovādā Sutta, ed. Grimblot, p. 309.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n175" href="#fn175">175</a>]</sup> On the idiomatic phrase saka<i>m</i> ā<i>k</i>ariyaka<i>m,</i> compare Mahāparinibbāna Sutta III, 7, 8 (text ed. Childers, pp. 24 and following)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n176" href="#fn176">176</a>]</sup> Literally, 'this man who had gone forth (from the household state into the homeless life of the Order) in his old age.' But it is impossible to repeat this long phrase throughout the narrative as is done in the Pāli, where the meaning of the phrase is 'expressed by one compound. As the Pāli word vuddha-pabba<i>g</i>ito connotes contempt, and even censure (men entering the Order in their old age being often represented as incapable of appreciating even the simplest principles of the 'doctrine and discipline'), the use of the word 'dotard' in our translation seems to retain the spirit of the Pāli epithet, while avoiding the inconvenient length of a literal version.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n177" href="#fn177">177</a>]</sup> Tāta, not tātā. It will be seen that Childers is wrong in supposing that the plural form is always used when more than one person is addressed.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n178" href="#fn178">178</a>]</sup> Khura-bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i>; not 'shaving materials;' compare hatthi-bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>o and assa-bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>o at Mahāvagga I, 61, and below, §5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n179" href="#fn17">179</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga I, 31, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n180" href="#fn180">180</a>]</sup> Unlawful, because one Bhikkhu may not beg for others, and it is unlawful for those others to accept things thus procured.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n181" href="#fn181">181</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains the 'part' (bhāga<i>m</i>) as the twelfth part, which, he says, is in accordance with the ancient custom of India. Used absolutely, as in this passage, bhāga usually means 'half.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n182" href="#fn182">182</a>]</sup> The formal expressions referred to in these two paragraphs are precisely the expressions to which, in the Book of the Great Decease VI, 40, and in the <i>K</i>ullavagga XI, 1, r, Subhadda is stated to have taken such serious objection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n183" href="#fn183">183</a>]</sup> This refers to certain medicines; see Mahāvagga VI, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n184" href="#fn184">184</a>]</sup> This also refers to certain medicines; see the 23rd Nissaggiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n185" href="#fn185">185</a>]</sup> What this refers to is unknown to us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n186" href="#fn186">186</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that this holds good if the two are so mixed that the taste (rasu) has become one (sambhinna). If the two are not so mixed, then they may be divided, and the part allow-able during the longer period may be enjoyed up to the end of that period. See I, 20, 9; V, 2, 1; VI, 16, 3; VIII, I, 24, and the notes there.</p>
