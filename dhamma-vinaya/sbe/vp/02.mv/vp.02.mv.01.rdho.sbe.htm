					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:1">1.</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at <a id="page_74"><span class="f1 g">p. 74</span></a> Uruvel&#257;, on the bank of the river Nera<i>ñg</i>ar&#257;<a id="page_74_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> at the foot of the Bodhi tree (tree of wisdom), just after he had become SamBuddha.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:4">4.</a> Then the Blessed One during the middle watch of the night fixed his mind upon the Chain of Causation, in direct and reverse order: 'From Ignorance spring the sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras, &amp;c.

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:1">2.1</a> Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Bodhi tree to the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la banyan tree (banyan tree of the goat-herds<a id="page_79_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>). And when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la banyan tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:2">2.</a> Now a certain Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a, who was of a haughty disposition<a id="page_79_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he exchanged greeting with the Blessed One; having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, he stationed himself near him; then standing near him that Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a thus spoke to the Blessed One: 'By what, Gotama; does one become a Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a, and what are the characteristics that make a man a Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p2:3">3.</a> And the Blessed One, having heard that, on this occasion pronounced this solemn utterance: 'That Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a who has removed (from himself) all sinfulness, who is free from haughtiness, free from impurity, self-restrained, who is an accomplished master of knowledge (or, of the Veda), who has fulfilled the duties of holiness, such a Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a may <a id="page_80"><span class="f1 g">p. 80</span></a> justly call himself a Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>a, whose behaviour is uneven to nothing in the world.'</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the account of what passed under the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la tree.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:1">3.1</a> Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la banyan tree to the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree. And when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:2">2.</a> At that time a great cloud appeared out of season, rainy weather which lasted seven days, cold weather, storms, and darkness. And the N&#257;ga (or Serpent) king Mu<i>k</i>alinda came out from his abode, and seven times encircled the body of the Blessed One with his windings, and kept extending his large hood over the Blessed One's head, thinking to himself: 'May no coldness (touch) the Blessed One! May no heat (touch) the Blessed One! May no vexation by gadflies and gnats, by storms and sunheat and reptiles (touch) the Blessed One!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:3">3.</a> And at the end of those seven days, when the N&#257;ga king Mu<i>k</i>alinda saw the open, cloudless sky, he loosened his windings from the body of the Blessed One, made his own appearance disappear, created the appearance of a youth, and stationed himself in front of the Blessed One, raising his clasped hands, and paying reverence to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:4">4.</a> And the Blessed One, perceiving that, on this occasion, pronounced this solemn utterance: 'Happy is the solitude of him who is full of joy, who has learnt the Truth, who sees (the Truth). Happy is freedom from malice in this world, (self-)restraint towards all beings that have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this world, getting beyond all desires; the putting away of that pride which comes from the thought "I am!" This truly is the highest happiness!'</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the account of what passed under the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p4">4</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:1">4.1</a> Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Mu<i>k</i>alinda tree to the R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana (tree<a id="page_81_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn10" href="#n10">10</a>]</sup></span>); when he had reached it, he sat cross-legged at the foot of the R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:2">2.</a> At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants, came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that place. Then a deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relatian of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants <a id="pg82"><span class="f2 g"><b>[82]</b></span></a> Tapussa and Bhallika: 'Here, my noble friends, at the foot of the R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana tree, is staying the Blessed One, who has just become SamBuddha. Go and show your reverence to him, the Blessed One, by (offering him) rice-cakes and lumps of honey. Long will this be to you for a good and for a blessing.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:3">3.</a> And the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they stationed themselves near him; standing near him, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that that may long be to us for a good and for a blessing! </p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:4">4.</a> Then the Blessed One thought: 'The Tath&#257;gatas<a id="page_82_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn11" href="#n11">11</a>]</sup></span> do not accept (food) with their hands. Now <a id="page_83"><span class="f1 g">p. 83</span></a> with what shall I accept the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' Then the four Mah&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>a gods<a id="page_83_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn12" href="#n12">12</a>]</sup></span>, understanding by the power of their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the horizon) four bowls made of stone (saying), 'May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' The Blessed One accepted those new stone bowls; and therein be received the rice-cakes and honey lumps, and those, when he had received, he ate.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:5">5.</a> And Tapussa and Bhallika, the merchants, when they saw that the Blessed One had cleansed<a id="page_83_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn13" href="#n13">13</a>]</sup></span> his bowl and his hands, bowed down in reverence <a id="pg84"><span class="f2 g"><b>[84]</b></span></a> at the feet of the Blessed One and thus addressed the Blessed One: 'We take our refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One and in the Dhamma; may the Blessed One receive us as disciples who, from this day forth while our life lasts, have taken their refuge (in him).' These were the first in the world to become lay-disciples (of the Buddha) by the formula which contained (only) the dyad<a id="page_84_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn14" href="#n14">14</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the account of what passed under the R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana tree.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p5">5</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:1">5.1</a> Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana tree to the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la banyan tree. And when he had reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of the A<i>g</i>ap&#257;la banyan tree.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:2">2.</a> Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose: 'I have penetrated this doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted, which is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the wise. This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who <a id="pg85"><span class="f2 g"><b>[85]</b></span></a> are given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire, the law of causality and the chain of causation will be a matter difficult to understand; most difficult for them to understand will be also the extinction of all sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras, the getting rid of all the substrata (of existence<a id="page_85_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn15" href="#n15">15</a>]</sup></span>), the destruction of desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirv&#257;<i>n</i>a! Now if I proclaim the doctrine, and other men are not able to understand my preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:3">3.</a> And then the following . . . .<a id="page_85_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn16" href="#n16">16</a>]</sup></span> stanzas, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One: 'With great pains have I acquired it. Enough! why should I now proclaim it? This doctrine will not be easy to understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness, they will not see what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound, difficult to perceive, and subtle.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:4">4.</a> When the Blessed One pondered over this matter, his mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine. Then Brahm&#257; <a id="pg86"><span class="f2 g"><b>[86]</b></span></a> Sahampati<a id="page_86_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn17" href="#n17">17</a>]</sup></span>, understanding by the power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, thought: 'Alas! the world perishes! Alas! the world is destroyed! if the mind of the Tath&#257;gata, of the holy, of the absolute SamBuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:5">5.</a> Then Brahm&#257; Sahampati disappeared from Brahma's world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly) as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his out-stretched arm.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:6">6.</a> And Brahm&#257; Sahampati adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine! may the perfect One preach the doctrine! there are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the doctrine, they cannot attain salvation. These will understand the doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:7">7.</a> Thus spoke Brahm&#257; Sahampati; and when he had thus spoken, he further said: 'The Dhamma hitherto manifested in the country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men. But do thou now open the door of the Immortal<a id="page_86_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn18" href="#n18">18</a>]</sup></span>; let them hear the doctrine discovered by the spotless One!</p>

					<p class="f4">'As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's <a id="pg87"><span class="f2 g"><b>[87]</b></span></a> top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O wise One, ascending to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing One, upon the people lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay, — thou, who hast freed thyself from suffering!</p>

					<p class="f4">'Arise, O hero; O victorious One! Wander through the world, O leader of the pilgrim band, who thyself art free from debt. May the Blessed One preach the doctrine; there will be people who can understand it!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:8">8.</a> When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to Brahm&#257; Sahampati: 'The following thought, Brahm&#257;, has occurred to me: "I have penetrated this doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of § 2)." And also, Brahm&#257;, the following . . . .<a id="page_87_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn19" href="#n19">19</a>]</sup></span> stanzas have presented themselves to my mind, which had not been heard (by me) before: "With great pains, . . . . (&amp;c., down to end of § 3)." When I pondered over this matter, Brahm&#257;, my mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:9">9.</a> And a second time Brahm&#257; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as in §§ 6, 7).' And for the second time the Blessed One said to Brahm&#257; Sahampati: 'The following thought . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:10">10.</a> And a third time Brahm&#257; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, may the Blessed One preach the doctrine, . . . . (&amp;c., as before).'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Blessed One, when he had heard Brahm&#257;'s solicitation, looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over the world, with his (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha, <a id="pg88"><span class="f2 g"><b>[88]</b></span></a> saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings whose eyes were covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of sense, of good disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some of them seeing the dangers of future life and of sin.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:11">11.</a> As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge over the water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, reach to the surface of the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, stand emerging out of the water, and the water does not touch them, — </p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:12">12.</a> Thus the Blessed One, looking over the world with his eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened, . . . . (&amp;c., the text repeats § 10); and when he had thus seen them, he addressed Brahm&#257; Sahampati in the following stanza: 'Wide opened is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let them send forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not, Brahm&#257;, despairing of the weary task, to men.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:13">13.</a> Then Brahm&#257; Sahampati understood: 'The Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the doctrine.' And he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his right side towards him; and then he straightway disappeared.</p>

					<p class="f4 ctr">Here ends the story of Brahm&#257;'s request.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p6">6</a></h4>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:1">6.1</a> Now the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?' And the Blessed One thought: 'There is &#256;<i>l</i>&#257;ra K&#257;l&#257;ma<a id="page_89_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn20" href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>; he is clever, wise, and learned; long since have the eye of his mind been darkened by scarcely any dust. What if I were to preach the doctrine first to &#256;<i>l</i>&#257;ra K&#257;l&#257;ma? He will easily understand this doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:2">2.</a> Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed One: '&#256;<i>l</i>&#257;ra K&#257;l&#257;ma has died, Lord, seven days ago.' And knowledge sprang up in the Blessed One's mind that &#256;<i>l</i>&#257;ra K&#257;l&#257;ma had died seven days ago. And the Blessed One thought: 'Highly noble was &#256;<i>l</i>&#257;ra K&#257;l&#257;ma. If he had heard my doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:3">3.</a> Then the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?' And the Blessed One thought: 'There is Uddaka R&#257;maputta<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n20">20</a>]</sup></span>; he is clever, wise, and learned; long since have the eye or his mind been darkened by scarcely any dust. What if I were to preach the doctrine first to Uddaka R&#257;maputta? He will easily understand this doctrine.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:4">4.</a> Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed One: 'Uddaka R&#257;maputta has died, Lord, yesterday evening.' And knowledge arose in the Blessed One's mind that Uddaka R&#257;maputta had died the previous evening. And the Blessed One thought: <a id="pg90"><span class="f2 g"><b>[90]</b></span></a> 'Highly noble was Uddaka R&#257;maputta. If he had heard my doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:5">5.</a> Then the Blessed One thought: 'To whom shall I preach the doctrine first? Who will understand this doctrine easily?' And the Blessed One thought: 'The five Bhikkhus<a id="page_90_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn21" href="#n21">21</a>]</sup></span> have done many services to me<a id="page_90_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn22" href="#n22">22</a>]</sup></span>; they attended on me during the time of my exertions (to attain sanctification by undergoing austerities). What if I were to preach the doctrine first to the five Bhikkhus?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:6">6.</a> Now the Blessed One thought: 'Where do the five Bhikkhus dwell now?' And the Blessed One saw by the power of his divine, clear vision, surpassing that of men, that the five Bhikkhus were living at Benares, in the deer park Isipatana<a id="page_90_fr_3"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn23" href="#n23">23</a>]</sup></span>. And the Blessed One, after having remained at Uruvel&#257; as long as he thought fit, went forth to Benares.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:7">7.</a> Now Upaka, a man belonging to the &#256;<i>g</i>îvaka sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling on the road, between Gay&#257; and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Your countenance, friend, is serene; your complexion is pure and bright. In whose <a id="pg91"><span class="f2 g"><b>[91]</b></span></a> name, friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose doctrine do you profess?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p6:8">8.</a> When Upaka the &#256;<i>g</i>îvaka had spoken thus, the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: 'I have overcome all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire. Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being is like me.

He had three palaces, one for winter, one for summer, one for the rainy season. In the palace for the rainy season he lived during the four months (of that season), surrounded with female musicians among whom no <a id="page_103"><span class="f1 g">p. 103</span></a> man was, and he did not descend from that palace (all that time). Now one day Yasa, the noble youth, who was endowed with, and possessed of the five pleasures of sense<a id="page_103_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn42" href="#n42">42</a>]</sup></span>, while he was attended (by those female musicians), fell asleep sooner than usual; and after him his attendants also fell asleep. Now an oil lamp was burning through the whole night.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:2">2.</a> And Yasa, the noble youth, awoke sooner than usual; and he saw his attendants sleeping; one had her lute leaning against her arm-pit; one had her tabor leaning against her neck; one had her drum leaning against her arm-pit; one had dishevelled hair; one had saliva flowing from her mouth; and they were muttering in their sleep. One would think it was a cemetery one had fallen into<a id="page_103_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn43" href="#n43">43</a>]</sup></span>. When he saw that, the evils (of the life he led) manifested themselves to him; his mind became weary (of worldly pleasures). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance to this solemn exclamation: 'Alas! what distress; alas! what danger!'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:3">3.</a> And Yasa, the noble youth, put on his gilt slippers, and went to the gate of his house. Non-human beings opened the gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's leaving the world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa, the noble youth, went to the gate of the city. Non-human beings opened the gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's leaving the world, and going forth into the houseless state. And Yasa, the noble youth, went to the deer park Isipatana.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:4">4.</a> At that time the Blessed One, having arisen in the night, at dawn was walking up and down in the open air. And the Blessed One saw Yasa, the noble youth, coming from afar. And when he saw him, he left the place where he was walking, and sat down on a seat laid out (for him). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance near the Blessed One to that solemn exclamation: 'Alas! what distress; alas! what danger!' And the Blessed One said to Yasa, the noble youth: 'Here is no distress, Yasa, here is no danger. Come here, Yasa, sit down; I will teach you the Truth (Dhamma).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:5">5.</a> And Yasa, the noble youth, when he heard that there was no distress, and that there was no danger, became glad and joyful; and he put off his gilt slippers, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him. When Yasa, the noble youth, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course: that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, about the duties of morality, about heaven, about the evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness of desires, and about the blessings of the abandonment of desire<a id="page_104_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn44" href="#n44">44</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:6">6.</a> When the Blessed One saw that the mind of Yasa, the noble youth, was prepared, impressible, free from obstacles (to understanding the Truth), elated, and believing, then he preached what is the principal doctrine of the Buddhas, namely, Suffering, <a id="page_105"><span class="f1 g">p. 105</span></a> the Cause of stiffering, the Cessation of suffering, the Path. Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject also to the condition of cessation.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:7">7.</a> Now the mother of Yasa, the noble youth, having gone up to his palace, did not see Yasa, the noble youth, and she went to the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder (her husband), and having approached him, she said to the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder: 'Your son Yasa, O householder, has disappeared.' Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, sent messengers on horseback to the four quarters of the horizon; and he went himself to the deer park Isipatana. Then the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, saw on the ground the marks of the gilt slippers; and when he saw them, he followed them up.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:8">8.</a> And the Blessed One saw the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, coming from afar. On seeing him, he thought: 'What if I were to effect such an exercise of miraculous power, that the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa, the noble youth, who is sitting here also.' And the Blessed One effected such an exercise of his miraculous power.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:9">9.</a> And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, he said to the Blessed One: 'Pray, Lord, has the Blessed One seen Yasa, the noble youth?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, who thought: 'Indeed, sitting here I shall see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also I became glad and joyful, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p7:10">10.</a> When the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, was sitting near him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course; that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, . . . .

And the se<i>tth</i>i, the householder, having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: 'Glorious, Lord! glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed One preached the doctrine in many ways.

Then the Blessed One thought: 'Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered to his father, has contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the &#257;savas.

Of Him the blessed Gotama such a glorious fame is spread abroad: "Truly he is the blessed, holy, absolute SamBuddha, endowed with knowledge and conduct, the most happy One, who understands all worlds, the highest One, who guides men as a driver curbs a bullock, the teacher of gods and men, the blessed Buddha.

And of those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders some also respectfully saluted the Blessed One and sat down near him; some exchanged greeting with the Blessed One, having exchanged with him greeting and complaisant words, they sat down near him; some bent their clasped hands towards the Blessed One and sat down near him; some shouted out their name and their family name before the Blessed One and sat down near him; some silently sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:4">4.</a> Now those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders thought: 'How now is this? has the great Sama<i>n</i>a placed himself under the spiritual direction of Uruvel&#257; Kassapa, or has Uruvel&#257; Kassapa placed himself under the spiritual direction of the great Sama<i>n</i>a?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection which had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders, addressed the venerable Uruvel&#257; Kassapa <a id="page_138"><span class="f1 g">p. 138</span></a> in this stanza: 'What knowledge have you gained, O inhabitant of Uruvel&#257;, that has induced you, who were renowned for your penances<a id="page_138_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn75" href="#n75">75</a>]</sup></span>, to forsake your sacred fire? I ask you, Kassapa, this question: How is it that your fire sacrifice has become deserted?'</p>

					<p class="f4">(Kassapa replied): 'It is visible things and sounds, and also tastes, pleasures and woman that the sacrifices speak of<a id="page_138_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn76" href="#n76">76</a>]</sup></span>; because I understood that whatever belongs to existence<a id="page_138_fr_3"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn77" href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span> is filth, therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings<a id="page_138_fr_4"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn78" href="#n78">78</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(Kassapa replied): 'I have seen the state of peace (i.e. Nirv&#257;<i>n</i>a) in which the basis of existence (upadhi<span class="f3"><sup>[<a href="#n77">77</a>]</sup></span>) and the obstacles to perfection <a id="page_139"><span class="f1 g">p. 139</span></a> (ki<i>ñk</i>ana<a id="page_139_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn81" href="#n81">81</a>]</sup></span>) have ceased, which is free from attachment to sensual existence, which cannot pass over into another state, which cannot be led to another state; therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:6">6.</a> Then the venerable Uruvel&#257; Kassapa rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, prostrated himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am his pupil; my teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am his pupil.' Then those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders understood: 'Uruvel&#257; Kassapa has placed himself under the spiritual direction of the great Sama<i>n</i>a.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:7">7., 8.</a><a id="p22:8"></a> And the Blessed One, who understood in his mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders, preached to them in due course (&amp;c., as in chap. 7, §§ 5, 6, down to:). Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus eleven myriads of those Magadha Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as and householders with Bimbis&#257;ra at their head, while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless Eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): 'Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject <a id="page_140"><span class="f1 g">p. 140</span></a> also to the condition of cessation.' One myriad announced their having become lay-pupils.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:9">9.</a> Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra, having seen the Truth (&amp;c. . . . . down to) dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the Teacher's doctrine, said to the Blessed One: 'In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I entertained five wishes; these are fulfilled now. In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I wished: "O that I might be inaugurated as king." This was my first wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might then the holy, absolute SamBuddha come into my kingdom." This was my second wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:10">10.</a> '"And might I pay my respects to Him, the Blessed One." This was my third wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might He the Blessed One preach his doctrine (Dhamma) to me." This was my fourth wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. "And might I understand His, the Blessed One's doctrine." This was my fifth wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now. These were the five wishes, Lord, which I entertalned in former days when I was a prince; these are fulfilled now.</p>

					<p class="f4">The Blessed One expressed his consent by remaining silent.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:12">12.</a> Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra, when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and, passing round him with his right side towards him, went away. <a id="page_141"><span class="f1 g">p. 141</span></a> And when the night had elapsed, the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra ordered excellent food, both hard and soft, to be prepared, and had dinner-time announced to the Blessed One in the words: 'It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.' And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on his under-robes, took his alms-bowl, and with his <i>k</i>îvara on entered the city of R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha accompanied by a great number of Bhikkhus, by one thousand Bhikkhus who all had been <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas before.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:13">13.</a> At that time Sakka the king of the devas, assuming the appearance of a young Br&#257;hman, walked in front of the Bhikkhu fraternity with Buddha at its head, singing the following stanzas: 'The self-controlled One with the self-controlled, with the former <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, the released One with the released, the Blessed One, gold-coloured like an ornament of si<u>n</u>gî gold<a id="page_141_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn82" href="#n82">82</a>]</sup></span>, has entered R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha.</p>

					<p class="f4">'He who is possessed of the ten Noble States<a id="page_141_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn83" href="#n83">83</a>]</sup></span> <a id="page_142"><span class="f1 g">p. 142</span></a> and of the ten Powers<a id="page_142_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn84" href="#n84">84</a>]</sup></span>, who understands the ten Paths of Kamma<a id="page_142_fr_2"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn85" href="#n85">85</a>]</sup></span> and possesses the ten (attributes of Arahatship)<a id="page_142_fr_3"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn86" href="#n86">86</a>]</sup></span>, the Blessed One, surrounded by ten hundred of followers, has entered R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:14">14.</a> The people when they saw Sakka the king of the devas, said: 'This youth indeed is handsome; this youth indeed has a lovely appearance; this youth indeed is pleasing. Whose attendant may this youth be?'</p>

					<p class="f4">When they talked thus, Sakka the king of the devas addressed those people in this stanza: 'He who is wise, entirely self-controlled, the unrivalled Buddha, tie Arahat, the most happy upon earth: his attendant am I.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:15">15.</a> And the Blessed One went to the palace of the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra. Having gone there, he sat down with the Bhikkhus who followed him, on seats laid out for them. Then the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra with his own hands served and offered excellent food, both hard and soft, to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at <a id="page_143"><span class="f1 g">p. 143</span></a> its head; and when the Blessed One had finished his meal and cleansed his bowl and his hands, he sat down near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:16">16.</a> Sitting near him the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra thought: 'Where may I find a place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible for all people who want (to see him), by day not too crowded, at night not exposed to much noise and alarm, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:17">17.</a> And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra thought: 'There is the Ve<i>l</i>uvana<a id="page_143_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn87" href="#n87">87</a>]</sup></span>, my pleasure garden, which is not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, . . . . (&amp;c., down to a retired life). What if I were to make an offering of the Ve<i>l</i>uvana pleasure garden to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p22:18">18.</a> And the Magadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra took a golden vessel (with water in it, to be poured over the Buddha's hand); and dedicated (the garden) to the Blessed One (by saying), 'I give up this Ve<i>l</i>uvana pleasure garden, Lord, to the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head.' The Blessed One accepted the &#257;r&#257;ma (park). Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated, and gladdened the Magadha king Seniya <a id="page_144"><span class="f1 g">p. 144</span></a> Bimbis&#257;ra by religious discourse, rose from his seat and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I allow you, O Bhikkhus, to receive the donation of an &#257;r&#257;ma (a park).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p24:4">4.</a> Then S&#257;riputta and Moggall&#257;na went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him, they prostrated thernselves, inclining their heads to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, let us receive the pabba<i>gg</i>&#257; and upasampad&#257; ordinations from the Blessed One.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Come, O Bhikkhus,' said the Blessed One, 'well taught is the doctrine; lead a holy life for the sake of the complete extinction of suffering.' Thus these venerable persons received the upasampad&#257; ordination.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p24:5">5.</a> At that time many distinguished young Magadha noblemen led a religious life under the direction of the Blessed One. The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'The Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes fathers to beget no sons; the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes wives to become widows; the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama causes families to become extinct. Now he has ordained one thousand <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas, and he has ordained these two hundred and fifty paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas who were followers of Sa<i>ñg</i>aya; and these many distingtiished young Magadha noblemen are now leading a religious life under the direction of the Sama<i>n</i>a Gotama.' And moreover, when they saw the Bhikkhus, they reviled them in the following stanza: 'The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come to Giribba<i>g</i>a (i.e. R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha) of the Magadha people, leading with hi in all the follawers of Sa<i>ñg</i>aya; who will be the next to be led by him?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p24:6">6.</a> Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were <a id="page_151"><span class="f1 g">p. 151</span></a> annoyed, murmured, and had hecome angry; these Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. (He replied): 'This noise, O Bhikkhus, will not last long; it will last only seven days; after seven days it will he over. And if they revile you, O Bhikkhus, in this stanza: "The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come, &amp;c.," you should reply to the revilers in the following stanza: "It is by means of the true doctrine that the great heroes, the Tath&#257;gatas, lead men. Who will murmur at the wise, who lead men by the power of the Truth?"'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p24:7">7.</a> At that time the people, when seeing the Bhikkhus, reviled them in the following stanza: 'The great Sama<i>n</i>a has come, &amp;c.' Then the Bhikkhus replied to the revilers in the following stanza: 'It is by means of the true doctrine, &amp;c.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the people understood: 'It is by truth, and not by wrong, that the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as lead men;' and thus that noise lasted only seven days, and after seven days it was over.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:1">1.</a> At that time some Bhikkhus, as they had no upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas (preceptors) and received no exhortation <a id="page_152"><span class="f1 g">p. 152</span></a> and instruction, went on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments (or, wearing their under and upper garments improperly), and in an improper attire. While people were eating, they held out their alms-bowls in which were leavings of food<a id="page_152_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn96" href="#n96">96</a>]</sup></span>, over the hard food (which the people were eating), and held them out over soft food, and held them out over savoury food, and held them out over drinks. They asked for soup and boiled rice themselves, and ate it; in the dining halls they made a great and loud noise.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:2">2.</a> The people were annoyed, murmured, and became angry (saying), 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as go on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments, . . . .

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:3">3.</a> Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry. Those Bhikkhus who were moderate, frugal, modest, conscientious, <a id="page_153"><span class="f1 g">p. 153</span></a> anxious for training, were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Bhikkhus go on their rounds for alms wearing improper under and upper garments, &amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:4">4.</a> These Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, having ordered the fraternity of Bhikkhus to assemble, questioned the Bhikkhus: 'Is it true, O Bhikkhus, that some Bhikkhus go on their rounds, . . . . (&amp;c., down to), that they make a great and loud noise in the dining halls?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, Lord.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:5">5.</a> Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked those Bhikkhus: 'It is improper, O Bhikkhus, what these foolish persons are doing, it is unbecoming, indecent, un worthy of Sama<i>n</i>as, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can these foolish persons, O Bhikkhus, go on their rounds, &amp;c.? How can they make so great and loud a noise in the dining halls? This will not do, O Bhikkhus, for converting the unconverted, and for augmenting the number of the converted; but it will result, O Bhikkhus, in the unconverted being repulsed (from the faith), and in many of the converted being estranged.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:6">6.</a> And the Blessed One rebuked those Bhikkhus in many ways, spoke against unfrugality, ill-nature, immoderation, insatiableness, delighting in society, and indolence; spoke in many ways in praise of frugality, good-nature, of the moderate, contented, who have eradicated (sin), who have shaken off (sin), of the gracious, of the reverent, and of the energetic. And having delivered beforethe Bhikkhus a religious <a id="page_154"><span class="f1 g">p. 154</span></a> discourse in accordance to, and in conformity with these subjects, he thus addressed the Bhikkhus:</p>

					<p class="f4">'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, (that young Bhikkhus choose) an upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya (or preceptor).</p>

Thus these two, united by mutual reverence, confidence, and communion of life, will progress, advance, and reach a high stage in this doctrine and discipline.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p25:7">7.</a> 'And let them choose, O Bhikkhus, an upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya in this way: Let him (who is going to choose an upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya) adjust his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, salute the feet (of the intended upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya), sit down squatting, raise his joined hands, and say: "Venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya; venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya; venerable Sir, be my upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya." (If the other answer): "Well," or, "Certainly," or, "Good," or, "All right," or, "Carry on (your work) with friendliness (towards me)," or should he express this by gesture (lit. by his body). or by word, or by gesture and word, then the upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya has been chosen.

The Tath&#257;gatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask, and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tath&#257;gatas put questions full of sense, not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the Tath&#257;gatas. For two purposes the blessed Buddhas put questions to the Bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the doctrine or when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p31:5">5.</a> And the Blessed One said to the venerable Upananda Va<u>n</u>gantaputta: 'How many years have you completed, O Bhikkhu, since your upasampad&#257;?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the blessed Buddha rebuked him: 'This is improper, O foolish one, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of a Sama<i>n</i>a, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O foolish one, who ought to receive exhortation and instruction from others, think yourself fit for administering exhortation and instruction to another Bhikkhu? Too quickly, O foolish one, have you abandoned yourself to the ambition of collecting followers. This will not do (&amp;c.: as in chap. 30. 3). Let no one, O Bhikkhus, confer the upasampad&#257; ordination who has not <a id="page_177"><span class="f1 g">p. 177</span></a> completed ten years.

And a certain Bhikkhu who had formerly belonged to a Titthiya school, when his upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya remonstrated with him (on certain offences) according to the Dhamma, brought his upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya (by reasoning) to silence and went back to that same Titthiya school<a id="page_177_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn130" href="#n130">130</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

(Thus) ignorant upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas are found and clever saddhivih&#257;rikas (&amp;c., down to:), foolish upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas are found and wise saddhivih&#257;rikas.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="demi" />

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> To this book is prefixed, as introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's attaining Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples, S&#257;riputta and Moggall&#257;na (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical or legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka, the discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account occupies by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For it contains the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably, for ever, of what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of their Master's life in its most important period.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The connection in which this legendary narration stands with the main subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to account for. The regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity, which are discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves to the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>aka as being the very basis of their religious discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence of the Saŋgha without the P&#257;timokkha rules, or without the regulations about the Pav&#257;ra<i>n</i>&#257; festival, but it was impossible to realise the idea of a Saŋgha without rules showing who was to be regarded as a duly admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not. It is quite natural, therefore, that the stories or legends concerning the ordination of Bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the very first events of the history of the Saŋgha. Nor is it difficult to account for the theory formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law, of different successive forms in which the ordination of Bhikkhus had been performed. In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the Buddha himself who could ordain Bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be received, expressed their wish, and he conferred on them the pabba<i>gg</i>&#257; and upasampad&#257; ordinations by the formula: 'Ehi bhikkhu,' &amp;c. (see I, 6, 32, 34, &amp;c.) It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the Saŋgha grew larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of admitting new members to the Bhikkhus themselves, and should have instituted that form of ordination which the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>aka found valid at their own time.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The transition, however, from the supposed oldest form of ordination (the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampad&#257;) to that latter form is in the Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There is described an intermediate stage between the two, the ordination by the three sara<i>n</i>agamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated declaration of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha (see Mah&#257;vagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka to this construction, was most probably the important part which in the upasampad&#257; service of the later time devolved upon the preceptor (upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya) of the candidate. As only learned Bhikkhus, who had completed the tenth year after their own upasampad&#257;, could perform the function of upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya at the upasampad&#257; ordination of other Bhikkhus (Mah&#257;vagga I, 31, 8), it was natural that the redactors of the Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form of upasampad&#257; service to the first times of Buddha's teaching. For these times, therefore, they recorded another form, the upasampad&#257; by the three sara<i>n</i>agamanas, the introduction of which they assigned, very naturally, to the time soon after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by which event the number of Bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven to sixty-one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> The Lilayan or Phalgu river in Behar; see General Cunningham's map, Archaeological Reports, vol. i. plate iii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> After having reached the sambodhi and before preaching to the world the truth he has acquired, the Buddha remains, according to the tradition, during some weeks at Uruvel&#257;, 'enjoying the bliss of emancipation.' The Mah&#257;vagga, which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on the Mah&#257;vagga; <i>G</i>&#257;taka Atthav. vol. i. p. 77 seq.; Dîpava<i>m</i>sa I, 29, 30; Lalita Vistara, p. 488 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 236 seq., &amp;c.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> The Chain of Causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nid&#257;nas (causes of existence), contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer to the same problem to which the second and third of the four Noble Truths (ariyasa<i>kk</i>a) also try to give a solution, viz. the problem of the origin and destruction of suffering. The Noble Truths simply reduce the origin of suffering to Thirst, or Desire (Ta<i>n</i>h&#257;), in its threefold form, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity (see I, 6, 20). In the system of the twelve nid&#257;nas Thirst also has found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted between to<i>n</i>h&#257; and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the investigation of causes is carried on further beyond to<i>n</i>h&#257;. The question is here asked, What does to<i>n</i>h&#257; come from? and thus the series of causes and effects is led back to avigg&#257; (Ignorance), as its deepest root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi<i>t</i>akas, who of course could not but observe this parallelity between the second and third ariyasa<i>kk</i>as and the system of the twelve nid&#257;nas, go so far, in one instance (A<u>n</u>guttara-Nik&#257;ya, Tika-Nip&#257;ta, fol. <i>k</i>e of the Phayre MS.), as to directly replace, in giving the text of the four ariyasa<i>kk</i>as, the second and third of them by the twelve nid&#257;nas, in direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished a valuable note on the nid&#257;nas; see Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays (second edition), II, 453 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> In the Samm&#257;di<i>tth</i>isuttanta (Ma<i>ggh</i>ima-Nik&#257;ya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) we find the following explanation of what Ignorance is: 'Not to know Suffering, not to know the Cause of suffering, not to know the Cessation of suffering, not to know the Path which leads to the cessation of suffering, this is called Ignorance.' The same is repeated in the explanation of the nid&#257;na formula, which is given in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka, Pa<i>t</i>i<i>kk</i>asamupp&#257;da-vibha<u>n</u>ga, fol. <i>k</i>i of the Phayre MS.), and we must accept it, therefore, as the authentic expression of Buddhistical belief. It is obvious, however, that this explanation leaves room for another question. Ignorance, we are told, is the source of all evil and of all suffering, and the subject ignored is stated to be the four Truths. But who is the subject that ignores them? All attributes (as the vi<i>ññ</i>&#257;<i>n</i>a, &amp;c.), that constitute sentient beings and enable them to know or to ignore, are said to be first produced by Ignorance, and we shou1d conclude, therefore, that they cannot exist before Ignorance has begun to act. Or are we to understand that it is the Ignorance incurred by a sentient being in a preceding existence, that causes the sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras and Consciousness, the connecting links between the different existences, to act and to bring about the birth of a new being?</p>

					<p class="lgqt">As is well known, this Ignorance (Avidy&#257;) plays a great part also in the Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no doubt, founded to a considerable extent on older theories. But we cannot venture in a note to touch upon one of the most difficult and interesting questions which await the research of Indianists.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> It is very frequently stated that there are three sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras or productions: k&#257;yasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra, va<i>k</i>isa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra, and <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra, or, productions of body, of speech, and of thought (see, for instance, the Samm&#257;di<i>tth</i>isuttanta, Ma<i>ggh</i>ima-Nik&#257;ya, fol. khû of Turnour's MS.) The k&#257;yasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra consists, according to the Sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra-Yamaka (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka), in inhalation and expiration (ass&#257;sapass&#257;s&#257;); the va<i>k</i>îsa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra in attention and investigation (vitakkavi<i>k</i>&#257;r&#257;); the <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra in ideas, sensations, and all attributes of mind except attention and investigation (sa<i>ññ</i>&#257; <i>k</i>a vedan&#257; <i>k</i>a <i>th</i>apetv&#257; vitakkavi<i>k</i>&#257;re sabbe pi <i>k</i>ittasampayuttak&#257; dhamm&#257;). The Vibha<u>n</u>ga (Abhidhamma-Pi<i>t</i>aka, Pa<i>t</i>i<i>kk</i>asamupp&#257;davibha<u>n</u>ga, I.I.{sic. ?}) gives, when discussing the sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras, six categories instead of the three: 'Now which are the sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras that are produced by Ignorance? Sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras (or, productions) that lead to righteousness, sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras that lead to sinfulness, sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras that lead to immovability, productions of body, of speech, and of thought.' The P&#257;li words are: 'Tattha katame avi<i>gg</i>&#257;pa<i>kk</i>ay&#257; sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;r&#257;? pu<i>ññ</i>&#257;bhisa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro apu<i>ññ</i>&#257;bhisa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro &#257;<i>n</i>a<i>ñg</i>&#257;bhisa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro k&#257;yasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro va<i>k</i>isa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro <i>k</i>ittasa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ro.' The list of fifty-five categories belonging to the sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra-khandha, which Sp. Hardy gives in his Manual (p. 404 seq.; comp. also Rh. D., 'Buddhism,' p. 91 seq., and 'Buddhist Suttas from the P&#257;li,' p. 242), is not founded, as far as we know, on the authority of the Pi<i>t</i>akas themselves, but on later compendia and commentaries.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> I.e. eye, ear, nose, tongue, body (or the faculty of touch), and mind.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: 'The goat-herds used to go to the shadow of that banyan tree and to sit there; therefore it was called the banyan tree of the goat-herds.' The northern Buddhists say that this tree had been planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta's six years' penance, in order to shelter him; see Beal, Rom. Legend, pp. 192, 238, and the Mah&#257;vastu.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> 'Huhu<u>n</u>ka<i>g</i>&#257;tiko.' Buddhaghosa: 'Because he was di<i>tth</i>ama<u>n</u>galika, he became filled with haughtiness and wrath, and went about uttering the sound "huhu<i>m</i>."' Di<i>tth</i>ama<u>n</u>galika (having seen something auspicious ?) is obscure to us.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that R&#257;<i>g</i>&#257;yatana (lit. a royal apartment) was the name of a tree. It is the same tree which in the Lalita Vistara (p. 493, ed. Calcutta) is called T&#257;r&#257;ya<i>n</i>a, and in the Dipava<i>m</i>sa (II, 50) Khîrap&#257;la. The place where the two merchants met Buddha, is thus described in the Mah&#257;vastu: kshîri-k&#257;vanasha<i>nd</i>e bahudevatake <i>k</i>etiye.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> The term Tath&#257;gata is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied to Samm&#257;samBuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi<i>t</i>akas when the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person as 'the Tath&#257;gata.' The meaning 'sentient being,' which is given to the word in the Abhidh&#257;nappadîpik&#257;, and in Childers's Dictionary, is not confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the Pi<i>t</i>akas. This translation of the word is very possibly based merely on a misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi<i>t</i>aka: hoti tath&#257;gato para<i>m</i> mara<i>n</i>&#257;, which means, of course, 'does a Buddha exist after death?' In the <i>G</i>aina books we sometimes find the term tatthagaya (tatragata), 'he who has attained that world, i.e. emancipation,' applied to the <i>G</i>inas as opposed to other beings who are called ihagaya (idhagata), 'living in this world.' See, for instance, the <i>G</i>ina<i>k</i>aritra, § 16. Considering the close relation in which most of the dogmatical terms of the <i>G</i>ainas stand to those of the Bauddhas, it is difficult to believe that tath&#257;gata and tatthagaya should not originally have conveyed very similar ideas. We think that on the long way from the original M&#257;gadhî to the P&#257;li and Sanskrit, the term tatthagata or tatth&#257;gata (tatra + &#257;gata), 'he who has arrived there, i.e. at emancipation,' may very easily have undergone the change into tath&#257;gata, which would have made it unintelligible, were we not able to compare its unaltered form as preserved by the <i>G</i>ainas.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> The four guardian gods of the quarters of the world; see Hardy's Manual, p. 24. Their P&#257;li names, as given in the Abhidh&#257;nappadîpik&#257;, vv. 31, 32, the Dîpava<i>m</i>sa XVI, 12, &amp;c., were, Dhatara<i>tth</i>a, Virû<i>Ih</i>aka, Virûpakkha, and Vessava<i>n</i>a or Kuvera.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> Onîtapattap&#257;<i>n</i>i, which is said very frequently of a person who has finished his meal, is translated by Childers, 'whose hand is removed from the bowl' (comp. also Trenckner, Pali Miscellany, p. 66). We do not think this explanation right, though it agrees with, or probably is based on, a note of Buddhaghosa ('pattato <i>k</i>a apanîtap&#257;<i>n</i>i<i>m</i>'). Onîta, i.e. avanita, is not apanîta, and the end of the dinner was marked, not by the Bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by his washing the bowl (see <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 4, 6), and, of course, his hands. In Sanskrit the meaning of ava-nî is, to pour (water) upon something; see the Petershurg Dictionary. We have translated, therefore, onîtapattap&#257;<i>n</i>i accordingly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Because there was no Saŋgha at that time, their declaration of taking refuge, by which they became up&#257;sakas, could refer only to the dyad (the Buddha and the Dhamma), instead of to the triad of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saŋgha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> The upadhis (substrata of existence) are specified in the commentary on the Sutta-Nip&#257;ta, ap.

The upadhis, therefore, according to this passage, consist: firstly, in the actions of mind that are directed towards the khandhas (i.e. that have the effect of propagating and augmenting the dominion of the khandhas); secondly, in the actions tending to the fivefold pleasures of sense; and thirdly, in those connected with kilesa (evil passion).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> It is difficult to believe that the P&#257;li name of Brahm&#257; Sahampati, the ruler of the Brahma worlds (see Spence Hardy's Manual, pp. 43, 56), is not connected with the Brahman svayambhû of the Brahmanical literature. Perhaps the Sanskrit equivalent of sahampati might be svayampati.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Those three Bhikkhus of the five, who had been converted, went about for alms; while the Buddha remained with their two companions, and instructed them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> This is shown exactly in the same way and with the same words that are used in § 38 with regard to the body. Body, sensations, perceptions, sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ras, and consciousness are the well-known five classes (khandha) of bodily and mental parts and powers; see Rh. D., 'Buddhism,' p. 90 seq. The self (att&#257;), which, if it exists at all, must be permanent and imperishable, is not to be found in any one of these five classes, which are all subject to origin and decay. This discourse of the Buddha's, which is frequently called the Anattalakkha<i>n</i>a Sutta (Sutta of the not having the signs of self), shows the perishable nature of the five khandhas, and that the khandhas are not the self. But it does not deal with the question, whether the self exists or not, in any other way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> A well-known scene in the life of the Bodhisatta has evidently been represented after the model of this story. See <i>G</i>&#257;taka I, p. 61; Lalita Vistara, p. 251; Bigandet, Life of Gaudama, p. 55. Nowhere in the P&#257;li Pi<i>t</i>akas is the story told about the Bodhisatta himself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> This was a position of honour among the merchants. In the later literature we hear of an office of se<i>tth</i>i (se<i>tth</i>i-<i>tth</i>&#257;na) in a city, to which any one with the requisite wealth and talent was eligible (<i>G</i>&#257;taka I, 120-122); and, according to the Mah&#257;va<i>m</i>sa, the king appointed to an office called se<i>tth</i>it&#257;, apparently at his court (Mah. p. 69). The Gahapati, or Treasurer, one of the seven jewels of a king, is explained by Buddhaghosa to be se<i>tth</i>i-gahapati (see Rh. D.'s note on Mah&#257;-sudassana Sutta I, 41). 'The Se<i>tth</i>i,' standing alone, or 'the Mah&#257;-se<i>tth</i>i,' means An&#257;tha Pi<i>nd</i>ika (<i>G</i>&#257;taka I, 95, 227-230; Dhammapada Commentary, p. 395). Below, in chapter 9, § 1, it would seem that the rank of se<i>tth</i>i was hereditary, and this is confirmed by the later literature; but this applies to the social rank only, and not to the office.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The rules about the dress of a Bhikkhu who is going to the village are given in the <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 4, 3; 5, 2. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na Sutta V, 45.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> According to Subhûti (in Childers's Dictionary) sampav&#257;reti means that the host hands dishes to the guest until the latter says, 'I have had enough.' Childers accordingly translates sampav&#257;reti, 'to cause to refuse.' But as pav&#257;reti means, 'to cause to accept,' it is impossible that sampav&#257;reti should have exactly the opposite meaning. We prefer, therefore, to take it as an emphatic synonym of pav&#257;reti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> This cannot be understood as a general rule, for it is repeated nowhere where precepts for wandering Bhikkhus are given, and, on the contrary, numerous instances occur in the Sacred Texts in which two or more Bhikkhus are mentioned as wandering together, without any expression of disapproval being added. The precept given here evidently is intended to refer only to the earliest period in the spread of the new doctrine; just as in chap. 12 a form of upasampad&#257; is introduced by Buddha which was regarded as inadmissible in later times.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> The correct spelling of this name appears to be Sen&#257;ninigama ('the General's Town'), and not Sen&#257;nigama ('the Army's Town'); the <i>G</i>&#257;taka Atthava<i>nn</i>an&#257; (vol. i. p. 68) and the Paris MS. of the Mah&#257;vagga (manu seCunda) read Sen&#257;ninigama. The Lalita Vistara has Sen&#257;patigr&#257;ma.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> The <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas (i.e. ascetics wearing matted hair) are Brahmanical v&#257;naprasthas. The description of their ascetic life given in many passages of the <i>G</i>&#257;taka Atthava<i>nn</i>an&#257; and of the Apad&#257;na exactly agrees with the picture of the forest life of the {Greek: <i>ulóbioi</i>} which so frequently occurs in the Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata. In the Mah&#257;vagga (VI, 35, 2) it is expressly stated that the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas recognised the authority of the Veda, and it is in keeping with this that the usual term for adopting the state of a <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila is 'isipabba<i>gg</i>am pabba<i>g</i>a' ti.(frequently in the <i>G</i>&#257;t. Atth.), i.e. leaving the world and becoming a <i>Ri</i>shi.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Sati<i>m</i> upa<i>tth</i>&#257;petv&#257;. Sati is here a more precise idea than memory.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> In §§ 6, 7 (excepting the last clause of § 7) the story related in §§ 1-5 is repeated in a more popular style. This appears to us to be a more archaic redaction than the preceding. We do not know any other instance in the P&#257;li Pi<i>t</i>akas of a similar repetition, excepting a short passage at the end of chap. 24. 3; and one other in the Mah&#257;-padh&#257;na Sutta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Literally, 'the Snake among men,' or 'the Elephant among men' (manussan&#257;go).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Very probably it is this story in which a similar legend has originated that the Ceylonese tell about Mahinda, the converter of their island; see Dîpava<i>m</i>sa XII, 75.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> Bigandet (Life of Gaudama, p. 135) translates this passage from the Burmese version: 'Gaudama split it in a moment, in five hundred pieces.' Doubtless the true meaning is, that there were five hundred pieces of wood, one for each of the five hundred <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas over whom was Kassapa chief. In the following two stories (§§ 13, 14) we have five hundred sacred fires.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> The ash<i>t</i>ak&#257; festivals, about which accurate details are given in the G<i>ri</i>hya Sûtras, were celebrated about the wane of the moon of the winter months m&#257;rga<i>s</i>îrsha, taisha, and m&#257;gha; see Weber, Die vedischen Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II. p. 337, and H.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> We are extremely doubtful about the meaning of kh&#257;rik&#257;<i>g</i>a, which Buddhaghosa explains by kh&#257;ribh&#257;ra. Perhaps it may mean provisions of any description of which each <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila used to keep one kh&#257;rî (a certain dry measure).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> This is evidently a remark added to the text by a reader or commentator.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> Here the same exposition which has been given relating to the eye, its objects, the sensations produced by its contact with objects, &amp;c., is repeated with reference to the ear and the other organs of sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> La<i>tth</i>ivana (Sansk. yash<i>t</i>ivana), literally, 'stick forest,' means a forest consisting of bambus. General Cunningham has the following note about this bambu forest: 'In 1862, when I was at R&#257;jgir (i.e. R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha), I heard the bambu forest always spoken of as Jaktiban; . . . I fixed the position of the bambu forest to the south-west of R&#257;jgir on the hill lying between the hot-springs of Tapoban and old R&#257;gag<i>ri</i>ha.' Reports, III, 140.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> According to General Cunningham, Gay&#257;sîsa (' the head of Gay&#257;.') is the mountain of Brahm&#257;yoni near Gay&#257;. Arch. Rep. III, 107.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The word we have rendered sacred shrine is Ketiya.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> The word householder (gahapati) is used here, as is the case not unfrequently, to denote householders of the third caste. Compare Rh. D.'s' note on Mah&#257;-sudassana Sutta, p. 260.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> Literally, 'who is known as emaciate.' This is said with reference to the mortifications practised by the <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ilas or V&#257;naprasthas. The Mah&#257;bh&#257;rata (III, 1499) uses the same adjective (k<i>ris</i>a) of a <i>G</i>a<i>t</i>ila. Vad&#257;no we take for a participle, but it is possible also to read vad&#257; no, 'tell us,' which Professor Jacobi (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Ges., XXXIV, p. 187) prefers. Buddhaghosa takes kisakovad&#257;no for a compound of kisaka and ovad&#257;na: t&#257;pas&#257;na<i>m</i> ov&#257;dako anus&#257;sako.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> The meaning is: The mantras which are recited at the sacrifices contain praises of visible things, &amp;c., and the rewards that are promised to him who offers such sacrifices do not extend beyond that same sphere.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> The P&#257;li word is upadhi, which is translated by Childers, 'substratum of being.' See our note on chap. 5. 2. In this passage upadhi is said to refer to the Khandhas (Buddhaghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> Here we have the Vedic distinction of greater and smaller sacrifices (ya<i>g</i>atayas and <i>g</i>uhotaras).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup> The words 'said the Blessed One' (ti Bhagav&#257; avo<i>k</i>a) are probably interpolated from a gloss, as they destroy the metre.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa can scarcely be right in explaining pakkhasa<i>m</i>kanta by titthiyapakkhasa<i>m</i>kanta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> Aki<i>ñk</i>ana here, and elsewhere, used as an epithet of Arahatship, refers to the state of mind in which the ki<i>ñk</i>anas, that is, lust, malice, and delusion (so in the Sa<i>m</i>gîti Sutta of the Digha Nik&#257;ya), have ceased to be. It is literally 'being without the somethings,' which are the things that stand in the way, the obstacles to Buddhist perfection; and Buddhaghosa (in the Suma<u>n</u>gala Vil&#257;sinî on the passage in the Sa<i>m</i>gîti Sutta) explains accordingly ki<i>ñk</i>ana by pa<i>l</i>ibodha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup> Gold colour is one (the 17th) of the thirty-two lakkha<i>n</i>a which form the characteristics of Buddha as a mah&#257;purisa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> Doubtless Buddhaghosa is right in explaining ko by kva.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> The ten ariyav&#257;sas. Buddhaghosa says: dasasu ariyav&#257;sesu vutthav&#257;so. The Sa<i>m</i>gîti Sutta gives the ten Noble States, as follows: 1. being free from the five bad qualities (pa<i>ñk</i>a<u>n</u>ga), 2. being possessed of the six good qualities (<i>kh</i>a<i>l</i>a<u>n</u>ga), 3. being guarded in the one thing (ek&#257;rakkha), 4. observing four things (<i>k</i>atur&#257;passena), 5. rejecting each of the four false truths (panunna pa<i>kk</i>eka-sa<i>kk</i>a), 6. seeking right things (samavayasa-dhesana), 7. having pure aims (an&#257;vila-sa<i>m</i>kappa), 8. being full of ease (passaddhak&#257;ya-sa<i>m</i>kh&#257;ra), 9. being emancipated in heart (suvimutta<i>k</i>itta), 10. being emancipated in ideas (suvimuttapa<i>ññ</i>a). The Sa<i>m</i>gîti then further enlarges on the meaning of each of these ten.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> The ten Balas, which are ten kinds of knowledge (<i>ñ</i>&#257;<i>n</i>a); see Bumouf, Lotus, p. 781 and following, and compare <i>G</i>&#257;taka I, 78.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains dasadhammavidû by dasakammapathavidû.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa explains dasabhi <i>k</i>' ûpeto by suppJying asekhehi dhammehi. The first eight of the ten asekh&#257; dhamm&#257; consist in the full perfection of samm&#257;di<i>tth</i>i (right belief) and the other categories enumerated in the formula of the Noble Eightfold Path; the ninth and tenth are the perfection of samm&#257;<i>ñ</i>&#257;<i>n</i>a (right knowledge) and samm&#257;vimutti (right emancipation).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n88" href="#fn88">88</a>]</sup> The site of the Ve<i>l</i>uvana ('bambu forest') near R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha has not yet been discovered. 'It must have occupied about the position where the ancient basements, marked K. K. K. and G. in Cunningham's map of R&#257;<i>g</i>ag<i>ri</i>ha (pl. xiv, Reports, vol. i), were found by him' (Rh. D., 'Buddhism,' p. 62 note).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n89" href="#fn89">89</a>]</sup> This seems to us the meaning of atthikehi upa<i>ññ</i>&#257;ta<i>m</i> magga<i>m</i>.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n90" href="#fn90">90</a>]</sup> The same words as are put in the mouth of Upaka, when addressing the Buddha, above, chap. 6, § 7 (and see below, § 6).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n91" href="#fn91">91</a>]</sup> This famous stanza doubtless alludes to the formula of the twelve Nid&#257;nas (see chap. 1. 2) which explains the origination and cessation of what are called here ' dhamm&#257; hetuppabhav&#257;.' Hetu and pa<i>kk</i>aya (the word so frequently used in the formula of the Nid&#257;nas) are nearly synonymous. Colebrooke (Life and Essays, vol. ii. p. 419) says that the Bauddhas distinguish between hetu, 'proximate cause,' and pa<i>kk</i>aya (pratyaya), 'concurrent occasion;' but, in practical use, this slight difference of meaning, if it really existed, has but little weight attached to it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n92" href="#fn92">92</a>]</sup> See §§ 2-4. lnstead of 'The paribb&#257;<i>g</i>aka S&#257;riputta,' of course, the pronoun of the first person is to be read; instead of' The venerable Assa<i>g</i>i , read, 'The Bhikkhu Assa<i>g</i>i;' and further, the vocative 'Friend' (&#257;vuso), addressed to Moggall&#257;na, is inserted three or four times in the course of this narration.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n93" href="#fn93">93</a>]</sup> The later Burmese and Chinese works translated by Bigandet (Life of Gaudama, p. 152) and by Beal (Romantic Legend, p. 330) add that he died. This is not in the P&#257;li text, and the Sinhalese account given by Hardy (Manual, p. 197) is directly opposed to that statement.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Upatissa was called S&#257;riputta after his mother ('The Son of S&#257;rî'); Kolita had the family name Moggall&#257;na (compare Beal, Romantic Legend, pp. 324, 331). The name Upatissa occurs in Asoka's well-known edict which has been found at Bair&#257;t. The king there quotes 'The Question of Upatissa' among the texts, the study of which he recommends to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity and to the laymen of either sex. This very probably refers to the dialogue between Assa<i>g</i>i and S&#257;riputta.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> As to this repetition of what had been related before, comp. the note on chap. 15. 6, 7. The words from gambhîre down to upadhisa<i>m</i>khaye form a <i>s</i>loka. This is one of several instances where an older passage in verse, and probably first composed in some nearly related dialect, appears in the P&#257;li Pi<i>t</i>akas in prose. It is this which explains the extraordinary grammatical construction of the first seven words. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the similar instance at Mah&#257;-parinibb&#257;na Sutta V, 62. The exclamation put into the mouth of S&#257;riputta, and afterwards of Moggall&#257;na (above, chap. 23, §§ 5, 10), ought also, perhaps, to be included in the same category.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> The chief object of the first book being to discuss the regulations for the upasampad&#257; ordination, at which the preceptor (upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya) of the candidate has a principal part, the text now goes on to relate the institution of the office and upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas, and to explain the mutual duties incumbent on upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas and pupils (saddhivih&#257;rikas).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> All this is an abbreviation of what has been given at full length in chap. 25. 4-6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> Those slight offences which were not embodied in the P&#257;timokkha are called dukka<i>t</i>a offences. They range, as to their gravity, with the p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya offences of the P&#257;timokkha. For him who had committed a dukka<i>t</i>a offence, no further penance was required than a simple confession of his fault. See <i>K</i>ullavagga , XI, 1, 10.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a>]</sup> The form for bringing a formal motion before the Order is the following: The mover first announces to the assembled Bhikkhus what resolution he is going to propose; this announcement is called <i>ñ</i>atti (see, for instance, § 4). After the <i>ñ</i>atti follows the question put to the Bhikkhus present if they approve the resolution. This question is put either once or three times; in the first case we have a <i>ñ</i>attidutiya kamma(see, for instance, II, chap. 6); in the second case, a <i>ñ</i>attikatuttha kamma (as in this chapter).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> &#257;<i>k</i>ariya as well as upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya means 'teacher,' or 'preceptor.' It is very difficult or rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction between &#257;<i>k</i>ariy&#257; and upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya. The duties of an &#257;<i>k</i>ariya towards his antev&#257;sika, and of an antev&#257;sika towards his &#257;<i>k</i>ariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 ( = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 13, 14), are exactly the same as those of an upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya towards his saddhivih&#257;rika and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 = <i>K</i>ullavagga VIII, 11, 12). The position of an upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya, however, was considered as the more important of the two; at the upasampad&#257; service the upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya had a more prominent part than the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya, as we may infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from the explanations on the 65th p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya rule which are given in the Sutta Vibha<u>n</u>ga. There it is said that, if the upasampad&#257; ordination had been conferred, against the rule, on a person that has not yet attained his twentieth year, the upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya has made himself guilty of a p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya offence, the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya and the other present Bhikkhus only of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence. We may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Up&#257;li down to Mahinda, which is given in the Dîpava<i>m</i>sa (Bh&#257;<i>n</i>av&#257;ras IV and V), is a succession of upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;yas and saddhivih&#257;rikas (see IV, 36, 42, 43, &amp;c.), not of &#257;<i>k</i>ariyas and antev&#257;sikas; the duty of instructing the young Bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances seems, therefore, to belong to the upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya rather than to the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya; compare also Dîpava<i>m</i>sa VII, 26. So among the Br&#257;hma<i>n</i>as, on the contrary, the &#257;<i>k</i>&#257;rya is estimated higher than the up&#257;dhy&#257;ya; see Manu II, 145; Y&#257;<i>gñ</i>avalkya I, 35. Compare also chap. 36. 1 (end of the paragraph), and Buddhaghosa's explanation of that passage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> Nissaya (i.e. dependence) is the relation between &#257;<i>k</i>ariya and antev&#257;sika. The antev&#257;sika lives ' niss&#257;ya ' with regard to the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya, i.e. dependent on him; the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya gives his nissaya to the antev&#257;sika. i.e. he receives him into his protection and care. At chap. 36. 1, 'nissaya ' is said also of the relation between upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya and saddhivih&#257;rika.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> That is, 'did not know how to decide whether their nissaya was destroyed, or not.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> This refers, according to Buddhaghosa, to the pa<i>n</i>&#257;man&#257; (turning away of the saddhivih&#257;rika); see chap. 27. 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: 'Coming together may be understood either by seeing or by hearing.

If he hears the voice of his upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya, who preaches the Dhamma or gladdens (lay-people by religious discourse), in the Vih&#257;ra or in the interior of a house, and if he recognises that it is his upa<i>ggh</i>&#257;ya's voice, cessation of the nissaya (towards the &#257;<i>k</i>ariya) is the consequence.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> According to Buddhaghosa, moral transgression (adhisîla) is said with regard to offences against the p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika and sa<i>m</i>gh&#257;disesa rules, while transgressions in conduct (a<i>ggh</i>&#257;<i>k</i>&#257;ra) consist in offences against the minor rules of the P&#257;timokkha. Buddhaghosa's explanation is confirmed by the Mah&#257;vagga IV, 16, 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> According to Buddhaghosa, this refers to instruction in the khandhakavatta (i.e. in the rules contained in the Khandhaka texts, Mah&#257;vagga and <i>K</i>ullavagga?). See also Spence Hardy, Manual, p. 492.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> This means instructing him in the sekhapa<i>ññ</i>atti (Buddhaghosa). We cannot say what is the accurate meaning of the last term, which apparently, as its verbal meaning seems to imply, refers to ordinances for those Bhikkhus who have entered the path of sanctification, but have not yet attained Arahatship. Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 493) gives the term sekha-sîla, which he explains as the observance of precepts in order to become a sekha. See also Hardy's note on &#257;dibrahmakariya-sila, l. l. p. 492.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> The robber A<u>n</u>gulim&#257;la (i.e. he who wears a necklace of fingers), whose original name was Ahi<i>m</i>saka, had received this surname from his habit of cutting off the fingers of his victims and wearing them as a necklace.

At Dhammapada, v. 239, kamm&#257;ra is said of a silversmith. There was probably no distinction in these early times between gold, silver, copper, and iron smiths; the same man being an artificer in all kinds of metal.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n149" href="#fn149">149</a>]</sup> This Up&#257;li is different from the famous Up&#257;li who belonged to the chief disciples of Buddha; the latter came not from R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha, but from the Sakya country.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> The law alluded to is the 65th p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya rule. Generally in the Khandhakas, which presuppose, as we have stated in our preface, the existence of the P&#257;timokkha, direct repetition of the rules laid down there has been avoided. If, nevertheless, in the Khandhakas a transgression alluded to in the P&#257;timokkha had to be mentioned again, then in most cases the Khandhakas, instead of directly indicating the penance incurred thereby, use of the guilty Bhikkhu the expression, 'yath&#257;dhammo k&#257;retabbo,' i.e. 'he is to be treated according to the law.' See H. O.'s Introduction to his edition of the Mah&#257;vagga, p. xx note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n157" href="#fn157">157</a>]</sup> Supply these pentads and hexads, respectively, from chaps. 36. 6, 7; 8, 9; 14, 15; 16, 17; 37. 1, 2; 5, 6; 7, 8; 13, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n158" href="#fn158">158</a>]</sup> Abhayûvara means, 'secure from anything.' This refers to the expression used in chap. 42, § 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n159" href="#fn159">159</a>]</sup> The Buddha's former wife. This is, as far as we know, the only passage in the P&#257;li Pi<i>t</i>akas which mentions this lady, and it deserves notice that her name is not mentioned. Probably this name was unknown to the Buddhists in early times, and thus we may best account for the difference of the simply invented names given to this lady by later writers. Compare Rh. D., Buddhism, p. 50 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n160" href="#fn160">160</a>]</sup> Granting a boon (vara) is a constant phrase used of princes when making an open promise to give to any one whatever they should ask. See, for instance, the <i>G</i>&#257;taka Story, No. 9, where the person to whom the boon was given laid it by for a convenient season; and then asked the king to make her son heir-apparent, in violation of all ancient law and custom.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n161" href="#fn161">161</a>]</sup> Nanda was a son of Mah&#257;pa<i>g</i>&#257;pati, a half-brother of the Buddha. See the story of his conversion in Rh. D.'s Buddhist Birth Stories, p. 128 (later and fuller accounts can be seen in Hardy, Manual, p. 204 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 369 seq.)</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n162" href="#fn162">162</a>]</sup> See chap. 52.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n163" href="#fn163">163</a>]</sup>Sikkh&#257;pad&#257;ni, literally, 'Paths of Training.' Compare chap. 60.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n164" href="#fn164">164</a>]</sup> Here first appear the <i>Kh</i>abbaggiya Bhikkhus (the company of the 'six Bhikkhus', with their attendants), the constant and indefatigable evil-doers throughout the whole Vinaya-Pi<i>t</i>aka. Buddhaghosa (on <i>K</i>ullayagga I, 1) says that Pa<i>nd</i>uka and Lohitaka belonged to this company, and also Assa<i>g</i>i and Punabbasu are mentioned as <i>Kh</i>abbaggiyas (see Childers s. v. <i>kh</i>abbaggiyo).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n165" href="#fn165">165</a>]</sup> The case of the novice's committing sexual intercoutse with a Bhikkhunî can have found its place here only by a negligence of the redactor, as it is comprised already in the third of the ten cases (the novice's committing impurity). Buddhaghosa (who of course never admits anything like an inadvertence of the holy Theras by whom the Vinaya is compiled) says that the third case and the tenth are distinguished here, because a person that has simply committed an impurity may receive the ordination, if he is willing to refrain himself in future; whilst a bhikkhunîdûsaka cannot be ordained in any case (see chap. 67).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n166" href="#fn166">166</a>]</sup> Tena kho pana samayena a<i>ññ</i>ataro pa<i>nd</i>ako bhikkhûsu pabba<i>g</i>ito hoti, so dahare dahare bhikkhû upasa<i>m</i>kamitv&#257; eva<i>m</i> vadeti: etha ma<i>m</i> &#257;yasmanto dûseth&#257; 'ti.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n167" href="#fn167">167</a>]</sup> I.e. not with the whole fraternity residing at that place, but with a part of it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n168" href="#fn168">168</a>]</sup> 'Whose fingers are grown together, like bats' wings' (Buddhaghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n169" href="#fn169">169</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa (Berlin MS.) explains '<i>kh</i>inniriy&#257;patha' by 'pidhasappi.' We ought to read, no doubt, pî<i>th</i>asappî, which is Sanskrit pî<i>th</i>asarpin, a cripple that is moved on in a rolling chair.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n170" href="#fn170">170</a>]</sup> See chap. 49. 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n171" href="#fn171">171</a>]</sup> Here follows the usual complete formula of a <i>ñ</i>atti<i>k</i>atuttha kamma; see chaps. 28. 4-6; 29. 3, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n172" href="#fn172">172</a>]</sup> With these sections compare the previous chapters 12, 28 and following, 36 and following. The <i>ñ</i>attis prescribed in this chapter, together with the Three Refuges Formula prescribed in chap. 12, § 4, the whole of chap. 77, and the Four Interdictions form together the current ceremony of ordination (the upasampad&#257;-kamma-v&#257;<i>k</i>&#257;) as now still in use in the Order. See the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, VII, p. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n173" href="#fn173">173</a>]</sup> I.e., according to Buddhaghosa, repeat to him all the data specified before together, in order that be might be able to give a correct answer when asked about his spiritual age.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n174" href="#fn174">174</a>]</sup> The vimokkhas (literally, deliverances) are eight stages of meditation different from the four <i>gh</i>&#257;nas. The characteristics of the different vimokkhas are specified by Childers s. v.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n175" href="#fn175">175</a>]</sup> This temporary expulsion (ukkhepaniyakamma), which is pronounced against Bhikkhus who refuse to see an offence committed by themselves (&#257;pattiy&#257; adassane), or to atone for such an offence (&#257;pattiy&#257; appatikamme), or to renounce a false doctrine (p&#257;pik&#257;ya di<i>tth</i>iy&#257; appa<i>t</i>inissagge), must be distinguished from the definitive and permanent expulsion (n&#257;san&#257;) which is pronounced against Bhikkhus who have committed a p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika offence. or in cases like those treated of in chapters 61 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n176" href="#fn176">176</a>]</sup> I.e. the sentence of expulsion is abolished; compare the Samanta P&#257;s&#257;dik&#257;, ap. Minayeff, Pr&#257;timoksha, p. 92.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n177" href="#fn177">177</a>]</sup> As in §§ 1, 2. Instead of 'Will you see that offence?' and, 'I will see it,' read here: 'Will you atone for that offence?' and, 'I will atone for it.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n178" href="#fn178">178</a>]</sup> As above. Read here: 'Will you renounce that false doctrine?' and, 'I will renounce it.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n179" href="#fn179">179</a>]</sup> Here follow some <i>S</i>lokas, probably written in Ceylon, and an elaborate Table of Contents, both of which we leave untranslated. The <i>S</i>lokas are introductory to the Table of Contents (udd&#257;na) and belong to it. A similar Table of Contents is found in the MSS. nearly after all the other Khandhakas.</p>
