					<h4 class="ctr c">Second Khandhaka</h4>

					<p class="f4 ctr">The Uposatha Ceremony, And The P&#257;timokkha</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:1">1.</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt near R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha, on the Gi<i>ggh</i>akû<i>t</i>a mountain ('the Vulture's Peak'). At that time the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas belonging to Titthiya schools assembled on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month<a id="page_239_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span> and recited their Dhamma. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were filled with favour towards, and were filled with faith in, the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas belonging to Titthiya schools; the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas belonging to Titthiya schools gained adherents.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:2">2.</a> Now when the M&#257;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'The Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas belonging to Titthiya schools assemble now on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month and recite their Dhamma. The people go to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They are filled with favour towards, and are filled with faith in, the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas who belong to Titthiya <a id="page_240"><span class="f1 g">p. 240</span></a> schools; the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas who belong to Titthiya schools gain adherents. What if the reverend ones (the Buddhist Bhikkhus) were to assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:3">3.</a> Then the M&#257;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat clown near him. Sitting near him the M&#257;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, when I was alone and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to my mind: "The Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas, &amp;c.; what if the reverend ones were to assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month." Well, Lord, let the reverend ones assemble also on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each half month.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1:4">4.</a> Then the Blessed One taught, incited, animated, and gladdened the M&#257;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra by religious discourse; and the M&#257;gadha king Seniya Bimbis&#257;ra, having been taught and gladdened by the Blessed One by religious discourse, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, passed round him with his right side towards him, and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you assemble on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth clay of each month.'</p>

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<hr class="hrctr" />

					<p>&nbsp;</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p2">2.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4">At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that the Blessed One had ordered them to assemble on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month, assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month and sat there silent. The people went to them in order to hear the Dhamma. They were annoyed, murmured, and became angry: 'How can the Sakyaputtiya Sama<i>n</i>as, when they have assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month, sit there silent, like the dumb, or like hogs? Ought they not to recite the Dhamma, when they have assembled?' Some Bhikkhus heard those people that were annoyed, murmured, and had become angry; these Bhikkhus told this thing to the Blessed One. In consequence of that and on this occasion the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'I prescribe, O Bhikkhus, that you recite the Dhamma, when you have assembled on the fourteenth &amp;c. day of each half month.'</p>

					<h4 class="ctr c"><a id="p3">3.</a></h4>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:1">1.</a> Now when the Blessed One was alone and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'What if I were to prescribe that the Bhikkhus recite as the P&#257;timokkha<a id="page_241_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span> the precepts which I have promulgated to <a id="page_242"><span class="f1 g">p. 242</span></a> them; this will be their Uposatha service (service of the fast-day).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:2">2.</a> And the Blessed One, having left the solitude in the evening, in consequence of that and on this occasion, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the Bhikkhus: 'When I was alone, O Bhikkhus, and had retired into solitude, the following consideration, &amp;c., this will be their Uposatha service. I prescribe you, O Bhikkhus, to recite the P&#257;timokkha.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p3:3">3.</a> 'And you ought, O Bhikkhus, to recite it in this way: Let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the foilowing <i>ñ</i>atti before the Saŋgha: "Let the Saŋgha, reverend Sirs, hear me. To-day it is Uposatha, the fifteenth (of the half month). If the Saŋgha is ready, let the Saŋgha hold the Uposatha service and recite the P&#257;timokkha. What ought to be first done by the Saŋgha? Proclaim the p&#257;risuddhi<a id="page_242_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, Sirs. I will recite the P&#257;timokkha."</p>

					<p class="f4">'"He who has committed an offence, may confess it; if there is no offence, you should remain silent; from your being silent I shall understand that the reverend brethen are pure (from offences). As a single person that has been asked a question, answers it, the same is the matter if before an <a id="page_243"><span class="f1 g">p. 243</span></a> assembly like this a question has been solemnly proclaimed three times: if a Bhikkhu, after a threefold proclamation, does not confess an existing offence which he remembers, he commits an intentional falsehood. Now, reverend brethren, an intentional falsehood has been declared an impediment<a id="page_243_fr_1"></a><span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span> by the Blessed One. Therefore, by a Bhikkhu who has committed (an offence), and remembers it, and desires to become pure, an existing offence should be confessed; for if it has been confessed, it is treated duly."'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:1">1.</a> At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that the P&#257;timokkha recitation had been instituted by the Blessed One, recited the P&#257;timokkha every day.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p4:2">2.</a> At that time the Bhikkhus, considering that it had been prescribed by the Blessed One to recite the P&#257;timokkha on the Uposatha day, recited the P&#257;timokkha three times each half month, on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of each half month.</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

					<p class="f4">'The P&#257;timokkha, O Bhikkhus, is not to be recited three times each half month. He who recites it (tnree times), commits a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:2">2.</a> Now the Bhikkhus thought: 'The Blessed One has prescribed that the Uposatha service is to be held by the complete fraternity. How far does completeness extend, as far as one residence (or one district), or all over the earth?'</p>

					<p class="f4">They told this thing to the Blessed One.</p>

Now (one day) when the reverend Mah&#257; Kappina was alone and had retired into solitude, the following consideration presented itself to his mind: 'Shall I go to the Uposatha service or shall I not go? Shall I go to the functions of the Order <a id="page_248"><span class="f1 g">p. 248</span></a> or shall I not go? Indeed I have become pure by the highest purity (i.e. I have reached Arahatship or Nirv&#257;<i>n</i>a).'</p>

The Blessed One sat down on a seat laid out for him, and the reverend Mah&#257; Kappina, after having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, sat down also near him.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p5:5">5.</a> When the reverend Mah&#257; Kappina was seated near him, the Blessed One said to him: 'When you were alone, Kappina, and had retired into solitude, has not the following consideration presented itself to your mind: "Shall I go (&amp;c., as in § 3 down to:) by the highest purity?"'</p>

The landmarks having been proclaimed, let a learned, competent Bhikkhu proclaim the following <i>ñ</i>atti before the Saŋgha: "Let the Saŋgha, reverend Sirs, hear me. If the Saŋgha is ready, let the Saŋgha, as the landmarks have been proclaimed all around, by these land marks determine the boundary for common residence and communion of Uposatha.

The Bhikkhus who came to the Uposatha, arrived when the P&#257;timokkha was being recited, or when it had just been recited, or they were obliged to stay the night on the way.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n1" href="#fn1">1</a>]</sup> One should be inclined to understand that the Paribb&#257;<i>g</i>akas assembled twice each half month, on the eighth day of the pakkha and on the fourteenth or fifteenth day, according to the different length of the pakkha. However, chap. 4 makes it probable that not two days in each pakkha are to be understood, but three. Compare, however, the remark of Buddhaghosa, quoted in the note on chap. 34. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n2" href="#fn2">2</a>]</sup> On the origin and the meaning of the title 'P&#257;timokkha,' see our Introduction, p. xxvii.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n3" href="#fn3">3</a>]</sup> See chap. 22. If a Bhikkhu is prevented by distase from assisting to the P&#257;timokkha ceremony, he is to charge another Bhikkhu with his p&#257;risuddhi, i.e. with the solemn declaration that he is pure from the offences specified in the P&#257;timokkha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n4" href="#fn4">4</a>]</sup> These words are evidently the answer of the Bhikkhus then present to the proclamation of the p&#257;timokkhuddesaka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n5" href="#fn5">5</a>]</sup> See § 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n6" href="#fn6">6</a>]</sup> §§ 4-8 contain an explanation, word by word, of the formula given in § 3. This explanation is a portion of the ancient commentarf on the P&#257;timokkha which at the time of the redaction of the Vinaya Pi<i>t</i>aka has been admitted into it in its full extent (see the Introduction, p. xv seq.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n7" href="#fn7">7</a>]</sup> See p. 241, note 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> See p. 1, note 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> The five classes of offences are, the p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika, sa<i>m</i>gh&#257;disesa, p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya, p&#257;<i>t</i>idesaniya, dukka<i>t</i>a offences; the seven classes, the p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika, sa<i>m</i>gh&#257;disesa, thulla<i>kk</i>aya, p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya, p&#257;<i>t</i>idesaniya, dukka<i>t</i>a, dubbh&#257;sita off en ces. See, for instance, <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 3, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n10" href="#fn10">10</a>]</sup> The P&#257;li text has ' dukka<i>t</i>a.' We cannot interpret here dukka<i>t</i>a in the technical sense of a dukka<i>t</i>a offence (see the Introduction, p. xxiv, for intentional falsehood belongs to the class of the p&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya offences, among which it occupies the first place.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 78, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n12" href="#fn12">12</a>]</sup> See chap. 5. 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n13" href="#fn13">13</a>]</sup> See the note on I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> I.e. to abolish the (character of uposath&#257;g&#257;ra, conferred on the Vih&#257;ra &amp;c. by the act of sammuti.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n15" href="#fn15">15</a>]</sup> Uposatha-pamukha (literally, that which has the Uposatha at its head, or, that which is situated in front of the Uposatha) evidently means the place around the uposath&#257;g&#257;ra, in which the P&#257;timokkha recitation may be heard as well as in the uposath&#257;g&#257;ra itself.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup>'Mana<i>m</i> vu<i>lh</i>o ahosi.' Buddhaghosa: 'îsaka<i>m</i> appattavu<i>lh</i>abh&#257;vo ahosi.' Mana<i>m</i> is evidently the equivalent of Sanskrit man&#257;k.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa's note on this passage contains some details regarding the way which Mah&#257; Kassapa went. Andhakavinda is three g&#257;vuta distant from R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha. There were eighteen (? the MS. reads: a<i>tth</i>&#257;ra mah&#257;vih&#257;r&#257;) great Vih&#257;ras around R&#257;<i>g</i>agaha included by the same boundary which Buddha himself had consecrated. The Uposatha service for this whole district was performed in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana monastery. The river which Mah&#257; Kassapa crossed on his way to the Ve<i>l</i>uvana was the Sappinî, which rises in the Gi<i>ggh</i>akû<i>t</i>a mountain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n18" href="#fn18">18</a>]</sup> Ti<i>k</i>îvarena avippav&#257;sa means not parting with the three robes which belong to the usual 'parikkh&#257;r&#257; ' (requisites) of a Bhikkhu. Bhikkhus were not allowed to part with their <i>k</i>îvaras, excepting under special circumstances and for a limited time (see the P&#257;timokkha, 29th nissaggiya dhamma). Conferring the character of ti<i>k</i>îvarena avippav&#257;sa on a boundary means, we believe, to determine that it should be free to Bhikkhus residing within this boundary, to keep a set of robes wherever they liked within the same boundary (excepting in a village, § 3), and that such an act should not be considered as parting with the robes.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa observes that this rule applies to Bhikkhus only, and not to Bhikkhunîs. For Bhikkhunîs reside only in villages; there would be no <i>k</i>îvaraparih&#257;ra at all for Bhikkhunîs, if they were to use the kammav&#257;<i>k</i>&#257; given in § 4. Buddhaghosa also observes at this occasion that the boundaries of the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha and of the Bhikkhunîsa<i>m</i>gha are quite independent from each other, and that the rules given in chap. 13 do not refer to boundaries the one of which belongs to the Bhikkhusa<i>m</i>gha, the other to the Bhikkhunîsa<i>m</i>gha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> As to the extent attributed to the 'g&#257;mûpa<i>k</i>&#257;ra' (neighbourhood of the village), see the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, quoted by Minayeff, Pr&#257;tim. p. 66, l. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> This formula is identical with that given in § 2. The only difference is that after the words 'the character of ti<i>k</i>îvarena a vippav&#257;sa,' the words 'excepting villages and the neighbourhood of villages' are inserted.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> 1 abbhantara = 28 hattha (Buddhaghosa and Abhidh&#257;nappadîpik&#257;, v. 197). See Rh. D., 'Coins and Measures,' &amp;c., p. 15.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa prescribes to leave an interstice of one hattha, and he adds that the ancient Sinhalese commentaries differ as to the measure required for this interstice: the Kurundi requires one vidatthi, the Mah&#257;pa<i>kk</i>ari four a<u>n</u>gula.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> For a definition of lawfulness and unlawfulness of the official functions of the Order as well as of completeness and incompleteness of the congregation by which such acts are performed, see IX, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n31" href="#fn31">31</a>]</sup> Here follows an exact repetition or the story told in § 3, which is given here, of course, in the present tense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n32" href="#fn32">32</a>]</sup> This appears to be the meaning of ga<i>n</i>amaggena ga<i>n</i>etu<i>m</i>; Buddhaghosa has no note on this passage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n33" href="#fn33">33</a>]</sup> Enumerations of terms indicating the different cases that come under a Vinaya rule or a dogmatical proposition are called m&#257;tik&#257;; for instance, in discussing the first p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika rule the Vibha<u>n</u>ga gives the following m&#257;tik&#257;pad&#257;ni: tisso itthiyo manussitthi amanussitthi tira<i>kkh</i>&#257;nagatitthi, tayo ubhatovya<i>ñg</i>anak&#257; manussubhatovya<i>ñg</i>anako amanussubh. tira<i>kkh</i>&#257;nagatubh., &amp;c. Most of the works belonging to the Abhidhamma Pi<i>t</i>aka are based on and opened by such m&#257;tik&#257; lists.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n34" href="#fn34">34</a>]</sup> Or 'scrupulous,' in good sense.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n35" href="#fn35">35</a>]</sup> See I, 25, 12, with our note.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n36" href="#fn36">36</a>]</sup> See III, 1 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n37" href="#fn37">37</a>]</sup> See § 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n38" href="#fn38">38</a>]</sup> P&#257;risuddhi, literally, means purity. He declares that he is pure from the offences specified in the P&#257;timokkha, and charges another Bhikkhu with proclaiming his declaration before the assembled chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n39" href="#fn39">39</a>]</sup> Literally, on the spot, i.e. without setting out on his way to the assembly.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n40" href="#fn40">40</a>]</sup> We have no doubt that this is the correct translation or vibbhamati (see I, 39, 5). The difference between vibbhamati (he returns to the world) and sikkha<i>m</i> pa<i>kk</i>akkh&#257;ti (he abandons the precepts) seems to be that the former is an informal, and the latter a formal, renunciation or the Order.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n41" href="#fn41">41</a>]</sup> The precepts are abandoned (sikkh&#257; pa<i>kk</i>akkhit&#257; hoti) by declaring that one abandons the Buddha, or the Dhamma, or the Saŋgha, or the Vinaya, &amp;c. By such a declaration a Bhikkhu who wishes to return to a layman's life, or to go over to a Titthiya sect, gives up his character as a member of the Buddhist fraternity, The rules about the sikkh&#257;pa<i>kk</i>akkh&#257;na are given in the Vibha<u>n</u>ga, in the explanation of the first p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika rule (chap. 8, § 2).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n42" href="#fn42">42</a>]</sup> Most probably antimavatthu refers to the p&#257;r&#257;<i>g</i>ika offences which require excommunication.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> See the story given in I, 63.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> The rules given here regarding the <i>kh</i>anda (declaration of consent of an absentee) that is required for the performance of official acts are word for word the same as those set out in chap. 22. 1-4, regarding the p&#257;risuddhi required at the Uposatha service.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> See §§ 1, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The quorum for several official acts of the Order was five or more Bhikkhus; see IX, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Uposatha by mutual declaration of purity from the offences specified in the P&#257;timokkha; see § 3 seq.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> The same phrase is repeated twice more.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> See §§ 3, 4. The <i>ñ</i>atti prescribed in the preceding case does not apply to this case.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> See chap. 22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga IX, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> The decision given for the case of a smaller number of Bhikkus arriving late, is here, and invariably throughout the following exposition, identical with the decision of the case of the number of Bhikkhus being equal on the two sides.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> The same three cases are distinguished here as in §§ 2, 3, according as the number of Bhikkhus who are late, is greater, the same, or smaller than that of the other Bhikkhus. The first case is decided by Buddha as above; in the decision of the second and third cases, instead of let those (who have arrived late) hear the rest, read: 'let those (who have arrived late) proclaim their p&#257;risuddhi in the presence (of the other brethren).'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup>  The three triads of §§ 5, 6, 7 agree exactly with the triad of § 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Here follow fifteen cases which are arranged exactly as in chap. 28. Instead of 'they who have recited it, are free from guilt,' read: 'they who have recited it, have committed a dukka<i>t</i>a offence.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> The decision of these fifteen cases is the same as in chap. 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> I.e. they destroy their own welfare by their wickedness.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> The decisions as in chap. 29; only read instead of 'd ukka/a offence,' 'thulla<i>kk</i>aya offence' (grave sin).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> Five times fifteen cases, in chaps. 28-32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> Remarks like this, which indicate the rules for supplying abbreviated passages, do not belong, strictly speaking, to the text of the Vinaya itself, but form a posterior addition, as is shown also by grammatical peculiarities. In chaps. 28-32 we have seventy-five cases, or twenty-five triads; all of these triads contain the words: 'They know that there are other resident Bhikkhus absent.' By successively varying these words six times, as is indicated in chap. 33, we obtain a hundred and seventy-five triads.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> I.e. the assembled Bhikkhus as well as the incoming reside in the same &#257;v&#257;sa.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> 'Peyy&#257;la' is identical in meaning and, we believe, etymologically with 'pariy&#257;ya.' See Childers s.v.; H. O.'s remarks in; Kuhn's Zeitschrift fur vergleichende Sprachforschung, vol. xxv, 324; Trenckner, Pali Miscellany, p. 66.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: 'They who count the day as the fifteenth, arrive from a distant kingdom, or they have held the preceding Uposatha on the fourteenth.' It seems to follow from this remark of Buddhaghosa that after an Uposatha on the fourteenth invariably an Uposatha on the fifteenth must follow, i.e. the Uposatha may not be held on the fourteenth ad libitum, but only in the second pakkha of the short months. Compare chap. 4 and the note on chap. 1. 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> See chap. 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> I.e. with a number of Bhikkhus sufficient for holding Uposatha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Probably this means a place the quality of which, whether residence or non-residence, is doubtful.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Nine cases are distinguished here quite as in §§ 1-3.</p>

X, 1, 4) we are told that Buddha, when admitting women to the Order of mendicants, prescribed for them a probationary course of instruction, which should last two years, after which time they were to ask for the upasampad&#257; ordination. During these two years the candidates were called sikkham&#257;<i>n</i>&#257;s. Childers (Dict. s.v. sikkhati) has misunderstood the Mah&#257;va<i>m</i>sa (p. 37), when he states that in the case of Asoka's daughter Saŋghamitt&#257; the training prescribed for the sikkham&#257;<i>n</i>&#257;s was absolved in a single day.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> See the note on chap. 22. 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> The law alluded to most probably is the 69th P&#257;<i>k</i>ittiya rule, which expressly treats only of the conduct towards Bhikkhus refusing to renounce false doctrines, but it may be extended by analogy also to the two other categories of Bhikkhus mentioned in our passage.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> See chap. 22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> I.e. a Bhikkhu subject to the penal discipline of pariv&#257;sa, the rules of which are discussed at length in the second and third books of the <i>K</i>ullavagga.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> If a schism among the fraternity has been composed, the reconciled parties hold Uposatha together (X, 5, 14).</p>
