					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.1">1.1</a> At that time the blessed Buddha dwelt at Rā<i>g</i>agaha, in the Ve<i>l</i>uvana, in the Kalandaka-nivāpa. At that time Vesāl&icirc; was an opulent, prosperous town, populous, crowded with people, abundant with food<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn1" href="#n1">1</a>]</sup></span>; there were seven thousand seven hundred and seven storeyed buildings, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven pinnacled buildings, and seven thousand seven hundred and seven pleasure grounds (&Acirc;rāmas), and seven thousand seven hundred and seven lotus-ponds. There was also the courtezan Ambapālikā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn2" href="#n2">2</a>]</sup></span>, who was beautiful, graceful, pleasant, gifted with the highest beauty of complexion, well versed in dancing, singing, and lute-playing, much visited by desirous people. She asked fifty (kahāpa<i>n</i>as) for one night. Through that person Vesāl&icirc; became more and more flourishing.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.2">1.2</a> Now a merchant from Rā<i>g</i>agaha went to Vesāl&icirc; on a certain business. That Rā<i>g</i>agaha merchant saw what an opulent, prosperous town Vesāl&icirc; was, how populous, crowded with people, and abundant with food, and the seven thousand seven <a id="pg172"><span class="f2 g"><b>[172]</b></span></a> hundred and seven storeyed buildings . . . . and the courtezan Ambapāl&icirc;, who was beautiful . . . . and through whom Vesāl&icirc; became more and more flourishing. And the Rā<i>g</i>agaha merchant, after having done his business in Vesāl&icirc;, returned to Rā<i>g</i>agaha and went to the place where the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra was. Having approached him, he said to the Māgadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra: 'Vesāl&icirc;, Your Majesty, is an opulent, prosperous town (&amp;c., as in §1, down to:) Through that person Vesāl&icirc; becomes more and more flourishing. May it please Your Majesty, let us also install a courtezan.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(The king replied), 'Well, my good Sir, look for such a girl whom you can install as courtezan.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.3">1.3</a> Now at that time there was at Rā<i>g</i>agaha a girl Sālavat&icirc; by name, who was beautiful, graceful, pleasant, and gifted with the highest beauty of complexion. That girl Sālavat&icirc; the Rā<i>g</i>agaha merchant installed as courtezan. And before long the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; was well versed in dancing, singing, and lute-playing, and much visited by desirous people, and she asked one hundred (kahāpa<i>n</i>as) for one night. And before long the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; became pregnant. Now the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; thought: 'Men do not like a pregnant woman. If anybody should find out regarding me that "The courtezan Sālavat&icirc; is pregnant," my whole position will be lost. What if I were to have the people told that I am sick.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; gave orders to the door-keeper (saying), 'Let no man enter here, my good door-keeper, and if a man calls for me, tell him that I am sick.' The door-keeper accepted <a id="pg173"><span class="f2 g"><b>[173]</b></span></a> this of the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; (by saying), Yes, Madam.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.4">1.4</a> And the courtezan Sālavat&icirc;, when the child in her womb had reached maturity, gave birth to a boy. And the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; gave orders to her maid-servant (saying), 'Go, my girl, put this boy into an old winnowing basket, take him away, and throw him away on a dust-heap.' The servant accepted this order of the courtezan Sālavat&icirc; (by saying), 'Yes, Madam,' put that boy into an old winnowing basket, took him away, and threw him away on a dust-heap.</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time a royal prince, Abhaya by name<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn3" href="#n3">3</a>]</sup></span>, went betimes to attend upon the king, and saw that boy, around whom crows were gathering. When he saw that, he asked the people: 'What is that, my good Sirs, around which the crows are gathering?'</p>

					<p class="f4">It is a boy, Your Highness <span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn4" href="#n4">4</a>]</sup></span>.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Is he alive, Sirs?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is alive, Your Highness.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my good Sirs, bring that boy to our palace and give him to the nurses to nourish him.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And those people accepted that order of the royal prince Abhaya (by saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' brought that boy to the palace of the royal prince Abhaya, and gave him to the nurses (saying),</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nourish (this boy).'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg174"><span class="f2 g"><b>[174]</b></span></a> Because (the people had said about this boy to Abhaya), 'He is alive' (<i>g</i>&icirc;vati), they gave him the name of <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka; because he had been caused to be nourished by the royal prince (kumārena posāpito), they gave him the name of Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn5" href="#n5">5</a>]</sup></span>.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.5">1.5</a> And ere long <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a came to the years of discretion. And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where the royal prince Abhaya was; having approached him he said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'Who is my mother, Your Highness, and who is my father?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I do not know your mother, my good <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, but I am your father, for I have had you nourished.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'In these royal families it is not easy to find one's livelihood without knowing an art. What if I were to learn an art.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.6">1.6</a> At that time there lived at Takkasilā (&#0932;&#0940;&#0958;&#0953;&#0955;&#0945;) a world-renowned physician. And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a without asking leave of the royal prince Abhaya set out for Takkasilā. Wandering from place to place he came to Takkasilā and to the place where <a id="pg175"><span class="f2 g"><b>[175]</b></span></a> that physician was. Having approached him he said to that physician, 'I wish to learn your art, doctor.</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, friend <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, learn it.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a learnt much, and learnt easily, and understood well, and did not forget what he had learnt. And when seven years had elapsed, <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'I learn much, and learn easily, and I understand well, and I do not forget what I have learnt. I have studied now seven years, and I do not see the end of this art. When shall I see the end of this art?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.7">1.7</a> And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where that physician was; having approached him he said to that physician: 'I learn much, doctor, and I learn easily; I understand well, and do not forget what I have learnt. I have studied now seven years, and I do not see the end of this art. When shall I see the end of this art?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Very well, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, take this spade, and seek round about Takkasilā a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, and whatever (plant) you see which is not medicinal, bring it to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of that physician (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' took a spade, and went around about Takkasilā a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, but he did not see anything that was not medicinal. Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where that physician was; having approached him he said to that physician: 'I have been seeking, doctor, all around Takkasilā a yo<i>g</i>ana on every side, but I have not seen anything that is not medicinal.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(The physician replied), 'You have done your learning, my good <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka; this will do for acquiring your livelihood.' Speaking thus he gave to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka <a id="pg176"><span class="f2 g"><b>[176]</b></span></a> Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a a little (money) for his journey (home).</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.8">1.8</a> And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took that little money, given to him for his journey, and set out for Rā<i>g</i>agaha. And on the way at Sāketa that little money of <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was spent. Now <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'These ways are wild, and there is but little water and little food; it is difficult to travel here without money for the journey. What if I were to try to get some money for my journey.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn6" href="#n6">6</a>]</sup></span> wife at Sāketa had been suffering for seven years from disease in the head; many very great and world-renowned physicians came, but they could not restore her to health; they received much gold, and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4">And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, when he had entered Sāketa, asked the people: 'Who is sick here, my good Sirs? Whom shall I cure?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'That se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, doctor, has been suffering for seven years from a disease in the head; go, doctor, and cure that se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.9">1.9</a> Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the house of that householder, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i; and when he had reached it, he gave orders to the door-keeper (saying), 'Go, my good door-keeper, and tell the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: "A physician has come in, Madam, who wants to see you."'</p>

					<p class="f4">That door-keeper accepted this order of <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was, and having approached her, he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'A physician has come in, Madam, who wants to see you.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg177"><span class="f2 g"><b>[177]</b></span></a> 'What sort of man is that physician, my good door-keeper?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'He is a young man, Madam.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, my good door-keeper, what can a young physician help me? Many very great and world-renowned physicians have come and have not been able to restore me to health; they have received much gold, and have gone away.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.10">1.10</a> Thus that door-keeper went to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a; having approached him he said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife has said, doctor: "Nay, my good door-keeper (&amp;c., as in §9)."'</p>

					<p class="f4">(<i>G</i>&icirc;vaka replied), 'Go, my good door-keeper, and tell the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: "The physician, Madam, says: 'Do not give me anything beforehand, Madam when you shall have been restored to health, then you may give me what you like."'</p>

					<p class="f4">The door-keeper accepted this order of <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Yes, doctor,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was, and having approached her he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'The physician, Madam, says (&amp;c., as above).'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my good door-keeper, let the physician enter.'</p>

					<p class="f4">The door-keeper accepted this order of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife (saying), 'Yes, Madam,' went to the place where <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was, and having approached him he said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife calls you, doctor.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.11">1.11</a> Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife was; having approached her, and having carefully observed the change in the appearance of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, he said to the <a id="pg178"><span class="f2 g"><b>[178]</b></span></a> se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife: 'We want one pasata<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn7" href="#n7">7</a>]</sup></span> of ghee, Madam.' Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife ordered one pasata of ghee to be given to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a. And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a boiled up that pasata of ghee with various drugs, ordered the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife to lie down on her back in the bed, and gave it her through her nose. And the butter given through the nose came out through the mouth. And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife spat it out into the spittoon, and told the maid-servant: 'Come, my girl, take this ghee up with a piece of cotton.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.12">1.12</a> Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'It is astonishing how niggardly this house-wife is, in that she has this ghee, which ought to be thrown away, taken up with a piece of cotton. I have given her many highly precious drugs. What sort of fee will she give me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, when she observed the change of demeanour in <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'Why are you perplexed, doctor?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I thought: "It is astonishing, &amp;c."'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Householders like us, doctor, know why to economize thus; this ghee will do for the servants or workmen to anoint their feet with, or, it can be poured into the lamp. Be not perplexed, doctor, you will not lose your fee.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg179"><span class="f2 g"><b>[179]</b></span></a> <a id="p1.13">1.13</a> And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a drove away the disease in the head which the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife had had for seven years, by once giving her medicine through the nose. Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's wife, who had been' restored to health, gave four thousand (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as) to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a; her son (thinking), 'My mother stands there restored,' gave him four thousand; her daughter-in-law (thinking), 'My mother-in-law stands there restored,' gave him four thousand; the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, (thinking), 'My wife stands there restored,' gave him four thousand and a man-servant and a maid-servant and a coach with horses.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a took those sixteen thousand (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as) and the man-servant, the maid-servant, and the coach with the horses, and set out for Rā<i>g</i>agaha. In due course he came to Rā<i>g</i>agaha, and to the place where the royal prince Abhaya was; having approached him he said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'This, Your Highness, (have I received for) the first work I have done, sixteen thousand and a man-servant and a maid-servant and a coach with horses; may Your Highness accept this as payment for my bringing up.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, keep it, but do not get a dwelling for yourself elsewhere than in our residence.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the royal prince Abhaya (saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' and got himself a dwelling in the residence of the royal prince Abhaya.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.14">1.14</a> At that time the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra suffered from a fistula; his garments were stained with blood. When the queens saw that, <a id="pg180"><span class="f2 g"><b>[180]</b></span></a> they ridiculed (the king, and said): 'His Majesty is having his courses. His Majesty will bring forth!' The king was annoyed at that. And the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra said to the royal prince Abhaya: 'I am suffering, my dear Abhaya, from such a disease that my garments are stained with blood; and the queens, when they see it, ridicule (me by saying), "His Majesty is, &amp;c." Pray, my dear Abhaya, find a physician for me, able to cure me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'This excellent young physician of ours, Sire, <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, he will cure Your Majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Then pray, my dear Abhaya, give orders to the physician <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, and he shall cure me.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.15">1.15</a> Then the royal prince Abhaya gave orders to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, and cure the king.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the royal prince Abhaya (by saying), 'Yes, Your Highness,' took some medicament in his nail, and went to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra was. Having approached him, he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra: 'Let us see your disease, Your Majesty.' And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a healed the fistula of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra by one anointing.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra, having been restored to health, ordered his five hundred wives to put on all their ornaments; then he ordered them to take their ornaments off and to make a heap of them, and he said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'All these ornaments, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, of my five hundred wives shall be thine.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, Sire, may Your Majesty remember my office.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="pg181"><span class="f2 g"><b>[181]</b></span></a> 'Very well, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, you can wait upon me and my seraglio and the fraternity of Bhikkhus with the Buddha at its head.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.16">1.16</a> At that time the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i at Rā<i>g</i>agaha had been suffering for seven years from a disease in the head. Many very great and world-renowned physicians came, and were not able to restore him to health; they received much gold and went away. And a prognostication had been made by the physicians to him, to wit: Some of the physicians said: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die on the fifth day;' other physicians said: 'The se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die on the seventh day.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Now (a certain) Rā<i>g</i>agaha merchant thought: 'This se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, this householder, does good service both to the king and to the merchants' guild. Now the physicians have made prognostication to him(&amp;c., as above). There is <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, the royal physician, an excellent young doctor. What if we were to ask the king for his physician <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka to cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.17">1.17</a> And the Rā<i>g</i>agaha merchant went to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra was; having approached him, he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra: That se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, Sire, that householder, does good service both to Your Majesty and to the merchants' guild. Now the physicians have made prognostication to him, &amp;c. May it please Your Majesty to order the physician <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka to cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra gave <a id="pg182"><span class="f2 g"><b>[182]</b></span></a> orders to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, and cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty,' went to the place where the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, was, and having approached him, and having carefully observed the change in his appearance, he said to the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder: 'If I restore you to health, my good householder, what fee will you give me?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'All that I possess shall be yours, doctor, and I will be your slave.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.18">1.18</a> 'Well, my good householder, will you be able to lie down on one side for seven months?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And will you be able, my good householder, to lie down on the other side for seven months?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'And will you be able, my good householder, to lie down on your back for seven months?'</p>

					<p class="f4">'I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on my back for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a ordered the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, to lie down on his bed, tied him fast to his bed, cut through the skin of the head, drew apart the flesh on each side of the incision, pulled two worms out (of the wound), and showed them to the people (saying), 'See, Sirs, these two worms, a small one and a big one. The doctors who said, "On the fifth day the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die," have seen this big worm, and how it would penetrate on the fifth day to the brain of <a id="pg183"><span class="f2 g"><b>[183]</b></span></a> the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, and that when it had penetrated to the brain, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, would die. Those doctors have seen it quite rightly. And the doctors who said, "On the seventh day the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, will die," have seen this small worm, and how it would penetrate on the seventh day to the brain of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, and that when it had penetrated to the brain, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, would die. Those doctors have seen it quite rightly.' (Speaking thus) he closed up the sides of the wound, stitched up the skin on the head, and anointed it with salve.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.19">1.19</a> And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am not able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Did you not tell me, my good householder: "I shall be able, doctor, to lie down on one side for seven months?"'</p>

					<p class="f4">'It is true, doctor, I told you so indeed, but I shall die (if I do); I cannot lie down on one side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my good householder, then you must lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am not able, doctor, to lie down on the other side for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Did you not tell me, &amp;c.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Well, my good householder, then you must lie down on your back for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">And when seven days had elapsed, the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'I am <a id="pg184"><span class="f2 g"><b>[184]</b></span></a> not able, doctor, to lie down on my back for seven months.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Did you not tell me, &amp;c.?'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.20">1.20</a> 'If I had not spoken thus to you, my good householder, you would not have lain down even so long a time.

					<p class="f4">'All that I possess shall be yours, doctor, and I will be your slave.'</p>

					<p class="f4">'Nay, my good householder, do not give me all that you possess, and do not be my slave; give one hundred thousand (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as) to the king, and one hundred thousand to me.'</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i, the householder, having regained his health, gave a hundred thousand (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as) to the king, and a hundred thousand to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.21">1.21</a> At that time the son of the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i at Benares, who used to amuse himself by tumbling (mokkha<i>k</i>ikā<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn8" href="#n8">8</a>]</sup></span>), brought upon himself an entanglement of his <a id="pg185"><span class="f2 g"><b>[185]</b></span></a> intestines, in consequence of which he could digest neither the rice-milk which he drank, nor the food of which he partook, nor was he able to ease himself in the regular way. In consequence of that he grew lean, he looked disfigured and discoloured, (his complexion became) more and more yellow, and the veins stood out upon his skin.</p>

					<p class="f4">Now the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares thought: 'My son is suffering from such and such a disease: he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks (&amp;c., as above, down to:) and the veins stand out upon his skin.

					<p class="f4">And the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares went to Rā<i>g</i>agaha and repaired to the place where the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra was; having approached him he said to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra: 'My son, Your Majesty, is suffering from such and such a disease: he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks (&amp;c., as above, down to:) and the veins stand out upon his skin.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.22">1.22</a> Then the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra gave orders to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (saying), 'Go, my dear <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka; go to Benares, and cure the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's son at Benares.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a accepted this order of the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra (by saying), 'Yes, Your Majesty,' went to Benares, and repaired to the place where the son of the Benares se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i was; having approached him, and having carefully <a id="pg186"><span class="f2 g"><b>[186]</b></span></a> observed the change in his appearance, he ordered the people to leave the room, drew the curtain, tied him fast to a pillar, placed his wife in front of him, cut through the skin of the belly, drew the twisted intestines out, and showed them to his wife (saying), 'Look here what the disease was, from which your husband was suffering. This is the reason why he neither can digest the rice-milk which he drinks, nor can digest the food of which he partakes, nor is able to ease himself in the regular way, and why he has grown lean, and looks disfigured and discoloured, and (why his complexion has become) more and more yellow, and the veins have stood out upon his skin.' (Speaking thus), he disentangled the twisted intestines, put the intestines back (into their right position), stitched the skin together, and anointed it with salve. And before long the Benares se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i's son regained his health.</p>

					<p class="f4">Then the se<i>t</i><i>th</i>i of Benares (saying to himself), 'My son stands here restored to health,' gave sixteen thousand (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as) to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.23">1.23</a> At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota (of U<i>g</i><i>g</i>en&icirc;) was suffering from jaundice.

Then king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota sent a messenger to the Magadha king Se<i>n</i>iya Bimbisāra (with the following message): 'I am suffering from such and such a disease; pray, Your Majesty<span class="f3"><sup>[<a id="fn9" href="#n9">9</a>]</sup></span>, give <a id="pg187"><span class="f2 g"><b>[187]</b></span></a> orders to the physician <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka; he will cure me.'

					<p class="f4">Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'The disease of this king is such a one that it cannot be cured without ghee.

					<p class="f4">Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a boiled some ghee with various drugs so as to give it the colour, the smell, and the taste of an astringent decoction.

					<p class="f4">And king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota sent the following order to the (royal) stables and to the gates (of the town): 'Let <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka ride out on what animal he likes, &amp;c.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had a she-elephant, called Bhaddavatikā, which could travel fifty yoga<i>n</i>as (in one day). And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a gave the ghee to king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota (saying), 'May Your Majesty drink this decoction.' Then, having made king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota drink the ghee, <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a went to the elephant stable, and hasted away from the town on the she-elephant Bhaddavatikā.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.26">1.26</a> And when king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had drunk that ghee and was digesting it, it made him vomit.

					<p class="f4">(The attendants answered), 'He has run away from the town on the she-elephant Bhaddavatikā.'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota had a slave, Kāka by name, who could travel sixty yoga<i>n</i>as (in one day), who had been begotten by a non-human being. To this slave Kāka; king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota gave the order: 'Go, my good Kāka, and call the physician <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka back <a id="pg189"><span class="f2 g"><b>[189]</b></span></a> (saying), "The king orders you to return, doctor." But those physicians, my good Kāka, are cunning people; do not accept anything from him.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.27">1.27</a> And the slave Kāka overtook <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a on his way, at Kosamb&icirc;, when he was taking his breakfast.

					<p class="f4">(<i>G</i>&icirc;vaka replied), 'Wait, my good Kāka, until we have taken our meal; here, my good Kāka, eat.'</p>

					<p class="f4">(Kāka said), 'Nay, doctor, the king has told me, "Those physicians, my good Kāka, are cunning people; do not accept anything from him."'</p>

					<p class="f4">At that time <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, who had cut off some drug with his nail, was eating an emblic myrobalan fruit and drinking water.

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.28">1.28</a> Then the slave Kāka thought: 'This physician eats the myrobalan and drinks the water; there cannot be any harm in it;' so he ate half of the myrobalan and drank some water.

					<p class="f4">Then the slave Kāka said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a: 'Can my life be saved, doctor?'</p>

					<p class="f4">Speaking thus he handed over to Kāka the she-elephant Bhaddavatikā and set out for Rā<i>g</i>agaha.

					<p class="f4">(Bimbisāra said), 'You have done right, my good <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka, that you have not returned; that king is cruel; he might have had you killed.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.29">1.29</a> And king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota, being restored to health, sent a messenger to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a (with this message), 'May <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka come to me; I will grant him a boon.'</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.30">1.30</a> At that time a disturbance had befallen the humors of the Blessed One's body.

Then the venerable &Acirc;nanda went to the place where <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a was; having approached him he said to <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a:</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.31">1.31</a> Then <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a thought: 'It is not becoming that I should give a strong purgative to the Blessed One.'

Thus he offered also the second handful of lotuses to the Blessed One (saying), 'Lord, may the Blessed One smell this second handful of lotuses; <a id="pg192"><span class="f2 g"><b>[192]</b></span></a> that will purge the Blessed One ten times.' Thus he offered also the third handful of lotuses to the Blessed One (saying), 'Lord, may the Blessed One smell this third handful of lotuses; that will purge the Blessed One ten times. Thus the Blessed One will have purged full thirty times.' And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, having given to the Blessed One a purgative for full thirty times, bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round him with his right side towards him, and went away.</p>

					<p class="f4"><a id="p1.32">1.32</a> And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, when he was out of doors, thought: 'I have given indeed to the Blessed One a purgative for full thirty times, but as the humors of the Tathāgatha's body are disturbed, it will not purge the Blessed One full thirty times; it will purge the Blessed One only twenty-nine times.

					<p class="f4">And the Blessed One, who understood by the power of his mind this reflection of <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, said to the venerable &Acirc;nanda: '<i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a, &Acirc;nanda, when he was out of doors, has thought: "I have given indeed (&amp;c., as above, down to:) thus the Blessed One will be purged full thirty times."

					<p class="f4">And <i>G</i>&icirc;vaka Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a said to the Blessed One: 'Lord, until the Blessed One's body is completely restored, you had better abstain from liquid food.' And ere long the Blessed One's body was completely restored.</p>

And glad and exalted in heart she served and offered with her own hand to the company of the Bhikkhus, with the Buddha at their head, sweet food, both hard and soft. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and had cleansed his hands and the bowl, she took her seat on one side. And, so sitting, she spake thus to the Blessed One:</p>

So also the name Kumāra-Kassapa is explained in the <i>G</i>ātaka commentary (Rh. D., 'Buddhist Birth Stories,' p. 204). The true meaning of the name, however, appears to have been different, for in Sanskrit kumārabh<i>ri</i>tyā and kaumārabh<i>ri</i>tya are technical terms for the part of the medical science which comprises the treatment of infants (see Wise, 'Commentary on the Hindu System of Medicine,' p. 3). We believe, therefore, that this surname Komārabha<i>k</i><i>k</i>a really means,' Master of the kaumārabh<i>ri</i>tya science.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n8" href="#fn8">8</a>]</sup> Mokkha<i>k</i>ikā is explained in a passage quoted by Childers sub voce and taken from the Suma&#7749;gala Vilāsin&icirc; on the 4th Ma<i>g</i><i>gh</i>ima S&icirc;la. (Compare Rh. D., 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' p. 193.) The passage from Buddhaghosa is however not devoid of ambiguity. He says: 'Mokkha<i>k</i>ikā is the feat of turning over and over. One gets hold of a staff in the air, and places his head on the ground; turning himself upside down. This is what is meant (by the word mokkha<i>k</i>ikā).' It is not clear whether the performer suspends himself by his feet from a horizontal bar fixed at a height above the ground; or whether he turns a sommersault, holding at the same time a stick in his hands. The latter seems more in accordance with the phrase 'holding a stick in the air' (ākāse da<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i> gahetvā) and with the phrase 'turning over and over' (sampariva<i>t</i><i>t</i>ana<i>m</i>).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n9" href="#fn9">9</a>]</sup> This passage in which king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota is represented as addressing king Bimbisāra by the respectful expression 'deva' may in our opinion be brought forward against Professor Jacobi's conjecture (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Gesellschaft, vol. xxxiv, p. 188) that Bimbisāra was merely a feudal chief under the supreme rule of king Pa<i>g</i><i>g</i>ota. The Pi<i>t</i>aka texts are always very exact in the selection of the terms of respect in which the different persons address each other.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n11" href="#fn11">11</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa gives two explanations of Siveyyaka<i>m</i> dussayuga<i>m</i>. 'Either Siveyyaka cloth means the cloth used in the Uttarakuru country for veiling the dead bodies when they are brought to the burying-ground (sivathikā). (A certain kind of birds take the bodies to the Himavat mountains in order to eat them, and throw the cloths away. When eremites find them there, they bring them to the king.) Or Siveyyaka cloth means a cloth woven from yarn which skilful women in the Sivi country spin.' No doubt the latter explication is the right one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n14" href="#fn14">14</a>]</sup> Itar&icirc;tara ('the one or the other') clearly refers to the two sorts of robes mentioned before, not, as Childers (s.v. itar&icirc;taro) understands it, to whether the robes are good or bad. Compare also chap. 3, §2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n16" href="#fn16">16</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: 'This king was Pasenadi's brother, the same father's son.'

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n17" href="#fn17">17</a>]</sup> Our translation of a<i>d</i><i>dh</i>akāsika<i>m</i> kambala<i>m</i> is merely conjectural. Buddhaghosa has the following note: 'A<i>d</i><i>dh</i>akāsiya<i>m</i>, here kāsi means one thousand; a thing that is worth one thousand, is called kāsiya.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n19" href="#fn19">19</a>]</sup> See chap. 1, §35.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n20" href="#fn20">20</a>]</sup> It will be as well to remind the reader that here and in the following chapters <i>k</i>&icirc;vara can mean both 'a robe' and 'cloth for making robes.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n21" href="#fn21">21</a>]</sup> Compare III, 12, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n22" href="#fn22">22</a>]</sup> Compare I, 30, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n23" href="#fn23">23</a>]</sup> The word bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>āgāra does not imply any special reference to robes more than to any other articles belonging to the Saŋgha. A good many things which were usually kept in the bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>āgāra are mentioned at <i>K</i>ullav. VI, 21, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n24" href="#fn24">24</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: 'If there are robes of the same quality, for instance, each worth ten (kāhāpa<i>n</i>as), for all Bhikkhus, it is all right; if they are not, they must take together the robes which are worth nine or eight, with those which are worth one or two, and thus they must make equal portions.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n25" href="#fn25">25</a>]</sup> 'In case the day should not suffice for distributing the robes to the Bhikkhus one by one' (Buddhaghosa).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n26" href="#fn26">26</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa: Patthinan ti (this is the reading of the Berlin MS.) atira<i>g</i>itattā thaddha<i>m</i>, i.e. 'Patthina<i>m</i> means that it had become stiff from too much dye.' Th&icirc;na or thinna is Sanskrit styāna.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n27" href="#fn27">27</a>]</sup> That is, made of untorn cloth. See VIII, 21, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n28" href="#fn28">28</a>]</sup> These are always mentioned in connection with Rā<i>g</i>agaha (Mahāvagga I, 53 <i>K</i>ullavagga XI, 1-10), and are probably the name of the mountainous district immediately south of Rā<i>g</i>agaha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n29" href="#fn29">29</a>]</sup> A<i>k</i><i>k</i>ibaddhan (sic) ti <i>k</i>aturassakedārakabaddha<i>m</i> (B.). I have never seen a field divided 'ray-fashion,' which would apparently be the literal translation of the term, and it is difficult to see how the necessary water could be conducted from strip to strip of a field so divided.

This latter explanation from bāhā seems evidently more correct than the other one from bahi; and we accordingly follow it.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n43" href="#fn43">43</a>]</sup> See the end of the last chapter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n44" href="#fn44">44</a>]</sup> Satta-l&ucirc;kha; in which compound the signification of satta is by no means clear. Buddhaghosa has no note upon it. Now it is curious that in chapter 21, below, it is laid down that the robe is to be sutta-l&ucirc;kha, the meaning of which would fit this passage excellently. We have accordingly adopted that reading here.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n45" href="#fn45">45</a>]</sup> Compare the similar expressions at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 8 and 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n46" href="#fn46">46</a>]</sup> The general sense of this chapter is clear enough. As an Indian field, the common property of the village community, was divided, for the purposes of cultivation, across and across, so must also the Bhikkhu's robe be divided. That some, both of the agricultural and of the tailoring terms, should now be unintelligible to us is not surprising. Buddhaghosa himself, as the extracts from his commentary show, was not certain of the meaning of them all.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n47" href="#fn47">47</a>]</sup> Ubbha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ite <i>k</i>&icirc;varehi. The former word is of course applied to the Bhikkhus. Compare Childers, under Bha<i>n</i><i>d</i>ikā, and <i>G</i>ātaka I, 504 (last line but one).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n48" href="#fn48">48</a>]</sup> Bhis&icirc; = Sanskrit B<i>ri</i>s&icirc;. Compare the 14th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, where we ought to have rendered the word 'bolster.' Childers is incorrect in translating it by 'mat'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n49" href="#fn49">49</a>]</sup> Mentioned also, as being near to Vesāl&icirc;, in the 'Book of the Great Decease,' III, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n50" href="#fn50">50</a>]</sup> Bāhullāya āvattā. This phrase occurs in Mahāvagga I, 31, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n51" href="#fn51">51</a>]</sup> See our note on the same phrase at Mahāvagga I, 20, 15.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n52" href="#fn52">52</a>]</sup> Nandimukhiyā rattiyā. The derivation of this phrase is uncertain, though the general meaning is not subject to doubt. The Sanskrit form of the whole phrase will be found in the Lalita Vistara at p. 447. Comp. <i>S</i>ā&#7749;khāyana-g<i>ri</i>hya, ed. Oldenberg, IV, 4, where the word nānd&icirc;mukho occurs in a different connection.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n53" href="#fn53">53</a>]</sup> In the text read Ye pi kho kulaputtā. The idea is that men of lower grade, being accustomed to cold, would not want so many robes. But there must be one rule for all; and the rule is accordingly made to suit the comfort of the weaker brethren--early Buddhism, contrary to an erroneous opinion still frequently ex-pressed, being opposed to asceticism.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n54" href="#fn54">54</a>]</sup> Or, 'to get on with the three robes.' Compare the use of yāpetu<i>m</i> in the 'Book of the Great Decease,' II, 32.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n55" href="#fn55">55</a>]</sup> Eka<i>k</i><i>k</i>iya<i>m</i>. Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 326. Buddhaghosa says dvigu<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> dupa<i>t</i><i>t</i>a-sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i<i>m</i> eka<i>k</i><i>k</i>iya<i>m</i> ekapa<i>t</i><i>t</i>a<i>m</i>. Though 'single,' the lengths of cotton cloth, pieced together, of which the robes were made, were allowed to be doubled at the seams, the collar, the elbows, and the knees. See above, VII, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n56" href="#fn56">56</a>]</sup> The waist cloth (sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i) was wrapped round the waist and back, and secured with a girdle. The under garment (antaravāsaka; see also the end of this note) was wrapped round the loins and reached below the knee, being fastened round the loins by an end of the cloth being tucked in there; and sometimes also by a girdle. The upper robe (uttarāsa<i>m</i>ga) was wrapped round the legs from the loins to the ankles, and the end was then drawn, at the back, from the right hip, over the left shoulder, and either (as is still the custom in Siam, and in the Siamese sect in Ceylon) allowed to fall down in front, or (as is still the custom in Burma, and in the Burmese sect in Ceylon) drawn back again over the right shoulder, and allowed to fall down on the back. From the constant reference to the practice of adjusting the robe over one shoulder as a special mark of respect (for instance, Mahāvagga I, 29, 2; IV, 3. 3), the' Burmese custom would seem to be in accordance with the most ancient way of usually wearing the robe. The oldest statues of the Buddha, which represent the robe as falling over only one shoulder, are probably later than the passages just referred to.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The ordinary dress of laymen, even of good family, in Gotama's time was much more scanty than the decent dress thus prescribed for the Bhikkhus. See Rh. D.'s note on the 'Book of the Great Decease,' VI, 26. But it consisted also, like that of the Bhikkhus, not in garments made with sleeves or trousers, to fit the limbs, but in simple lengths of cloth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The antara-vāsaka corresponds, in the dress of the monks, to the sā<i>t</i>ika in the dress of ordinary women, and was of the same shape as the udaka-sā<i>t</i>ika, or bathing dress, prescribed for the use both of monks (below, chapter 15) and of nuns (Bhikkhun&icirc;vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXII). The latter was, however, somewhat shorter.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">The ordinary dress of the Bhikkhun&icirc;s or Sisters consisted of the same three garments as that of the Bhikkhus.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n57" href="#fn57">57</a>]</sup> That is, according to the first Nissaggiya. The first section of the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on that rule is identical with this section.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n58" href="#fn58">58</a>]</sup> So the first Nissaggiya; the second section of the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga on which rule is identical with this section 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n59" href="#fn59">59</a>]</sup> On vikappetu<i>m</i>, compare our note above, the 59th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya, and below, chapters 20, 22.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n60" href="#fn60">60</a>]</sup> See above, VIII, 13, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n61" href="#fn61">61</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Agga<i>t</i>a<i>m</i> a<i>k</i><i>kh</i>ādeyyan (sic) ti <i>kh</i>inna<i>t</i><i>th</i>āne pilotika-kha<i>n</i><i>d</i>am laggāpeyya<i>m</i>. The word occurs at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 8, where the liability to want such an insertion is given as one of the nine disadvantages of a robe from the ascetic's point of view.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n62" href="#fn62">62</a>]</sup> Ahata-kappāna<i>m</i>. See above, VII, 1, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n63" href="#fn63">63</a>]</sup> See our notes on these expressions above, VII, 1, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n64" href="#fn64">64</a>]</sup> This liability to have to be patched is given, in connection with the previous phrase, as one of the nine disadvantages of robes at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 8; and tunnavāya occurs as the expression for a mender of old clothes at <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 5, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n65" href="#fn65">65</a>]</sup> See our notes on these expressions above, VII, 1, 5.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n66" href="#fn66">66</a>]</sup> <i>K</i>ātudd&icirc;piko, literally, 'over the four continents,' into which the world was supposed to be divided. Compare Genesis vii. 44.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n67" href="#fn67">67</a>]</sup> Ga<i>k</i><i>kh</i>a <i>g</i>e; where <i>g</i>e is the appropriate form of address invariably used to a female slave or maid-servant. Compare Childers, in the 'Dictionary,' p. 617.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n68" href="#fn68">68</a>]</sup> Ko<i>t</i><i>th</i>aka does not only mean a room, as given by Childers: it signifies here, as at <i>G</i>ātaka I, 227, a battlemented dwelling, the house of a person of rank.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n69" href="#fn69">69</a>]</sup> See our note on this phrase at I, 54, 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n70" href="#fn70">70</a>]</sup> See below, the note on §15.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n71" href="#fn71">71</a>]</sup> Compare sukhā vihāyati in the Sigālovāda Sutta at p. 302 of Grimblot's 'Sept Suttas Pālis.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n72" href="#fn72">72</a>]</sup> Compare Uss&ucirc;ra-seyyo in the Sigālovāda Sutta at p. 302 of Grimblot's 'Sept Suttas Pālis;' and B&ouml;htlingk-Roth, under uts&ucirc;ra.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n73" href="#fn73">73</a>]</sup> Bhatta<i>k</i><i>kh</i>eda<i>m</i> karissati, because he may not eat solid food after sun-turn.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n74" href="#fn74">74</a>]</sup> See Mahāvagga VI, 24. The ten advantages are enumerated in §5 there.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n75" href="#fn75">75</a>]</sup> In the text read <i>k</i>i<i>n</i><i>n</i>ena. Compare Bhikkhun&icirc;-vibha&#7749;ga, Pā<i>k</i>ittiya XXI, 1, where the whole passage recurs. The first sentence also recurs ibid., Pā<i>k</i>ittiya II.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n76" href="#fn76">76</a>]</sup> A conversation of the kind here referred to is related, as having actually taken place at Nādika, in the 'Book of the Great Decease,' II, 5-8.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n77" href="#fn77">77</a>]</sup> The succession of ideas in this paragraph is very suggestive, and throws much light both upon the psychological views and upon the religious feelings of the early Buddhists. The exact rendering of course of the abstract terms employed in the Pāli text is no doubt, as yet, beset with difficulty, for the reasons pointed out in Rh. D.'s 'Buddhist Suttas from the Pāli,' pp. xxv, xxvi; but the general sense of the passage is already sufficiently clear. For one or two words we have no real and adequate equivalent.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Kāya is neither 'body' nor 'faculties;' it is the whole frame, the whole individuality, looked at rather objectively than subjectively, and rather from the outward and visible than from the inner, metaphysical, stand-point. Compare the use of Sakkāya-di<i>t</i><i>th</i>i and of Kāyena passati.</p>

					<p class="lgqt">Sukha is not so much 'happiness,' simply and vaguely, as the serenity of the bliss which follows on happiness. It is contrasted with, and follows after, pāmo<i>g</i><i>g</i>a and p&icirc;ti, in the same way as in this passage, in the standing description of the <i>Gh</i>ānas (translated by Rh. D. in the Mahā-sudassana Sutta II, 5-8, in the 'Buddhist Suttas,' p. 272). Its opposite, Dukkha, is a positive state of pain, and in comparison with this, sukha is negative, the absence of pain.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><i>K</i>itta is always more emotional than intellectual. It has the connotation, not of 'mind,' as is usually and erroneously supposed, but of 'heart.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n78" href="#fn78">78</a>]</sup> The size of such a garment is limited by the 91st Pā<i>k</i>ittiya to six spans by two-and-a-half--that is just enough to go round the loins from the waist half down to the knee. It would be decent, and yet avoid the disadvantage of wearing the robes in the rain, where they would become wet and heavy in the manner described, for instance, at Mahāvagga VII, 1, 1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n79" href="#fn79">79</a>]</sup>The remainder of this introductory story scarcely bears translation. The first sentences recur in the Sutta-vibha&#7749;ga, Sa<i>m</i>ghādisesa I, 2, I, and Pā<i>k</i>ittiya V, 1, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n80" href="#fn80">80</a>]</sup> The length of a mat (nis&icirc;dana<i>m</i>) was limited by the 89th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya to two spans by one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n81" href="#fn81">81</a>]</sup> This introductory story is also given as the introduction to Mahāvagga VI, 9.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n82" href="#fn82">82</a>]</sup>  According to the 90th Pā<i>k</i>ittiya such a cloth must not be more than four spans in length, and two in breadth.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n83" href="#fn83">83</a>]</sup> He is also mentioned as such in Mahāvagga VI, 36.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n84" href="#fn84">84</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, &Acirc;lapito ti mama santaka<i>m</i> ga<i>n</i>hāhi ya<i>m</i> i<i>k</i><i>kh</i>eyyās&icirc;ti eva<i>m</i> vutto.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n85" href="#fn85">85</a>]</sup> Vissāsa<i>m</i> gahetu<i>m</i>, on which phrase compare vissāsā ga<i>n</i>hāti in chapter 31, below, where the context leaves no doubt as to its meaning.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n86" href="#fn86">86</a>]</sup> Compare <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 13.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n87" href="#fn87">87</a>]</sup> Compare the passages given in the index to the text of the <i>K</i>ullavagga, p. 355, s.v. thavikā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n94" href="#fn94">94</a>]</sup> Vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>o ti suttam a<i>ñ</i><i>k</i>itvā sibbantāna<i>m</i> eko sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i-ko<i>n</i>o digho hoti, says Buddhaghosa. Vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>aka in the 233rd <i>G</i>ātaka seems to mean 'harpoon.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n95" href="#fn95">95</a>]</sup> Vika<i>n</i><i>n</i>am uddharitun ti d&icirc;gha-ko<i>n</i>a<i>m</i> <i>kh</i>inditu<i>m</i> (B.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n96" href="#fn96">96</a>]</sup> Okirat&icirc; (sic) ti <i>kh</i>inna-ko<i>n</i>ato ga<i>l</i>ati (B.). Ga<i>l</i>ati at VI, r3, 1, is 'ran over,' whereas okiriyanti at the corresponding passages VI, 12, 1, 2, is 'were spilt.' Probably the above rendering is the real meaning here, as the threads could not be literally spilt or sprinkled.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n97" href="#fn97">97</a>]</sup> On these difficult technical terms Buddhaghosa provokingly says, anuvāta<i>m</i> paribha<i>n</i><i>d</i>am anuvāta<i>ñ</i> <i>k</i>&#8217; eva paribha<i>n</i><i>d</i>a<i>m</i>. Childers, under the first, has merely 'with the wind,' and under the second, 'girdle.' The same expressions occur also above, at VII, 1, 5, where Buddhaghosa, again only explains the words by the words themselves.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n98" href="#fn98">98</a>]</sup> We probably ought to read pa<i>t</i><i>t</i>ā, not pattā; but what is meant by the ribbons of the sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i is very doubtful. Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n99" href="#fn99">99</a>]</sup> For lu<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati compare palu<i>g</i><i>g</i>ati.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n100" href="#fn100">100</a>]</sup> What this is&nbsp;is again uncertain, and Buddhaghosa gives no help.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n101" href="#fn101">101</a>]</sup> See above, chapter 11, at the end.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n102" href="#fn102">102</a>]</sup> Anvādhika<i>m</i>, on which Buddhaghosa says nothing.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n103" href="#fn103">103</a>]</sup> Compare the 1st and 3rd Nissaggiyas, and above, VIII, 13, 8, as to the rules concerning extra robes, and what is to be done with them.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n104" href="#fn104">104</a>]</sup> For the rule as to such depositing, see the 29th Nissaggiya. <i>K</i>&icirc;vara (robe) must here be used for Sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i. See our note on VIII, 13, 5, and section 2, below, where sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i occurs.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n105" href="#fn105">105</a>]</sup> On Santaruttara, see the 7th Nissaggiya. It is clear from this passage that Buddhaghosa was right in his limitation of the word as used in that rule; and we should have done better, therefore, to follow it in our translation of the rule.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n106" href="#fn106">106</a>]</sup> Compare the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Sekhiyas, and the 2nd Nissaggiya; and also above, VII, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n107" href="#fn107">107</a>]</sup> Here the word used is Sa<i>m</i>ghā<i>t</i>i.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n108" href="#fn108">108</a>]</sup> On sa<i>m</i>keta, compare II, 8, 1. Buddhaghosa merely says here, Vassika-sa<i>m</i>ketan ti <i>k</i>attāro māse. As sa<i>m</i>keta implies a mutual agreement, the 'appointed time' here probably means, not the time fixed by the Buddha, but the time agreed upon by the Saŋgha as that to which the rule laid down by the Buddha should apply. There may easily have arisen questions as to the exact day on which the four months should properly begin; and there were even differences of opinion as to the exact length of the period itself, some making it three, and some four months. See on these points Childers, under Vassa and Vass&ucirc;panāyikā.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n109" href="#fn109">109</a>]</sup> From fear of thieves.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n110" href="#fn110">110</a>]</sup> See the and Nissaggiya, and above, VII, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n111" href="#fn111">111</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa has nothing on this reason. It would seem that the garment in question might be left behind when the Bhikkhu had to go on a journey, if that journey would take him beyond the boundary of the technical 'residence.' On the use of the word, see the passages collected by H.-O. in the Index to the Pāli Text (vol. ii. p. 349, s.v. s&icirc;mā.).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n112" href="#fn112">112</a>]</sup> It is evident from this last reason that the reasons are not such as would justify a Bhikkhu in laying aside the garment in such a way as to remain naked, but such as would justify him in not using the rainy-season garment when he might otherwise have done so. In the five cases mentioned he might wear the nether garment only reaching from above the navel to below the knees, instead of the garment for the rainy season, which was smaller in size. See our note above on VIII, 13, 5, and VIII, 15, 15.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n113" href="#fn113">113</a>]</sup> That is, spent the rainy season.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n114" href="#fn114">114</a>]</sup> This is laid down in Mahāvagga IX, 4, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n115" href="#fn115">115</a>]</sup> And thereby the Ka<i>th</i>ina license suspended. Compare the 1st, and, and 3rd Nissaggiyas, and our note on p. 18.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n116" href="#fn116">116</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Utukālan ti vassānato a<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a<i>m</i> kāla<i>m</i>, where vassāna means the rainy season. See Abhidhānappad&icirc;pikā, verse 79.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n117" href="#fn117">117</a>]</sup> On this sense of adhi<i>t</i><i>th</i>ātu<i>m</i>, see above, Mahāvagga VIII, 20, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n118" href="#fn118">118</a>]</sup> Akāmā; on which compare II, 27, 15, and especially II, 34, 3, and IV, 17, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n119" href="#fn119">119</a>]</sup> &Acirc;gamma, which is here nearly the same as uddissa. To give the full import of the expression it would be necessary to say, have come to us in consequence of the inducement offered to the givers by the presence of the Theras here.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n120" href="#fn120">120</a>]</sup> See our note above on §1.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n121" href="#fn121">121</a>]</sup> There is a Sā<i>n</i>avāsi who takes a prominent part at the Council of Vesāl&icirc; (<i>K</i>ullavagga XII, 1, 8; XII, 2, 4). He is probably meant to be considered the same as this one.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n122" href="#fn122">122</a>]</sup> Section 1 repeated, with the necessary change of person, &amp;c.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n123" href="#fn123">123</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Ekādhippāyan ti eka<i>m</i> adhippāya<i>m</i>. Eka-puggala-pa<i>t</i>ivisa<i>m</i> eva dethā ti attho.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n124" href="#fn124">124</a>]</sup> On all except the last two this duty has already been enjoined above in the passages on the mutual duties of masters and pupils (Mahāvagga I, 24, 25; I, 26, II; I, 32, 3; I, 33, r).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n125" href="#fn125">125</a>]</sup> Compare <i>G</i>ātaka II, 293, 294.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n126" href="#fn126">126</a>]</sup> This last clause occurs also above, at I, 49, 6.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n127" href="#fn127">127</a>]</sup> That is, he died.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n128" href="#fn128">128</a>]</sup> There is only one, not three Kammavā<i>k</i>ās, given in the text.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n129" href="#fn129">129</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 15, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n130" href="#fn130">130</a>]</sup> See <i>K</i>ullavagga VI, 16, 2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n131" href="#fn131">131</a>]</sup> That is, 'of all the world.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n132" href="#fn132">132</a>]</sup> This description of the totality of the Saŋgha is constantly found in dedicatory inscriptions. See Rh. D.'s paper in the Indian Antiquary, May, 1872.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n133" href="#fn133">133</a>]</sup> So, for example, in <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 1, 3.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n134" href="#fn134">134</a>]</sup> Compare above, VIII, 15, 7 and 11.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n135" href="#fn135">135</a>]</sup> This is several times referred to in the <i>G</i>ātakas; for instance, pp. 6, 9, 12.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n136" href="#fn136">136</a>]</sup> Perhaps made of leaves. Compare B&ouml;htlingk-Roth's, No. 5, sub voce; and <i>G</i>ātaka I, 304 (phalakattharasayana). Perhaps also <i>G</i>ātaka I, 356, 'making a man his phalaka,' may be a figure of speech founded on this use of the word, and mean 'making him his covering.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n137" href="#fn137">137</a>]</sup> Like the well-known Titthiya A<i>g</i>ita, one of the six great heretics (Sāma<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a-phala Sutta, ed. Grimblot, p. 114, Book of the Great Decease, V, 60).</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n138" href="#fn138">138</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa, at Suttavibha&#7749;ga, Pārā<i>g</i>ika I, 10, 3, where this word occurs, says on it, A<i>g</i>inakkhikan (sic) ti saloma<i>m</i> sakhura<i>m</i> agina-miga-<i>k</i>amma<i>m</i>. Compare also above, Mahāvagga V. 4.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n139" href="#fn139">139</a>]</sup> Titthiya-dha<i>g</i>a. Compare <i>G</i>ātaka I, 65, and <i>K</i>ullavagga I, 2 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n140" href="#fn140">140</a>]</sup> Akkanā<i>l</i>an ti akkanā<i>l</i>amaya<i>m</i> (B.). Compare B&ouml;htlingk-Roth, under arka.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n141" href="#fn141">141</a>]</sup> Potthako ti maka<i>k</i>imayo vu<i>k</i><i>k</i>ati (B.). So also Childers, sub voce.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n142" href="#fn142">142</a>]</sup> See Buddhaghosa's explanations of all these colours in the note on V, 2, I.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n143" href="#fn143">143</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says on this word, Tir&icirc;tan (sic) ti pana rukkha<i>kh</i>allimaya<i>m</i>, ta<i>m</i> pāda-pun<i>kh</i>ana<i>m</i> kātu<i>m</i> va<i>t</i><i>t</i>ati. <i>Kh</i>alli is 'bark.'</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n144" href="#fn144">144</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says that the robes of the colours mentioned in this chapter may be worn if they have first been dyed, or may be used as coverlets, or may be cut up and used as parts of robes. So the robes with skirts to them may be worn if the forbidden skirts have first been torn or cut off.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n145" href="#fn145">145</a>]</sup> The above list of disqualifications has already occurred at II, 36; IV, 14.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n146" href="#fn146">146</a>]</sup> There is no doubt that this is the meaning here of udaka. Compare above, Mahāvagga I, 22, 18, and <i>G</i>ātaka I, 93; III, 286; D&icirc;pava<i>m</i>sa XIII, 29.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n147" href="#fn147">147</a>]</sup> That is, in trust that the venerable Revata, if he knew that the Bhikkhu wanted it, would have given it to him. See above, Mahāvagga VIII, 19.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n148" href="#fn148">148</a>]</sup> On this meaning of adhiti<i>t</i><i>th</i>ati, see our note above, VIII, 20,2; VIII, 24,2.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n149" href="#fn149">149</a>]</sup> The reason of all this is, that if the sender (A) says to the messenger (B), 'Give this robe to the sendee (C),' the property in the robe does not pass; if A says to B, 'I give this robe to C,' it does pass.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n150" href="#fn150">150</a>]</sup> Mātikā; used in the same sense here as at VII, 1, 7.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n151" href="#fn151">151</a>]</sup> That is, of monks and nuns--the Bhikkhu--sa<i>m</i>gha and the Bhikkhun&icirc;-sa<i>m</i>gha.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n152" href="#fn152">152</a>]</sup> See chapters II, 6 and following.</p>

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n153" href="#fn153">153</a>]</sup> Buddhaghosa says, Bhikkhā-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>attiyā, ti attano pari<i>k</i><i>k</i>āgapa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>a-pa<i>ñ</i><i>ñ</i>apana-t<i>th</i>āne. Ten&#8217; ev&#8217; āha yattha sa<i>m</i>ghassa dhuvakārā kariyant&icirc; ti.

					<p class="lgqt"><sup>[<a id="n154" href="#fn154">154</a>]</sup> That is, he invites a number of Bhikkhus to partake of yāgu, and when the yāgu is served he says, 'I give robes to those who have partaken of the yāgu,' and so on in all the other cases except that of robes. In that case he says, 'I give robes to those who have previously received robes from me' (B.).</p>
