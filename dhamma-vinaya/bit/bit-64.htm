					Sublime State of Friendliness</b></p>

					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Culla-Vagga (v.6.)</p>

					<p>Now at that time a certain priest had been killed by the bite of a snake, and when they announced the matter to The Blessed One, he said:</p>

					<p>"Surely now, O priests, that priest never suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For if, O priests, that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. And what are the four royal families of the snakes? The Virūpakkhas are a royal family of snakes; the Erāpathas are a royal family of snakes; the Chabyāputtas are a royal family of snakes; the KanhāGotamakas are a royal family of snakes. Surely, now, O priests, that priest did not suffuse the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness. For surely, O priests, if that priest had suffused the four royal families of the snakes with his friendliness, that priest, O priests, would not have been killed by the bite of a snake. I enjoin, O priests, that ye suffuse these four royal families of the snakes with your friendliness; and that ye sing a song of defence for your protection and safeguard. After this manner, O priests, shall ye sing:</p>

										<p class="ctr">"Virūpakkhas, I love them all,<br />
										The Erāpathas, too, I love,<br />
										Chabyāputtas, I love them, too,<br />
										And all KanhāGotamakas.</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_303">303</a>]</p>

										<p class="ctr">"'Creatures without feet have my love,<br />
										And likewise those that have two feet,<br />
										And those that have four feet I love,<br />
										And those, too, that have many feet.<br />
										&nbsp;<br />
										"'May those without feet harm me not,<br />
										And those with two feet cause no hurt;<br />
										May those with four feet harm me not,<br />
										Nor those who many feet possess.<br />
										&nbsp;<br />
										"'Let creatures all, all things that live,<br />
										All beings of whatever kind,<br />
										See nothing that will bode them ill!<br />
										May naught of evil come to them!</p>

					<p>"'Infinite is The Buddha, infinite the Doctrine, infinite the Order! Finite are creeping things: snakes, scorpions, centipedes, spiders, lizards, and mice! I have now made my protection, and sung my song of defence. Let all living beings retreat! I revere The Blessed One, and the seven Supreme Buddhas!'"</p>
