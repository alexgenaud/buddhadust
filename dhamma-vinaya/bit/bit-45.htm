					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Milindapañha (32.12)</p>

					<p>"Bhante Nāgasena," said the king, "are there any who die without being born into another existence?"</p>

					<p>"Some are born into another existence," said the elder, "and some are not born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"Who is born into another existence, and who is not born into another existence?"</p>

					<p>"Your majesty, he that still has the corruptions is born into another existence; he that no longer has the corruptions is not born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"But will you, bhante, be born into another existence?"</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_233">233</a>] "Your majesty, if there shall be in me any attachment, I shall be born into another existence; if there shall be in me no attachment, I shall not be born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"You are an able man, bhante Nāgasena."</p>
