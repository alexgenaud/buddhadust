					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Milindapañha (60.10)</p>

					<p>"Bhante Nāgasena, what is contact?"</p>

					<p>"Your majesty, contact is the act of coming in contact."</p>

					<p>"Give an illustration."</p>

					<p>"It is as if, your majesty, two rams were to fight one another. The eye is comparable to one of these rams, form to the other, and contact to their collision with each other."</p>

					<p>"Give another illustration."</p>

					<p>[<a id="page_187">187</a>]"It is as if, your majesty, the two hands were to be clapped together. The eye is comparable to one hand, form to the other, and contact to their collision with each other."</p>

					<p>"Give another illustration."</p>

					<p>"It is as if, your majesty, two cymbals were to be clapped together. The eye is comparable to one cymbal, form to the other, and contact to their collision with each other."</p>

					<p>"You are an able man, bhante Nāgasena."</p>
