					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Samyutta-Nikāya (<a href="../../backmatter/indexes/sutta/sn/03_kv/idx_22_khandhasamyutta.htm#p1">sn 3 22.1</a>)</p>

					<p>"We may have, O householder, a learned and noble disciple, who is a follower of noble disciples, conversant with the Noble Doctrine, disciplined in the Noble Doctrine, a follower of good people, conversant with the Doctrine held by good people, disciplined in the Doctrine held by good people. He does not consider form in the light of an Ego -- neither the Ego as possessing form, nor form as comprised in the Ego, nor the Ego as comprised in form -- and is thus not possessed with the idea, 'I am form; form belongs to the I.' And not being possessed with the idea, 'I am form; form belongs to the I,' when form alters and changes, the alteration and change of form do not cause sorrow, lamentation, grief, and despair to arise in him.</p>

					<p>"He does not consider sensation . . . perception . . . the predispositions . . . consciousness in the light of an Ego-- neither the Ego as possessing consciousness, nor consciousness as comprised in the Ego, nor the Ego as comprised in consciousness--and is thus not possessed with the idea, 'I am consciousness; consciousness belongs to the I.' And not being possessed with the idea, 'I am consciousness; consciousness belongs to the I,' when consciousness alters and changes, the alteration and change of consciousness do not cause sorrow, lamentation, grief, and despair to arise in him.</p>

					<p>"Thus, O householder, is one wretched of body but not wretched of mind."</p>

					<p>Thus spake the venerable Sāriputta, and the delighted householder Nakulapitā applauded the speech of the venerable Sāriputta.</p>
