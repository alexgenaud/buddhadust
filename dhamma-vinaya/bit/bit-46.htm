					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Milindapañha
					(41.11)</p>

					<p>"Bhante Nāgasena," said the king, "does a man know when he is not to be born into another existence?"</p>

					<p>"Assuredly, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"Bhante, how does he know it?"</p>

					<p>"He knows it from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"Give an illustration."</p>

					<p>"It is as if, your majesty, a house-holding farmer were to plow and sow and fill his granary; and then were neither to plow nor sow, and were to use the grain previously stored up, or give it away, or do with it however else might suit him: your majesty, would this house-holding farmer know that his granary would not become filled up again?"</p>

					<p>"Assuredly, bhante, would he know it."</p>

					<p>"How would he know it?"</p>

					<p>"He would know it from the cessation of all cause or reason for the filling up of the granary."</p>

					<p>"In exactly the same way, your majesty, a man knows when he is not to be born into another existence, from the cessation of all cause or reason for being born into another existence."</p>

					<p>"You are an able man, bhante Nāgasena."</p>
