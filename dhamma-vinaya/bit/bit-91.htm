					<p>"Yes, Reverend Sir."</p>

					<p>"So it appears, O priests, that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of life in heaven, heavenly beauty, heavenly happiness, heavenly glory; that ye are distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe the idea of heavenly power. But much more, O priests, should ye be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the body; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the voice; be distressed at, ashamed of, and loathe doing evil with the mind."</p>
