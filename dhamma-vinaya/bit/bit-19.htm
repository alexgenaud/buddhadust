					<p class="ctr c f4"><b>§ 19. What Is Unity Or One?</b><br />
					The Wish-free Birth-Story</p>

					<p class="ctr f2">Translated from the Jātaka (ii.257.13), and constituting Birth-Story 244.</p>

					<p>"<i>What he sees he does not wish for.</i>" This was related by The Teacher while dwelling in Jetavana monastery, and it was concerning a certain wandering ascetic who ran away.</p>

					<p>It seems this ascetic had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions; and coming to Sāvatthi, he inquired, "Who is able to debate with me?" On hearing it said, "The Supreme Buddha is able," he went to Jetavana monastery, surrounded by a crowd of people. There he saw The Blessed One in the midst of the four classes of his disciples teaching them the Doctrine; and he propounded to him his questions.</p>

					<p>Then The Teacher answered him, and in return asked, "What constitutes a unit?" And he, being unable to reply, rose up and ran away.</p>

					<p>And they of the assembly said, --</p>

					<p>"Reverend Sir, you silenced the wandering ascetic with the question concerning the unit."</p>

					<p>Said The Teacher, --</p>

					<p>"Not now for the first time, O lay disciples, have I silenced him with the question concerning the unit; formerly also did I do so."</p>

					<p>So saying, he related the by-gone occurrence: --</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, when Brahmadatta was ruling at Benares, the Future Buddha was born in the family of a Brahman of that kingdom. When he was come of age, he renounced pleasures and adopted the life of a holy recluse, and dwelt for a long time in the Himalaya Mountains. And descending from the hills, he made his abode in a leaf-hut close by a market-village, at a bend of the Ganges.</p>

					<p>And a certain wandering ascetic who had not found any one throughout the whole continent of India to refute his propositions, [<a id="page_154">154</a>] came to that market-village, and inquired, "Is there any one here able to debate with me?" And hearing that the Future Buddha was able, he went to his dwelling-place, surrounded by a crowd of people, and greeting him politely, sat down.</p>

					<p>And the Future Buddha said to him, --</p>

					<p>"Will you have a drink of Ganges water, fragrant with the scent of the forest?"</p>

					<p>Thereupon the wandering ascetic began volubly to debate, saying, --</p>

					<p>"What is the Ganges? Is the sand the Ganges? Is the water the Ganges? Is the hither bank the Ganges? Is the further bank the Ganges?"</p>

					<p>But the Future Buddha said to him, --</p>

					<p>"If you except the water, the sand, the hither bank, and the further bank, where can you find any Ganges?"</p>

					<p>The wandering ascetic was confounded, and rose up and ran away.</p>

					<p>When he was gone, the Future Buddha began teaching the Doctrine to the assembly that was seated about, and spoke the following stanzas: --</p>

							<p class="in2">"What he sees he does not wish for,<br />
							But something that he does not see;<br />
							Methinks that he will wander long,<br />
							And what he wishes, not obtain.<br />
							&nbsp;<br />
							"He is not pleased with what he gets;<br />
							No sooner gained, it meets his scorn.<br />
							Insatiate are wishes all!<br />
							The wish-free, therefore, we adore!"</p>

					<p>Here:-</p>

					<p><span class="f2"><i>What he sees</i>: -- The water etc. which he sees, he does not wish to regard as the Ganges.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					<i>But something that he does not see</i>: --
					But he wishes for a Ganges he does not see, for one abstracted from water etc.<br />
					&nbsp;<br />
					<i>Methinks that he will wander long</i>: -- Methinks thus: "This wandering ascetic, in his search for such a Ganges, will wander long; or if, in [<a id="page_155">155</a>] the same manner as for this Ganges abstracted from water etc., he is in search of an Ego abstracted from form etc., he will wander a long time in the round of rebirth."<br />
					<i>And what he wishes, not obtain</i>: -- Although he wander a long time, he will not find such a Ganges or Ego as he is looking for.<br />
					&nbsp;<br /><i>What he gets</i>: -- He is not pleased with the water, or the form etc., which he gets.<br />
					&nbsp;<br /><i>No sooner gained, it meets his scorn</i>: -- Being thus not pleased with what he gets, any longed-for success which he gains, this he scorns and despises, saying, "What do I care for this?"<br />
					&nbsp;<br /><i>Insatiate are wishes all</i>: -- Wish or desire is insatiate, as it continually seeks for a fresh object which it scorns as soon as obtained.<br />
					&nbsp;<br /><i>The wish-free, therefore, we adore</i>: -- Therefore we adore The Buddhas and all others who are free from wishes.</span></p>

					<p>When The Teacher had given this instruction, he identified the characters in the Birth-Story: "The wandering ascetic of that existence was the wandering ascetic of this. The anchorite was I myself."</p>
