					<p>Now in the same world-cycle that saw Dīpamkara, The One Possessing the Ten Forces, there were also three other Buddhas; but as none of them prophesied concerning the Future Buddha, I have not mentioned them. In the Commentary, however, all the Buddhas are mentioned from the beginning of that world-cycle on, as follows: -- </p>

					<p>Our Future Buddha, in his passage through four immensities and a hundred thousand world-cycles to the present time, [<a id="page_33">33</a>] has made his wish under twenty-four of these Buddhas beginning with Dīpamkara. But since Kassapa, The Blessed One, there has been no Supreme Buddha excepting our present one. Accordingly, our Future Buddha has received recognition at the hands of twenty-four Buddhas beginning with Dīpamkara.</p>
