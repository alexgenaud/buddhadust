					<p class="f4">Special Thanks should be given to Alex Genaud for his long-time generous hosting of this material on his site. To this must now be added my gratitude for the work he has done on the reorganization of the <a href="../backmatter/glossology/ped/pts_ped/ped.htm">Pali-English Dictionary.</a> What he has done enabled the English language sorting of terms thus making it accessible to thousands of people world-wide. It could not have been done witout his work.</p>

					<p>The poem "BuddhaDust" that heads this page is in the form of the antecedent to the Haiku called a "Tanka". The Tanka is constructed using five lines with 5,7,5,7, and 7 syllables respectively. The Tanka was originally conceived as a way to praise the Awakened and at one point it took the form of a dialog between poets who linked responses in a form called the Renga. You Awakeners out there inspired to praise Gotama are invited to revive this tradition. We have set up a <a href="../dhammatalk/dhammatalk_forum/tanka.htm">Renga</a> section in the Forum.</p>
