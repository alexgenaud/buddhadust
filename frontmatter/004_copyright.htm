					<p>The <i>Pāli</i> Texts herein were Adapted from the 1995 edition of the digital version of the Sri Lanka Buddha Jayanti Tripitaka Series and carry no copyright.<br />
					The translations of Sister Upalavana are in the Public Domain.</p>

					<h4>Works adapted from Access to Insight</h4>

					<p>Works adapted from Access to Insight are so indicated under the 'translator' line on the individual works except in the case of Bhikkhu Thanissaro all of whose work originates from that source.<br />
					The translations of Bhikkhu Thanissaro are copyrighted by him and are made available through Access to Insight [<a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org">http://www.accesstoinsight.org</a>]. Terms of use are as follows: "You may download these files to your computer, print them out, read them, share them with your friends, copy them to your own website, translate them into other languages, and redistribute them electronically — provided that you do not charge any money for them. They are not in the public domain. You may reformat the files as you please, but you may not change their content without first obtaining permission from the author, translator, or publisher."<br />
					These same terms apply to the works of other translators whose works have been adapted from Access to Insight.</p>

					<h1>Discussion of terms of use:</h1>

					<p>[Adopted from the similar discussion of <a href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/faq.html#copyright">terms of use</a> found on Access to Insight]</p>

					<h4>In Brief:</h4>

					<p>You may copy and redistribute any texts from this website provided that with the exception of the works of obo and those works which are in the Public Domain or which otherwise carry no restrictions, you do not sell them or otherwise use them for commercial purposes.</p>

					<h4>In Detail</h4>

					<p>The files on this website, other than those in the Public Domain or which carry no restrictions on use may be downloaded to your computer, printed out for personal use, instructional use and individual-to-individual distribution, they may be copied to your own website, translated into other languages, and redistributed electronically — provided that there is no charge for them or commercial use made of them.</p>

					<p>Some texts contain additional copyright notices with specific additional rights and restrictions spelled out by the authors and publishers; please read and abide by these notices. If you republish any of these materials, please acknowledge the original author, translator, or publisher, as appropriate.</p>

					<h4>Gratis Non-commercial distribution means<br />
					Gratis Non-commercial distribution</h4>

					<p>You may not sell copies of restricted materials from this website.</p>

					<p>You may not sell copies of restricted materials from this website in order to raise money for a non-profit cause.</p>

					<p>You may not sell copies of restricted materials from this website if you charge just enough to recover the costs of printing, etc. These teachings are to be given away, not sold.</p>

					<p>'Free distribution' also means not charging someone to pay for reproduction costs or for shipping costs (packaging, postage, etc.) The fact that a person cannot receive these materials without paying these sorts of costs amounts to charging for distribution or using the texts to sell your packaging which is commercial use.</p>

					<p>You may not ask people to make a "suggested donation" in exchange for copies of these texts. If anyone asking for a copy of a work from this site that you are re-distributing may obtain it without charge and without being made to feel guilt, a clearly 'arms-length' request for a donation is not a violation of this agreement.</p>

					<p>Please be very careful here. As long as you make it crystal clear that anyone may receive a copy free for the asking — regardless of whether he or she makes a donation — then that's fine. You should put no pressure — subtle or otherwise — on anyone to pay. These teachings are to be given away, not sold.</p>

					<p>You may not give away copies of the restricted texts as a loss-leader for promotion of another product which you sell. This is 'commercial use.'</p>

					<p>Nothing in any of the above is intended to restrict your rights under the terms of 'Fair Use.'</p>
